On Mexico's Day Of The Dead festival, a convoluted series of events sees Miguel transported to the Land of the Dead, where he discovers that the dead disappear when no-one remembers them. He also discovers that unless he returns to the land of the living by dawn, he will join the dead. And there are problems ahead!The story here is very artificially structured, with all sorts of bits and pieces present s that a predetermined trail of events can be created. But you never notice that, so natural is the narrative flow.This film is highly original, full of truly gorgeous visuals, lovely songs, delightful characters, and touching resolutions to several individual story threads. And yet it appeared in the UK with no publicity, trailers, or warnings whatsoever, and my local multiscreen didn't even get it in 3D despite the fact that it is clear that the 3D would be dazzling.This is as good as any Pixar film over the last several years, and better than most.", "I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.Though the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.Coco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll.", "Coco is about Dias de las Muerte (Day of the Dead), family, family crises and musical passion. The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.We were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)It surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. \"there will be no X in this family!\" X being \"instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past\". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?Did I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them \"mama, I miss you.\"Beautiful.", "As a Mexican born child I cried when I saw this movie and my son who is American born with Mexican parents loves it too.. love to teach him about our roots71 out of 85 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I'm no critic, but Coco is close to movie perfection. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, no doubt, and is by far the best animated movie ever created. The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life. Fantastic, I am blown away.125 out of 156 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about in a small Mexican town.Or, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.I got my wish.This is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken.This is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.I can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.To watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.Thank you, Pixar.", "Coco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On D\u00eda de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music.In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of D\u00eda de Muertos.Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel.Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about D\u00eda de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about D\u00eda de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes.In high school, my understanding of D\u00eda de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly.It's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!", "We came across with the movie when flipping the channels.

To them their creations have become a science into human emotion and I don't know any better company that has nearly perfected the craft. Soon they'll have 10's across the board from music to picture and from story to the characters. Never have I seen that more than in the movie WALL-E. This movie is up there. More than just its basic elements it dared to dive into a culture that very few in the world know about. It went above and beyond in research in getting those in Mexicos stamp of approval. It touches a deeper recess of the heart where the soul lies dormant and awakens it with hope and optimism. It takes the differences we often critique and judge upon another group only for Pixar to place a mirror right in front of us and stare at our own reflection. It takes the common elements so as to identify with the characters and stir a feeling of commonality. It's brilliant and ingenious. These things alone give it an 8. The 10 is because it was bold and dared to go places other won't. In this I found originality. Something you don't see often these days. Best part of all it unified. It takes ones thick skull (pun intended) and supplies human emotion as the medium to communicate the message so as to reach the heart. One may call that manipulation but due to its sincere true message and goodness I humbly give it a 10.", "I'm a 24 year old student who sometimes tends to overthink about the values of life and how one, including myself, expresses these kinds of thoughts through every form of art that tells a story. So as a person that really puts his soul to a movie he watches I have to say that this film is one of the most beautiful things I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.Coco does a fantastic job of capturing the viewer from the first moment. It cleverly captures the beauty of the \"Day of the Dead\" tradition, by unfolding one of the most heartwarming stories I've ever seen in a movie, around it. The film features a young Musician called Miguel and the pursuit of his dream of being a musician against his family's approval. Throughout the movie while Miguel engages in an adventurous journey through the land of the dead, he is caught between the love he has for music and the importance of family bonds. \nQuiet a simple and pretty well covered subject. Somehow, Coco manages to so simply and beatifully capture the essence of what it means to be human. What it means to love and what it means to have passion for the things and the people you love. The story was told in such an elegant way that it didn't make me think about the values it represented, but instead it made me feel them, without me even analysing what I was watching. It did it so gradually that at some point near the end I was so overwhelmed by a scene, which definetely goes to my \"top 10 best movie scenes\" list, that I caught myself crying. Not tearing up like I usually do when a scene touches me. Actually crying.I could go on and on about Coco, but I'll leave with saying that this is a fantastic movie and I honestly feel grateful that I had the chance to watch it.A must see!!!", "Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few \"adult\" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.RATING: 10.0/10.0", "Pixar has done it AGAIN! 'Coco' is a yet another delightful ride from the prolific animation studio, who's winning streak seems to never end. And that's good for all, since 'Coco' is all heart & soul, rewarding the moviegoer wholeheartedly.'Coco' Synopsis: Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.'Coco' captures the themes of Life & Death, with genuine feeling. Themes of family, passion, defeat & redemption also are explored here, but with humor & real emotion. While I laughed for a good share of this winning story, I also found myself weeping in the film's final-act. This is a true fantasy-adventure, that gives life & death true meaning.Adrian Molina & Matthew Aldrich's Screenplay is excellent. Lee Unkrich's Direction is colorful. And of course, the Animation is extraordinary. 'Coco' unfolds gorgeously & not for a second, does the pace drop.Vocal-Performances are top-notch! Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, the protagonist, is a joy, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal s H\u00e9ctor Rivera, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de la Cruz, the most famous musician in the history of Mexico and Miguel's idol & Ana Ofelia Murgu\u00eda as Mam\u00e1 Socorro \"Coco\" Rivera, Miguel's great-grandmother, stand out.

In short, one of the best landings of Pixar - perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a \"back to basics\" in terms of the narrative, history and character development, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh and purposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about.131 out of 220 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "All my family waiting this movie all the year since we see the teaser and blow up...and more because was a Pixar movie and they all make right all the movies they make (at least the 80%).And Jesus we all not disappointed at all...The music,the animation,the characters,the colors,the family...everything was just perfect.Now being a Mexican born a was worried that Pixar takes so many liberties of the Mexican culture,people,music and more...But that didn't happen they took all the things i mention before and converted in one of the best animated pictures i ever see and make me even more proud to born Mexican.I know you all the see the trailers and teasers and know how the movie it is but NO...the movie have a great twist and surprises that gonna make you love the movie even more...Like i say before everything in the movie is just perfect and one i have to say is that PIXAR portrait The day of the Death (dia de los muertos) very accurate and with a lot of respect.Just see it...you gonna love it Pixar make another classic movie to they collection and Mexican people of all the world...You be pride to be what you are!", "It was great.

Just take a look at Toy Story 3 (99%), Up (98%), Inside Out (98%), and Wall-e (96%). As for this year, we have Coco. As I write this review, Coco already gained a score of 96% on the aforementioned website. Well, it turns out that critics (almost) never wrong when it comes to scoring. Coco helps viewers to remember that no one ever truly dies as long as the memories about them, be it good or bad, live inside the hearts and minds of their loved ones, that the real and true death comes when the records of the dead simply vanished and no one is left to keep them safe and sound inside their neuron system, a cruel fate that everyone on the planet share sooner or later. As terrifying as it is, we are left with the choice of how we are going to be remembered before we fade away into nothingness, is it by doing something remarkable? something evil? something amazing? embarrassing? or just something mediocre? You decide.....Another element that I fall in love with in this movie is the plot twist and what it brings to our protagonist, Miguel, and his family, dead or alive. I mean seriously, no one would ever see that coming, the shocking revelation that will make our mouth open wide and turn the tide of the story.It wouldn't be a Disney movie if at near the end of the movie, they didn't include at least one tear-dropping scene that would almost make everyone sobbing. This time, the heartwarming conversation between our hero, Miguel, and his great-grandmother, Coco (from whom this movie gets it's title). I swear to every divine being that had been, or has been, or being, or will be worshiped by humankind, the guy who sit next to me was rubbing his eyes for a moment (and honestly, I was ready to rub mine had tears leaked from both of my eyes).So far, this movie is really fine by my standard, every generation from every corner of the globe should watch it to remind them that death is not something to be afraid of for it is a part of our life that everyone will undergo someday, that no one ever truly dies, as long as someone still remember them in their memories, forever and ever.", "If you agree with the 'family comes first\" motto, but are tired of it being linked solely to the muscular bald guys and fast cars, then Coco will become a pleasant refreshment for you. A lush and lovingly made animation film based on the Dia de los Muertos theme from the Mexican culture, it is a touching experience and a joy to watch.However, after all the praise Coco received from all around, the actual viewing experience has left me slightly disappointed. Maybe because I did watch The Book of Life, another animation inspired by the Dia de los Muertos lore and featuring the similar \"family wishes vs personal destination\" conflict, a film some consider Coco to be a rip-off of. Or maybe it's because, despite all its pretty visuals, cute characters and singing solid enough, Coco clearly doesn't invest too much into having more than a single layer of meaning.You see, here we have a painted prettily and with lots of fizzy buoyant quirks, but still a rather simplistic take on the eternal topic of love's duality and generations' conflict. A kid who loves music, but hatred for it is a family trait for several generations, so he embarks on an unexpected journey through the world of the dead to find a way to unite again what has once been separated and to mend what was once broken. And to sing a few songs and to battle some personal fears while he's at it. There are some nice and emotional scenes along the way, and some lessons learned for some characters, but it's still more or less a linear journey from A to B where good is mostly good (although not without a typical feminine touch of a raging maelstrom of emotionality), and bad is, well, at least clearly selfish from the get-go, and then it's plain outright evil.What is missing in my opinion is the multi-facet delivery, or at least a deeper morals of the story. Sure, \"love your relatives and do what you believe in\" is cool, but ain't it what every single animated film is eventually about? And you could reach the ending inevitable for such genre with some more convoluted and morally difficult effort than just being a boisterous music prodigy with tons of luck to his aid.It's not a good idea to criticize art for not meeting your expectations. After all, nobody does it just for you, so why what you think must matter at all? Still, if you are not too fond of stories being rather straightforward, then Coco might feel somewhat shallow. And if you're not a kid who loves everything shiny and moving, then the second half of the film might feel kinda random, slapstick'y and, at times, on seriously heavy drugs (the color-changing monkey burping blue flames or multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya to drink an even more giant cactus' tears being some examples). For you, I might recommend watching The Book of Life instead, which, albeit arguably less glossy and vibrant visually, has a story much more complex and not stamping \"good\" and \"evil\" labels on things, thus showing the duality of people and of the life itself.For everyone else, go ahead and watch this film. For its loving care for the Mexican traditions, sharing not just the language but also the passion for something outside the typical Western outlook. And clearly for the multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya - that was hilarious beyond all sane measure!", "Well Disney and pixar really make such a great movies this year, kinda classic, but you know i love all the character, the color of the picture , and of course the story line , story twist.

It's a visual marvel, a musical phenomenon that has three dimensional characters, top-notch voice acting, great sense of humor, a wonderful, deep message and some really emotional moments that will surely make you cry.

In the real world, Pixar has tended a symbolic bridge with this film to link Mexicans, Chicanos (U.S.-based Mexicans and their descendants), U.S. nationals and the world via one of our most difficult shared human experiences. This isn't a movie spearheaded by Mexican artists to introduce the world to one of our beloved idiosyncrasies, like the inevitably comparable \"The Book of Life\" (a movie that I like but have far more issues with as a film fan than \"Coco\", regardless of nationality) but to simplify it as \"a culturally appropriative work by a non-Mexican\" would be to not only miss the point of the story told in it but to miss the point in its creation as well.Lee Unkrich and the team at Pixar clearly went at great lengths to not only understand the holiday itself but also how to best present it to those unfamiliar. There's also a clear effort to try and understand the culture(s) that originate, adapt and celebrate the holiday (or as much as one can \"understand\" Mexico in anything less than a lifetime). Why so much effort? What one can infer from interviews with Unkrich is that his decision to make the movie came from a place of genuine admiration and curiosity. Filtered through Pixar's famously thorough work ethic in the service of storytelling, you end up with a film fruit of both love and intelligent, hard work, clear in many of the filmmaking decisions.For those in the know, Mexican Spanish expressions are uttered without subtitles, national celebrities (or at least their skeletal avatars) appear and are paid tribute, the cultural differences between regions of Mexico are alluded to, the movie is clearly set in the modern day and respect for the country, its people and sometimes complicated family dynamics is on display. Regarding our relatives north of the border and elsewhere, the cast of the film is more Chicano than Mexican-born and the more internationally-popular term \"D\u00eda de LOS Muertos\" is as common as our preferred \"D\u00eda de Muertos\". For those complete outsiders to the holiday, its emotionality and symbolism are explained just the right amount to follow the plot yet leaving some air of mystery while Santa Cecilia is not too far from that most-familiar depiction of small, dusty colonial towns as the face of Mexico. All these compromises show that the film is intended as a message of unity and understanding. Yes, some references will definitely fly over many audiences' heads, but the Pixar magic lies in that, making some parts of the film so specific, they've managed to turn the whole universal.Mexicans, a people defined by a tug-of-war between indigenous, European, personal, global and other identities that work best when balance between them is achieved, are a prime example of the importance of finding what's universal. Our holiday dedicated to \"let's turn mourning into joy\" may seem incongruous but it comes from the observation of joy and death as being equally unifying. We're all united by knowing joy, some of it courtesy of those who've passed on. We're all united by and equal in death, to every being that's ever lived. The death of beloved ones brings us memories, their memories bring us joy, this is the essence of D\u00eda de Muertos. \"Coco\"'s noble essence, par for the course of the Pixar canon (perhaps not as bold as \"Wall-E\" or \"Monsters University\", but bold enough) is to bridge the relatively small gaps between personal passion and responsibility, Mexas and others, on the same level as those huge gaps between joy and mourning, death and life. Thanks to the respectful research and collaborations behind the film, its essence not only aligns with that of the holiday, but hopefully will complement and strenghten each other, for years to come, for every early November night that we remember... and smile.", "Coco (2017) is an animated film co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. It is a story set in the fictitious Mexican town of Santa Cecilia, where young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) embarks on a journey when his passion in life and dreams are called into question by his family. All Miguel wants from this life is emulating the great and famous singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) but his abuela and relatives oppose. Miguel must come to terms with his family and return back home after he disrespects the \"dia de los muertos\" tradition and a curse falls upon him, trapping him with the dead. He finds help from the deceased Hector (Gael Garcia) and members of his family like Mama Imelda (Alana Ubach) as he finds a way to express his talents and learns family history.At its core Coco is a story about passion, memory and family. Miguel follows a story arch where he must learn self value, bravery and the value of being true to one's self while remaining loyal to family, respecting tradition and remembering one's past in the form of family history. With a reputation for great storytelling, juggernauts Disney and Pixar have found a way to tell a story with such a worn arch with a new and authentic style. A lesson is learned by almost every main character as they grow and develop. Passion is pitted against tradition (and perhaps stubborn customs) and the outcome produces strong emotions on the viewer. At times the story felt carried itself with the drama and flair of a Mexican \"Telenovela\". These are some rich themes for what may be considered a \"kid's film\" but they develop organically and are never forced. However the film doesn't lack that slapstick humour or easy and quirky kid's comedy (Especially present in the playfulness of the dead characters' bones).The production team made a respectable effort preparing for the production of this film, and the results were worthwhile and evident. The film is brilliantly set in Mexico, showcasing a wide range of customs and cultural icons that made the film feel authentic. Everything from Mexican cuisine (Like tacos, tamales or \"pan de muerto\") to celebrities (Like Frida Kahlo, El Santo, Pedro Infante or Cantinflas) make an appearance. Traditional \"Mariachi\" or \"Charro\" suits and elaborate woman hairstyles are accurately represented. Mexican family culture is accurately represented from the respect towards our loving, stern and kiss filling abuelas, to that spicy and sassy personality characteristic of Mexican and Latin women. Even the idolization of popular musical icons, similar to Ernesto de la Cruz in the film, resembles the decades old fascination with the likes of actual celebrities like Pedro Infante or Jose Alfredo Jimenez. I authentically felt the story was set in a real, picturesque Mexican pueblo. Every small detail felt in place and that enhanced the story. The film understands and respects the traditions of \"dia de los muertos\" while giving it a modern twist. Despite the difficulties, and risks, that come with portraying such a rich and complex culture the film makes a much appreciated effort in introducing a side of Mexican culture that is at times neglected in favour of easy-to-go stereotypes.The film felt beautifully animated with intricate finger movements while playing a worn-out guitar or the miniscule pores and imperfections of the bones. Visually gorgeous and impressive the film makes use of a brightly coloured pallet, like with the rich orange used for the \"cempazuchitl\" flowers or the \"papel picado\" banners. The music fit perfectly with the tone used for the story and never stopped having a particularly Mexican flavour from the use of the guitar or trumpets to the \"marimba\". The score continued to set the story appropriately.Coco is carried by memorable fun moments, like Miguel's encounter with exotic Frida Kahlo, and beautiful and emotionally filled ones, such as that of the last act which grounded the story's themes of love for music and family during a scene that is sure to invoke a tear or two. Despite a few moments where it felt that the plot was driven by the oversimplified and unexplained mechanics of the curse, the film in general doesn't stop being the memorable and enjoyable experience of a familiar story executed with fresh and authentic style.", "In the begining I want expecting the movie will be OK, but Pixar done a great great work.

To me a movie is a movie and this was good for a kids movie but still incredibly formulaic with an obvious ending. I guess we'll have to see how much lower the score goes for this movie as at the time of this review its a 9/10, but its still just shocking to me to see it that high even though it's early. It truly is Pixar's 8th best movie at most and it's an alright idea but at the end of the day it's just a check all the boxes average movie. And that's okay; it's an alright kids movie but it doesn't deserve the praise people are showering it with.131 out of 435 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "\"Coco\" its the latest Disney Pixar animated film, I try not to miss that many Pixar movies and even if a few of them have escaped me I still do whatever I can do to watch them, I love a good Disney movie and \"Coco\" its no exception.I know that the gimmick this time its that it takes elements from the Mexican tradition known as El dia de los muertos (actually, it takes elements from general Mexican culture) but I cant help to feel that this is a small story that happens to take place in a huge startling world, we follow our characters through a journey that only affects them, the rest of the world does not depend on their fate but they aren't apathetic towards them, its a nice balance between a big story and a personal one.The plot isn't anything special, the world it establishes isn't special either, the characters are likable but they aren't great, except for a few of them like our main lead who carries the whole movie (as it should be), yet I wish they would have developed the rest of the family a little more or at least in a better way.The movie opens with exposition, as many modern Pixar movies do, I remember \"Moana\" doing this too, it doesn't bother me that much, I know that there's a lot to explain and to establish, so I just go along with it until it stops giving us information and tries to have actual scenes, when we get to them they are worth it. While I do like movie I will say it hits all the story beats a movie like this would, its not original, its quite predictable and melodramatic at points, but its effective, for whatever flaws it may have, never do they break the mood and they feel somewhat insignificant when compared to the wonders the film offers. The themes and subjects it plays with are familiar to me, physical death isn't the worst thing awaiting man and the pursuit of a dream will take away part of you.I was predicting where it would go and I was also awaiting for an specific moment to come, as I knew that it will be executed perfectly, and it was. I had a good time watching this, when its not being good its about as average as you can get, that goes to show how superior Pixar is to the rest, when they are not being exceptional they on the same level as their competition.", "Beautiful, almost perfect, at last a movie that honors our roots and not making fun with them. The music, the colors, the allusion to one of our most beloved stars Pedro Infante, humor is excellent, not falling into racist jokes as all movies about Mexicans are, the voices, a lot of Mexican talent and legends, it includes most of our typical details, since a Cempasuchil flower to Alebrijes everywhere, the sensitive part is very touching and even more for us Mexicans that we are deeply connected with our family and ancestors.

It's nowhere even near the same level as Toy Story 3, Inside Out, Up and WALL\u0095E. It went on for too long, some scenes dragged and weren't that entertaining. The first half especially was extremely dull, I literally just didn't know why I was watching the film. But the day of the dead scenes were kinda entertaining and quite a bit of fun. That was really when the film started to pick itself up a bit. The animation is spectacular and I'm glad that Pixar satisfied me with their stunning visuals, like they always do. The characters are good-fun and are people you can definitely relate to. Miguel is a great lead and when he's stuck with these skeleton-like people (I don't know what to call them, sorry!), it really is a lot of fun and entertaining. Although I didn't even enjoy Coco that much, I'm pretty sure you will, I'm pretty sure you'd like to watch it.I enjoyed this one less then Cars 3 but give it a watch, and if you don't want to, don't. The first 40-50 minutes you may not be entertained or satisfied like I was, but you will be surprised and amazed and the second half. My overall review of the film is that it's not bad, watch it if you want to.", "Kinda disappointed with this one. Coco could've been a cultural statement and a exploration of family values and death itself, but instead is a rather dull look at a celebration, not a tradition. The aesthetic qualities are there, as well as the overall depiction of current Mexican society (sort of), but everything else feels poor in comparison, vane even. The protagonist's journey lacks actual purpose, the writers seem more focused in the real adventure that in the metaphorical one. He doesn't grow or mature. And that is just one of the many issues this movie has. At the end, it's just another decent tearjerker children film.84 out of 291 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I did not watch this in 3D.Before I begin with \"CoCo\", I would like to state that the Frozen featurette before the film, not in 3D, was extremely boring and the Frozen shorts are becoming increasingly worn-out. Olaf is not funny and the jokes quickly get old after the first one. When he got lost, I thought, great he's gone, we can move on. When I found out the family tradition was Olaf, that was the \"perfect\" cap to an annoying featurette. In Mexico, people were so annoyed by it that they completely took it away and are not making viewers watch it at all. We are not so lucky.First off, I will state that I do speak Spanish and have a high respect for the cultural traditions represented in this movie. I love how Disney is highlighting a variety of cultures and making a sincere attempt to creating high-quality movies that showcase aspects from these cultures.I love all the cultural elements of this movie. Others tend to pick apart every minor flaw or even a perceived misunderstanding of a cultural element to enhance the entertainment value. This movie made me want to go home and look up the history of \"Dia de Muertos\" to compare it to details I saw in the movie.All 5 of my points go to highlighting these aspects of Mexican culture and also to the last 30 minutes of the movie, which was actually entertaining.The boring featurette was actually the beginning of a mostly boring movie. Typically I will not laugh at all Disney jokes, but usually there are a few that have me chuckling. This had none, not one. There were a few mediocre attempts at humor that I can count on one hand, but none were actually funny. I heard one or two strained laughs in the whole theater at each decent joke. It was a total of maybe 5-6 laughs the whole movie out of 100 viewers.The beginning 30-45 minutes was meant to highlight Mexican family culture, but was extremely boring. I had thoughts of walking out at the 30 minute mark. It was almost painfully boring. At that point, I was embarrassed to have bought a ticket to watch \"Coco.\"The main storyline is that a distant relative(great, great grandfather I believe) of Miguel was a musician and walked out on the family. The great, great grandmother banished all music from the home at that point and based the family around making shoes. There are roughly 30 minutes dedicated to hitting home this point over and over again. The remainder of the of the movie is loosely based on the fact that Miguel's family hates music.However, Miguel wants to be a musician. In the end, he becomes a musician. The End.There were a couple of things that left me scratching my head that just didn't make sense. The main one was how Miguel made it to the Land of the Dead. He strummed a guitar and instantly became a \"ghost\". I never understood why this happened and no explanation was offered at any point. This sets up the remainder of the movie with Miguel trying to get back to the world of the living, so it would seem somewhat important to offer some explanation why strumming the guitar would make him enter the Land of the Dead. However, he doesn't become completely dead. Only the dead \"skeletons\" can see or talk to him. Regular humans can't. But he still remains in his normal living body. However, he is slowly becoming a skeleton and will be completely a skeleton by morning. He can only get back by a family member's blessing. But if they send you back, they can also give you other conditions, such as never playing music again. If you break those conditions, you are instantly sent back to the Land of the Dead. There is no explanation where any of this came from.At this point, I'm questioning why I should care about any of this. The saving character to the film is Hector. After seeing Hector in action with Miguel, you actually start to care about his character. This really is the only reason to care about anything that is going on in the movie.When you see that Hector is about to vanish even from the Land of the Dead, it really hooks you in and you want Miguel to make it back. Before this, I didn't care about any of it really. However, does a good last 30 minutes make up for the remainder of the film? I'm not sure. I'm sure many people will walk out with that good feeling in their heart that Hector was saved and forget about an hour or more of boredom they had to endure before that.I just cannot let go of the fact of how bad and boring that first 1 hour of the movie was. The jokes were bad...so bad.", "Have always loved Pixar, and really like to love most of their films (all three 'Cars' films and 'The Good Dinosaur' are my least favourites, and although the second 'Cars' had a lot of problems for me the third one is the only less than average one).As for favourites, they are all three 'Toy Story' films, 'Inside Out' and 'Up', love 'Wall-E' and 'Finding Nemo' as well. After seeing 'Coco' yesterday, hearing nothing but great things about it and seeing the near-universal critical acclaim, from personal opinion (and many others it seems) it is right up there with the Pixar masterpieces. Would go as far to say it is easily their best since 'Inside Out', which is saying a lot since the films between that and this were lesser Pixar efforts (enjoyed 'Finding Dory' though, though it is a long way from being one of Pixar's best).'Coco' is one of the longest Pixar films, clocking in at nearly two hours, but it sure didn't feel like it. Seeing it in the cinema, the audience was a quite large one, if on a side note not as many as thought. With it being a family film, the weekend and that it was only released three days ago, part of me was thinking it would be sold out. Throughout everybody, children and adults alike, was laughing, in awe and crying. It is also a different Pixar film, with a unique setting and that it is more music/song-oriented, and has replaced 'Inside Out' as their most mature and in depth, with themes that are remarkably daring and relevant.Lets talk about what is so brilliant about 'Coco'. The film is a triumph when it comes to visuals, one of Pixar's best-looking easily. The animation throughout is absolutely spectacular, whether in the real world or the Land of the Dead. The colours are so vibrant and atmospheric and there is so much gorgeous detailing in the backgrounds, nuances in the way the characters look and the skeletal designs and movements have amazing dexterity that is both clever and ghoulish.Just as triumphant is the music. Michael Giacchino's score is one of his best and most multi-layered, capturing the spirit of Mexico in a way that's celebratory. The songs are similarly infectious, \"Remember Me\" is not just a beautiful song but it has a great, upbeat message and adds a lot to the story.The writing has so much spirit, poignancy and entertainment value. The jokes are sophisticated and amusing, neither childish or repetitive to me and Dante is both adorable and funny, and the emotional elements are truly heartfelt, especially in the last act. The story is bright and breezy in pacing, despite the fairly long length one doesn't feel it. The Mexican culture and family values were clearly comprehensively researched and the film feels like a warm, fun and heartfelt tribute and celebration to culture, family, music and even Latino cinema in the Golden Age (the latter proving crucial to the revelation of a major plot twist).Not since 'Inside Out' has a Pixar film made me laugh and bring tears to my eyes as much as 'Coco' did, not since 'Paddington 2' has a film's ending leave me sobbing. The relationship between Hector and Miguel has a huge amount of heart and complexity, one can understand the point of view of the Rivera family (living and dead) and the macabre elements are very imaginatively realised.The twists in particularly the last act keep coming, mostly unexpected and all very clever. Some elements of the reveal with Ernesto were not that surprising (Pixar have done similar and it is fairly clich\u00e9d, my one slight criticism with 'Coco' but found it easy to overlook) but none of it was guessable too early and it was extremely well done and tense regardless.All the characters are fully formed and have strengths and flaws. Hector was the most fully rounded and provided the most heart and a lot of us are likely to find ourselves in Miguel and his aspirations. Imelda is also memorable as a character and the chemistry between all the characters is realised beautifully too.Voice acting is first rate, especially the remarkably multi-faceted contribution from Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as Hector. Anthony Gonzalez also voices with spirit and emotion, Alanna Ubach achieves a balance to Imelda of not wanting to get on the wrong side of her and having a caring side and Benjamin Bratt shows a side that one is surprised is in him.In summary, truly amazing and a celebration of a lifetime. One of the most deserving recipients of a perfect score in a while. 10/10 Bethany Cox", "Coco is an animated film, centered on Mexican culture and Latino music, and mostly celebrated in Mexico, which is no big surprise. I liked the message (or maybe messages) it suggests to a child audience and also the whole idea of representing the world of the dead. However, as with most Disney films, everything gets excessively sentimental and \"Disneyfied\" here, not offering too much to the adult audience and making it simply a children's film. The film uses many (potentially) powerful assets to build up a great piece, but sadly it fails in most departments. For instance, we see the dead people made out of moving bones and adjustable skeletons, but very few \"funny\" gags are developed out of this rich context. Any reasons why? Because film makers were seemingly more fascinated by the overall looks and visual elements of the film, rather than being creative and genuine. The film is about music, but you can't really find a decent score throughout the whole film and the beats are not catchy enough to stay with you afterwards. Miguel enters the land of the dead right after he steals a guitar, but no further explanations are given about how and why did this journey happen to this particular boy? I count that as a plot hole. One implicit lesson embedded into this film, which is a big plus also, is about recognizing the unknown and uncredited artists that are actually the real backbones of the industry, and give credit to them, where credit is due. But surprisingly, the villain of the film, Ernesto de la cruz, who is a legendary singer-songwriter and also a big liar, is an exact replica of Queen's Freddie Mercury, with his shaded eyes, striking cheekbones and that iconic suit. Actually the reference couldn't get more blatant right after he threw Miguel off the cliff and said: \"The Show Must Go On!\" What a coincidence? And why do you have to reference a real world legend as a deceiver? All in all, despite all its good moments, Coco didn't meet my overall expectations.", "There was once a time when Pixar movies were guaranteed to bring something new, fresh and exciting to the CG animation game. You just knew it, Pixar was going to raise the bar again with every new movie, not only animation wise but also regarding story telling and characters. Even after Disney completely took over Pixar in 2006 they still created very special movies like \"Ratatouille\" and \"Wall-E\" and I had hopes that Disney would let them do their thing and keep out of the stories and the way they tell them to the audience... but when \"Merida\" came I knew it was going downhill from here... it had such a typical Disney vibe. Now with \"Coco\" the \"Disneyfication\" has been completed. Don\u00b4t get me wrong - technically and animation wise everything is still top notch - but the story telling and characters are 100% Disney. The story you\u00b4re going to see has been told to us a hundered times already, they just changed the setting. Of course they added the unavoidable schmaltzy musical songs (this time in mexican style flavor, but you know the melodies... oh yes, you know \u00b4em... ), the funny sidekicks, the unresolved father - son conflict, the \"first you\u00b4re a hero to me and then not so much\" turn, the predictable teared up happy ending ... this might appeal a very young audience, but me as an adult who loves a good animation movie (Pixars \"The Incredibles\" being my all time favorite) this made me cringe.", "Perfection.

That's an offence to Pixar itself.\nCoco is a visually pleasing animated film, with stunning colors, nothing more.\nI was disappointed, I really thought a Pixar movie on the Day of the Dead could have great potential, but that potential was wasted.Rather than a celebration of Mexican culture, what I have seen is a celebration of the American perception of Mexican culture (in a respectful way, at least). This was no surprise though. \nWhat made it impossible for me to enjoy this movie was the way the plot was sacrificed in order to deliver the \"Be who you want to be\" lesson. The first part of the movie focuses so much on this one idea, with so many clich\u00e9s it even made me consider leaving the theater.But as I said, the colors make it a pretty film and I was hoping I'd be enjoying some of Pixar's excellent humor at some point. That never came. This movie will make you chuckle a couple times, but that's it, it lack's Pixar's magical combination of plot, humor and feelings.They came up with one or two good ideas and Death is depicted in a really nice way, but the plot was so scarcely developed some events remain unexplained. Completely useless elements are given a lot of importance within the story, while the truly interesting bits get very little space. Coco simply didn't \"seize the moment\".", "Gloriously animated, \"Coco\" takes about twenty minutes to really get going, but when it does, it's an absolute delight for the senses. The animation is strikingly detailed without distracting from the plot, bringing to life a colorful world that's truly unlike anything I've seen in an animated movie before. The musical sequences are alternately gorgeous and touching, full of life and vigor without straying into obnoxiousness, and the movie's characters are well-rounded and engaging. But what makes \"Coco\" all the more impressive is its sprawling, sympathetic narrative, which finds its titular character lost in the afterworld while attempting to find a long-dead relative to benedict his burgeoning love of music. It allows the production team nearly limitless opportunities to create a self-contained world defined by its splendor and its peculiarities, and the finished product is stamped with a deliberate, unique visual and sonic identity. It's a great movie for all ages, but it will surely hold more meaning for those who already have an appreciation for music.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Once a year in Mexico, people bring treats to a graveyard where they hope to contact the dead and\u0085wait a minute, isn't this the Christmas season? What's with the sudden Halloween ideas? Actually, this is a special day called Dia de Muertos (in English, that would be the Day of the Dead) where the dark reality of death is suddenly made colorful and an embraced part of life. Death is not seen as an end, as the connection to our loved ones is how they still remain a part of us, even when their gone. The Day of the Dead remains a celebrated day in Mexico, and even the United States.There is something to those who say that they feel the spirits of their loved ones. Perhaps it's the connection of the memories or maybe it is their ghosts that are there to remind them that they'll always be watching. You could argue that these people are the closest to their families if they still consider their ancestors a vital member of the family. The Day of the Dead for this reason, stresses the importance of togetherness and family, which is why I have to recommend Coco for everyone this holiday season.Within the Rivera family, a group of shoemakers, music is outright banned in the household, even though 12 year old Miguel (played by Anthony Gonzalez) wants to follow his hero Ernesto de la Cruz (played by Benjamin Bratt) and become a famous musician. It's explained that about four generations ago, one of the Riveras became a musician and never returned home. In turn, the now abandoned wife become a shoemaker, and the rest of the family followed suit. Regardless of ban that's heavily enforced by his grandmother Imelda, Miguel constantly watches Ernesto's old movies, performances, and listens to his most popular song, \"Remember Me\".When Miguel wants to enter a local talent show, he tries acquiring a guitar by steeling the one within Ernesto's tomb. As soon as he strums it, he suddenly finds that he cannot be seen by the living and can now see skeletons visiting their families during the current Day of the Dead. His skeleton ancestors tell him that they can get him home, but under the condition that he can't play music. Not wanting to accept that, he travels through the land of the dead to find Ernesto in order to get a non-binding blessing from him.I will flat out say it: Coco may now be one of my favorite Disney movies. This is a film where everything happens to be beautiful. The story is beautiful. The characters are beautiful. The animation is beautiful. The voice work is beautiful. But why is it all beautiful? A lot of that falls on the overall story and plot where everything the child goes through feels warranted and earned. It's almost never predictable and kept me going on trying to figure out where everything was going to lead; not just for our hero but for his family.Coco has one of the most original designed worlds in a while, fitting in with other imaginative worlds like Metropolis, Blade Runner, and Batman. It is huge, looking like it could hold the population of the dead, with every part of it looking lived in. It blossoms in color, turning a world of darkness into a work of art. Coco took advantage of an underworld that has a majority Mexican inspiration and ran with every direction possible. Seeing this on the big screen made it all seem like a dream I never wanted to leave\u0085and this is from someone who didn't see it in 3D.Of course I have to address the music. It represents everything fun and spiritual that Mexico is capable of. Though the movie is not technically a musical, it does come close with how songs are sung and just how their placed. I can already bet that \"Remember Me\" will get the phrase through it's sweeps at the award season. But without giving away how that song progresses, I'd like to address \"Un Poco Loco\" which I'd love to know if it was an original song for the movie. It's a funny little but that seems fitting for it's moment.

Hoping to win, the local talent show, he steals a guitar off a dead man, and find himself accidentally transported to the land of the dead, where he must seeks the help of his instrumentalist great, great grandfather to return him to his family among the living. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, it seems like similar film, 20th Century Fox, 2014's computer animation film 'the Book of Life' has shown everything special about the Mexican holiday of D\u00eda de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) to families, around the world. In contrast, Pixar & Disney Studios, with their own unique visuals style, not only show the holiday, mostly culturally sensitive right with their use colorful, beautifully computer animated of holiday decorations, but also the history of Mexican art culture, accuracy as well. We see that, with their homage to real life deceased Mexican celebrities, including Frida Kahlo, Mario Moreno, El Santo, Jorge Negrete, & Pedro Infante, through muralism art, music, lucha libre mask & fictional cameos. Nevertheless, not all the visuals from 'Coco' work. Some of the Easter Eggs, Pixar used, was a bit jarring. Although, it was pretty cool to see cameos items from other Pixar films. It just doesn't work with the world, Lee Unkrich & his crew, are trying to build. It was also a bit jolting to see Alebrije in the afterlife; when in truth, both really have barely anything to do with each other. Still, like the Pixar cameos; seeing the xoloitzcuintli, become one in the end is only a small nitpick. After all, it was also a nice smart nod to the famous author of 'The Divine Comedy', even if the book technically, not from Mexican culture. As for the writing, I thought, 'Coco' told a more focus and accuracy version of life & death with unique twist and turns, a little better than the other movie, even if bits of 'Coco's foreshadowing is a little shallow & predictable. While, the afterlife sequences still contains some potentially disturbing imagery, most kids will probably get used to all, quickly. However, a few others tension might be, a little rough such as the out of nowhere, murder subplot. It's been days, I'm still shock, on how the villain manage not being caught for his crimes for so long, even after he admits to poisoning on film. Nor do I understand, why he would do that, in story. Does, he have that huge of an ego!? Also, is it just me, or does it seem odd, that, the character can't write music, but he's somehow able to write scripts. It's bizarre; just like how dead people have jobs in the afterlife, even, when there is no such thing as money. Nevertheless, while both movies has huge gaps of logic. These two parallel works couldn't be more different with the direction. After all, D\u00eda de los Muertos was never, truly about one man stuck between the battles between two supernatural beings for the rights to own the dead. It was, about the rights of the dead to visit, their love ones; which 'Coco' really did capitalize on, better. Because of this, I found 'Coco' to be a little more emotional well rounded for the viewers than the far out there, epic fantasy 'Book of Life' ever could be. Despite being a little clich\u00e9s & over familiar; powerful themes of perseverance, teamwork, and appreciate your their family, while following your dreams will make audience love this movie, even a little more. Trust me, when I say this, there were a lot of moments, throughout 'Coco', where the audience will indeed shed a tear or two. It will be especially moving for anyone who's had to separate from their family, whether because of death or another reasons. There is also smart commentary on the immigration complications that it's happening, in today's world. Even if we're not from that culture, deep inside us, we can all relate to the story of their struggles. This rare musical story from Pixars really get you to felt something, regardless. While, the screen writing was mostly alright; the songs in the film, such as \"Remember Me,\" an original song from Robert and Kristen Lopez and other songs written and produced by a team of Mexican songwriters and consultants, including award winning composer Michael Giacchino score, will make you cry, cheer and laugh with its five different musical versions (Ranchero, Lullaby, Reminiscing, Power Ballard, and Pop Version). Not only that, but \"Coco\" original soundtrack felt more of authentic with its Latin Mariachi sounding songs, than the other movie's generic bubble gum homage covers of popular US billboard track music. Because of that, I felt that 'Coco's music will be a little more memorable, over time. Another thing that help this movie separate itself from the other movie is that all the voice actors were, in fact, Latinos. It's nice to see that; since, providing Latin American's cultures through speech is really hard to pull, if you're not from there. All of the voice performers in 'Coco' did a great job, singing and acting, both in Spanish & English. However, the Spanish version does have some problems. One is the title. Not only does 'Coco' mean supernatural connections, but sadly, it's also means, the name, the native people of Mexico gave to smallpox. Nevertheless, that wasn't the only problem with Disney & Latin American relationship. Trademarking 'Dia de los Muertos' for merchandising applications, also cause controversial. Other marketing blunder, Disney did, was attached this film with badly receive, critical failure 2017's short film, 'Olaf's Frozen Adventure'. Replaying 'Dante's lunch' (2017) would mesh better. Despite that, overall: I have to say, heavily idealistic, emotional, and touching. 'Coco' is a must watch. Viva Mexico!", "This movie having an average rating of 8.5 at the moment is to me just another proof that the rating and review system of this site is completely out of order...Pixar used to be all about telling great stories with a lot of playful creativity and originality thrown into the mix. But what Coco is just yet another sad example of is that they've found their \"successful\" formula as well as they've settled into a certain safe way of doing everything. This is the same story we've seen a million times before: A kid has a dream for his future but is prevented to follow that dream because of the surroundings he lives in (in this case his family), and of course he goes on a journey that changes everything and he can eventually live this dream. This is basically A Bugs Life (and a million other similar stories) in a Mexican setting but without anything new and original added. The main plot twists where so super obvious that you spent half the film waiting for them to be revealed... Also all the structure around the story - the flow of the story, the supporting characters, the way it's animated, the many little slap-stick (supposedly) humorous elements - it all reeks of habits and \"let's just stay in our comfort zone and play it safe\".... And this from the company that gave us Toy Story 2 (my favourite in the series), Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, and Wall-E.Pixar, I'm not angry but I'm extremely disappointed in the direction you've taken in later years. I mean, the film isn't all bad, it's just nothing like what Pixar used to stand for.5/10 (= almost OK, but still felt like a waste of time)", "I honestly don't understand all of the ecstatic reviews for this movie.

That's the one word I have for this latest Disney/Pixar computer-animated feature. Based on Mexican folklore, Coco is quite a wondrous display of storytelling, music, images, and touching drama. It concerns a boy who wants to play music against his family's wishes which would be because of an ancestor who abandoned his family for a career in such a profession. We think his ancestor was one person but turns out to be another...oh, just watch and be very touched especially when the song \"Remember Me\" is performed.

To them their creations have become a science into human emotion and I don't know any better company that has nearly perfected the craft. Soon they'll have 10's across the board from music to picture and from story to the characters. Never have I seen that more than in the movie WALL-E. This movie is up there. More than just its basic elements it dared to dive into a culture that very few in the world know about. It went above and beyond in research in getting those in Mexicos stamp of approval. It touches a deeper recess of the heart where the soul lies dormant and awakens it with hope and optimism. It takes the differences we often critique and judge upon another group only for Pixar to place a mirror right in front of us and stare at our own reflection. It takes the common elements so as to identify with the characters and stir a feeling of commonality. It's brilliant and ingenious. These things alone give it an 8. The 10 is because it was bold and dared to go places other won't. In this I found originality. Something you don't see often these days. Best part of all it unified.

I'd thought it sounded rather macabre but thanks to this see that it is really something rather beautiful; a day to remember dead family members. As one would expect the animation is great as were the detailed backgrounds. The central story of a child trying to return from a spirit world strongly reminded me of Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away'; the execution is quite different though so I never felt this was copying that film. One might think that a film about characters who are dead might be a bit creepy for younger viewers but the character designs aren't scary; in fact I think the film could be shown to children wondering about death.

Having no knowledge or real interest in the Day of the Dead festival I wasn't really bothered about this film at all, and also after the flop that was Moana, I thought Disney had lost it, however I am a massive Disney / Pixar fan, and willing to forgive them most things (except Meet the Robinsons) my absolute favourites being Up and Wall-E, and I thought nothing could ever come close, but by golly does this knock both out of the water.\nI've now seen Coco about a dozen times since Christmas and I've cried buckets every single time. This is film has to be Pixar's crowning glory. Absolutely love it.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Finally saw Coco. Nobody was kidding about how good it is!So what did I think of it (without giving major spoilers away): So at first I thought \"Oh no, not that banning music plot again like in Ariel's Beginning and the hero shows he's right\". However, I was amazed at how unlike that prequel the reason is very understandable and relatable. They don't just throw it in for a dumb reason, they back it up with a legit conflict and misunderstanding. Also all the characters are great, even the one that looked like a dumb comedic sidekick ends up being a lot more than I anticipated. Even the main character is not made to be an all perfect kid, he's being a legit kid; naive, eager, fast, and found his calling in the wrong direction ultimately leading him the right way. Even the villain's really good. He's no Frollo, but good grief, even though I got spoiled on who it was I was not prepared for how incredibly despicable he was! I hated him, and not in a way that I could like him! And of course the animation's terrific! That had to be some of Pixar's most difficult work, especially on the dead characters, Coco, and leaves. I read that this movie took 10 years to make and it really shows through the writing, animation, music, and even trying to capture the culture. I've never heard of a Disney film where there's actual research on a culture, or at least enough to take all the time they did to actually attempt to get it right (or at least I hope so - did they get it right?). And for the record, I didn't quiet cry, but certainly I was welling up with tears, I just held them back from falling. I probably would have cried harder if the ending was different, but I'm thankful it wasn't!!!!!So I don't know if it's my all time favorite Pixar movie (which is still Inside Out) but it's right \"Up\" there with it as one of Pixar's greatest achievements. Round of applause for you and you definitely earned that Oscar!Final Verdict: Go see it 10/10!", "Literally the only movie that has ever made me cry.

It was such an emotional journey for me, as I ended up crying my heart out. You know how it goes. It started with a couple of small tear beads, and before I knew it, I turned into one big deluge of sobs, streams of salty rivers gushing uncontrollably from my eyes. All those feelings that had been bottled up had to surface at one point, I guess, and Coco was a perfect trigger for that. I am so grateful, though, to have such an amazing boyfriend who I love so much and who held me tight in his arms and who understood perfectly what I was going through, without the need to utter a single word. It was the anguish of grief over my mum, now just a lingering memory of my dreams, and the fact that I also miss my dad, who is alive, but with whom I don't have the best father-son relationship.

Actually it is important for children to think about the world after death and realize what's important in their life.

I think that it was a delightful movie. Some family reunions in the movie will make you want to cry. \"Coco\" also has some scenes that will make you laugh your pants off. .The movie is about following your dreams but also remembering about your family. I think that the actors and actresses act just like their characters. They talk like how their characters would and reacted how they would react to something. I think that the whole cast of \"Coco\" did a great job. It really is an excellent movie to watch with your whole family\"Coco\" was released on November 22, 2017. The movie took place in Mexico on the Day of the Dead, October 31. The main characters are Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez), Mam\u00e1 Coco (Ana Ofelia Murgu\u00eda), Hector (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), Mam\u00e1 Imelda (Alanna Ubach), and Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt).\"Coco\" is about a young boy, Miguel, who wants to follow his dream of becoming a musician. Miguel's family hates music, but that is the only thing that makes him happy. His idol is Ernesto De La Cruz. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel finds out that there is going to be a talent show and he wants to sing and play the guitar. However, he didn't have his own instrument. He asks everyone to borrow their guitar, but no one lets him. Then, Miguel remembers that there is a church dedicated to Ernesto De La Cruz in the middle of the cemetery. In the church are his coffin and guitar. Miguel breaks one of the glass windows and gets inside. He gets the guitar and plays the strings. All the people outside of the church finds out that the guitar got stolen. When Miguel tries to apologize to a guard that came inside the church, the guard passes right through him. Miguel finds out that he turned into a ghost. He exits the church and enters the Land of the Dead. Miguel finds his dead ancestors that are now skeletons. His ancestors find and take him to Mama Imelda to get his blessing before morning. If he doesn't, then he'll become a skeleton just like his ancestors and live in the Land of the Dead forever. He gets his blessing by Mama Imelda but doesn't follow all of her conditions which sends him back to the Land of the Dead. Miguel wants to get a blessing by his idol. He wants to find Ernesto De La Cruz to get his blessing and find out why his family hates music before it's too late.I liked that \"Coco\" shows and talks about different traditions to the next level. At the beginning of the movie, the houses were all decorated with Papel Picados, Marigolds, lots of fruits, and pictures of their past away ancestors. I think that the moral of the story is about thinking about your family before following your dream.I'm assuming that other people who watch \"Coco\" will learn the same moral as I did.I would recommend this movie to those who like fantasies and mysteries. Though, I would not recommend it to like realistic films and to those who skip the movie/shows to the end to reveal the secret. If you don't like musical movies than you wouldn't want to watch \"Coco,\" either. The MPAA rating of \"Coco\" is a PG meaning that any age of children can watch it, but parents are advised to watch with the younger kids. My final rating for \"Coco\" is 5/5 stars.", "Coco is one of the best pixar movies that have been made in recent times. I've only watched a couple of pixar films from the 2010s, but Coco has the most heart I've seen. I felt more attached to the characters in this film than I did with the characters in Finding Dory. I've teared up watching other pixar movies like 'Up' and 'Toy Story 3' and this one was no different. I loved the character change in many of the characters like Miguel and the great-great grandmother. The plot twist was also executed well as I suspected Miguel's grandfather to be Ernesto de la Cruz due to all the hints so it was an excellent misdirection.Overall, a film with the great theme of pursuing your dreams but not to abandon your family and friends for that. 10/10", "This has to one of the best Pixar movies ever. Lately Pixar didn't have the best releases with an almost forgotten The Good Dinosaur ,lazy sequals of Cars which no one wanted. And a total abomination called Inside Out.

Directed by Lee Unkrich and co-director Adrian Molina, Coco draws heavily on Mexican folklore and the importance of family and tradition. Being a Pixar film, Coco appeals toward emotionally compelling moments, focusing on the power of love and family that never fails to make the audience cry. The young boy, Miguel Rivera, voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, takes us all on an exciting adventure that one can only imagine. Coco is a heartwarming family entertainer about the importance of family and a well-crafted coming of age story that also captures the beautiful traditions of Mexico. If you are looking for a story of family and legacy expressed through the storytelling and song of Mexican tradition, be sure to watch Disney Pixar's animated film Coco. In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, twelve-year old Miguel lives with his whole family. Miguel is a kindhearted child who loves music and idolizes once famous singer-songwriter, Ernesto de la Cruz. He dreams of becoming a musician against his family's wishes because his great-great-grandmother Imelda banned music in the family ever since her husband left her and their daughter, Coco, to pursue his music career. The movie takes place on El D\u00eda de los Muertos (the sacred Day of the Dead), an annual tradition in which the souls of the dead are able to return for a reunion with their living family members. It all starts when Miguel accidentally removes the photo sitting in the center of the family ofrenda of Coco with her parents and discovers that her father, Miguel's great-great-grandfather, whose face was torn out, was holding the famous Ernesto's guitar. Believing that his great-great-grandfather was indeed Ernesto de la Cruz and desperate to show his musical talent, he heads out to enter a talent show that was going on. Realizing that he needs a guitar, he sneaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and \"borrows\" the famous guitar to use in the talent show. All of a sudden he becomes invisible to the living and discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead. Miguel then finds himself in the Land of the Dead and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead. However, in order to return he must receive a blessing from a member of his family that can undo the curse placed upon him, so he seeks Ernesto for a blessing. Following a mysterious and exciting chain of events he encounters Hector, a skeleton who once played in a band with Ernesto, who offers to help him find him. In return, Hector asks Miguel to take his photo back to the Land of the Living to be put on the ofrenda, so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him and he disappears completely. The two go on a wild adventure to seek Ernesto and dark history is unfolded leading Miguel to figure out that Hector is actually his great-great-grandfather, not Ernesto. The film concludes with Imelda giving Miguel a blessing, with no conditions attached, so he can return to the Land of the Living. He sparks Coco's memory of Hector and she gives him a picture to place on the ofrenda. The final scene takes place one year later with Hector's picture happily back on the family ofrenda allowing him to return and reunite with Coco and the rest of his family. Beyond the main plot points, there are many other aspects that make this movie such a great one. One of the most interesting things about this movie is the way that its plot is built around the members of Miguel's family, living and dead. While exploring the Land of the Dead, Miguel is also able to experience and participate in the activities and traditions of Mexico which allows the audience to experience it as well. Some of the individual elements, such as the portrayal of the Day of the Dead, are very accurate and recognizable to those familiar with the tradition. Coco is filled with vibrant visuals and beautifully designed characters with stunning imagery like the bridge of yellow and orange petals that connects the two worlds. Accompanied by Oscar award winning \"Remember Me\" for best original song by songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez it captures the audience's imagination with humor and heartwarming moments. Lastly, the messages in the movie are powerful and beautiful and relates to both children and adults for everyone to enjoy. Coco is one of the most loved movies in America today as it focuses on the importance of family and the power of Mexican tradition and music which has never been seen before in a Disney-Pixar movie and I highly recommend it.", "Love and respect for family and ancestors is slowly eroding in modern society in the USA. I was deeply moved by this lovely story of our neighbors to the South. Whether it represents reality or not, it nevertheless teaches a fundamentally valuable lesson: That love for family is paramount and indespensible. Would that we all took this lesson to heart, or even more fully. Bravo to the writers, directors, animators, and actors.

Playing the first notes of Miguel preparing for the Day of the Dead with his family, the directors give the CGI a rich pastel appearance, highlighting the earthy, family connections the event celebrates. Crossing over to the Land of the Dead, the directors show a stunning advancement in CGI with gliding shots along the glittering Land and detailed character designs bringing emotions out of the skinless figures.Whilst the strings are made of the traditional Disney message of family being important, the writers find new melodies, with the use of songs spanning generations of families laying the dimensions of each character, from Miguel learning that family is part of the tapestry of his life,to H\u00e9ctor looking back at everyone he ran away from. Getting Miguel changed after showing his singing talents, Anthony Gonzalez gives a splendid performance as the lively Miguel, whilst Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal's gives a smooth melancholy to Hector's fears of being forgotten by Coco.", "It is such a heart touching movie and was kinda relatable, I was truly moved after watching it, the story was great\nDefinitely recommend !1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "The message in the film is beautiful:\nThe overall message in the film is one that relates to both children and adults.

The Land of the Dead, the setting for a large portion of the film, is an interpretation of traditional Mexican beliefs that are realised in the film alongside a deliberate avoidance of any religious connotations or messages. The dog - a Xoloitzcuintli, native animals to Mesoamerica historically believed to guide dead souls to the underworld - is named Dante in reference to the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, whom travelled through the underworld and returned in his epic, 'The Divine Comedy', ultimately to the same objective as Miguel in informing the living of the greater truth that they have learnt in their travels. As much as Dante's Divine Comedy is structured around the religious values that shaped medieval understandings of the world, 'Coco' is about family, and its messages are equally about the bringing about of a more socially unified world. Especially in the current climate where social division has been prevailing more than ever in recent times, commonly reflected through the sentiment pervading border control policies, 'Coco' provides a vision of all the good that perhaps we have been forgetting, and a landscape where border control is not about division but about bringing families together.", "I had never seen this movie in theaters due to lack of interest, but after discovering it on Netflix a couple days ago, my curiosity was immediately peeked, and I decided to give it a chance and watch it. I have absolutely no words. \"Coco\" is, without any doubt, whatsoever, a masterpiece of a film and the best one Disney and Pixar's made in decades.The characters are the most sympathetic fictional beings you will ever see on screen; especially H\u00e9ctor. You are gonna fall in love with all of these characters. The songs, animation, voice acting, morals and writing are brilliant. Seriously, this movie has everything an animated movie SHOULD have; Characters with immense likability, through and through, moving, catchy and emotional songs, the list goes on. Not only does \"Coco\" have things children will enjoy, but it has material adults will love, as well.I could put up many reasons why I think you should see this movie, but be warned; It is bound to make you cry, at points, including a certain plot twist and ending, which I refuse to spoil. After I watched it a couple times, it instantly made me bawl like a baby. I have a very sensitive heart, and this movie ripped it out and showed it to me, full throttle. The plot is handled with such care and love, you won't be able to stop watching. Once the film becomes an emotional and bittersweet rollercoaster ride, and my goodness gracious, does it ever, you feel a sense of peace and happiness shortly afterwards. I thought \"Fluke,\" \"Titanic\" and \"Finding Nemo\" were the only movies to make me cry buckets of tears, but \"Coco\" managed to break that scale.Without question, \"Coco\" is arguably the greatest Disney movie I ever watched. I've grown up with Disney, all my life and this should be up there with \"Pinocchio\" and \"The Lion King\" as their crowning achievement. I have nothing more to say in this review, but the following; I advise anyone who hasn't seen this movie before to watch it. Trust me, it is totally and completely worth it.", "So, all I know about Dias De Los Muertos is from Spanish class in high school, but from what I know, this movie was an imaginative and beautiful story using the Mexican culture in a positive and worthwhile way. I was actually enthralled and enjoyed every minute (and at 27, that says something). I think it's an excellent opportunity to expose kids to another culture, and look forward to having kids so I have an excuse to watch it again.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "When I saw the previews of the movie, I became interested at the concept of a Pixar film exploring the Mexican culture and Dia de Muertos (AKA The Day of the Dead) and to my surprise back at late 2017, it lived up to my expectations and became one of the best films of that year (including Dunkirk, Wonder Woman, War for the Planet of the Apes, etc.) Sure, it has a clich\u00e9 about music being forbidden (nothing negative to say about it), but once we got to the Land of the Dead, the rest of the film got a whole lot better.Not only does it have a great plot full of heart and emotion that explores the themes of culture, family, life, and death brilliantly, but the characters motivations made them believable most notably Miguel and Hector. Also, there is a plot twist which I'm not going to spoil to those who haven't seen the film yet. The pacing is really good, the directing is really strong, Michael Giacchino's score is brilliant thanks to it being authentic to the setting the movie takes place, and last but not least the animation. Not only from the expressive character designs on the humans and skeletons on the Land of the Dead, but the visuals themselves which are just as gorgeous as Brave's Scottish setting.I've found myself another favorite Pixar film (heck it's also my favorite CGI animated movie). It's just as good as the Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and Inside Out. This deserves a LordoftheFuture seal of approval. Recommended! :)", "Disney Pixar. I must say its one of there best movies i've seen in the past few years. Great story, at first i was a bit worried about how the skulls and skeletons would look in such a movie. I must say, they did great and i immediately fell in love with the characters. The movie makes you feel you are really in it and ofcourse the end is always a happy end.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Wow, what a movie!Coco tells a tale about a family who doesn't involve in music, not even remotely.\nBut a stubborn finds a way to achieve his dream and then unexpectedly story starting to hold the grip.With all the vibrant visuals, music, drama, emotions, humor & most important storyline this Pixar's beautifully animated movie is a must watch.

The cultural piece I want to focus on the most is the depiction of El Dia de Los Muertos more specifically how accurate their traditions were in the movie and see if they accurately celebrated the famous Spanish holiday. One of the most important traditions of El Dia de Los Muertos is the offering table, every family has their own offering table where everything on it serves as a symbol for something else(Avila, Lisa. \"A Day To Remember Family.\" A Day To Remember Family, 5 Nov. 2011, pp. 1-1.Elibrary.). This held true in Coco where on Miguel's offering table he had old shoes of his shoemaking ancestors and some of their favorite meals and snacks all offering as a symbol of something they liked or did in their past life. Another common thing to do on El Dia de Los Muertos is to visit the graveyard for a big party. Families bring a huge feast to eat while they clean tombstones, sing songs, and talk to their ancestors(Kelleher, Elizabeth. \"Day of the Dead.\" Kids' Games, Animals, Photos, Stories, and More, National Geograohic Kids, 28 Sept. 2016, kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/celebrations/day-of-the-dead) . Even though we did not see Miguel's family celebrating at the graveyard it is clear other families took to the graveyard to celebrate as we could see after Miguel got cursed into the afterlife. Overall Coco Is a culturally accurate and entertaining movie and I would definitely recommend watching it.", "The accurate and well depicted movie Coco is historically correct in their way of showing Dia de los Muertos. It shows how certain factors are portrayed in real life and in the film remain the same in every family like having ofrendas.What is included on the ofrendas is the part that changes from family to family. \nCoco had a good representation of the ofrendas because of how they used the yellow marigold flowers leading their loved ones from their graves back to their home. They also had some of the dead relatives favorite things like favorite food, drink, and even piece of clothing, are put on these altars. Other families eat the favorite food instead of placing it on the altars for the dead. In the movie, Dante eats food off of the ofrenda and Miguel yells at him saying it is for their ancestors not him. According to Lara Medina, \"The cempas\u00fachil (marigold flower), with its bright color and strong sent, leads the dead to the altars. Candies, incense, photos, food and drink that the dead enjoyed while living enhance the offering\" (176-177). This quote helps show the historical value or the relationship between what happens during Dia de los Muertos and how it is almost the same as it is in Coco. The quote explains how they use specific items in their lives to help make the home or the altar feel more like a family display of memories. In the movie, they have the skull candy heads on the altars, they have the marigold flowers leading from the graves back to their home, and they have pictures of every dead ancestor represented on the ofrenda. \nAnother example from Coco is how Miguel's grandmother, Coco's daughter, makes a huge deal about how the ofrenda has to look and be presented. She feels this way because it is the first thing the family sees when walking into the room because it is so extravagant with so many colors, and items on display. It is also again, how their past family is remembered and what was important to them in life to show their support and their gratitude for them being apart of their family. The ofrenda also helps remember what generations passed down through the family. In Miguel's family, it is the shoe business. His family is very driven to make sure he doesn't become a musician, and by doing that they pressure him or show him he is a shoemaker at heart. Medina writes, \"For the Mexica, during the last three days of the tenth month, the dead came back to interact symbolically with their families\" (176-177). This quote helps support the idea of family heritage represented on the ofrenda in Coco because if Miguel's ancestors came back and saw a guitar on the ofrenda instead of shoes, there would be trouble and no one in the family would be happy for the change in tradition. It also helps explain how the dead watches over the living through the ofrenda, through their pictures, through the memories of their families.\nIncorporating the aspect of the dead and the living joining together during this festive holiday is shown throughout the film, but is shown the most at the end. When Miguel can finally play the guitar in front of his family and all of his ancestors are dancing around him and enjoying their presence. A piece of evidence edited by J. Gordon Melton states, \"In Mexican culture it includes a belief in the unity of death and life\" (382). This evidence is shown in the film because it talks about the belief of death and life coming together to celebrate this holiday as one. In Coco when the dead travels over the marigold bridge to see their family, they can only pass if their family has something of theirs presented on the ofrenda. If not, they cannot visit. This relates to the quote because the dead want to be able to visit their family and be united with them for one day but, the family has to want them to visit in return. Like Hector and how the family did not want him to be able to come see his family and to see Coco again. \nOverall, in regards to Dia de los Muertos and Coco, the movie was very descriptive and historically accurate. It gave or showed in depth thought to how they represented the ofrendas and how it is important to the basis of the holiday. It shows how the ofrenda is where the holiday's heart or core is because without the ofrenda, the family members cannot visit or come back to see family.", "Day of the Dead is a holiday based on remembrance of loved ones. During this holiday people put up photos on their ofrendas, light candles, and celebrate life while honoring the dead. The movie Coco represents Day of the Dead and the Latino/a culture accurately. I don't believe that it undermines the culture in any way, shape, or form.\nIn the movie, Coco Miguel steals from one of his family members. He soon ends up in the spirit world. During this holiday family members are supposed to give to the dead and they have to put their photos on the ofrenda. The legend is that when they do this the spirits can cross over from the spirit world to the living world. When they get to the real world they celebrate with their family members and have the time of their lives. According to a 2007 Business news article, \"The souls of deceased loved ones come back on El Dia de Los Muertos and mingle among us.\"(McClatchy) This evidence shows us how much the movie actually relates to Day of the Dead and tells a story about it. Not many movies about different cultures truly represent the culture, as well as Coco has.\nIn the movie, his great-grandfather cannot cross over the bridge to the other world because he does not have a picture in his ofrenda. Having a picture on your family's ofrenda means more than people actually think. According to TCA Regional news, \"Gifts, keepsakes, and food--things that the departed enjoyed--generally are placed at the altar.- The traditional belief is that these offerings, or ofrendas, will coax the dead to visit the living.\"(Jones) I believe the movie didn't show this as well as it should have. In the movie, it seemed like the dead only wanted to spend time with their family and the things that they placed on the altar didn't lure them out of the darkness instead it was the life of their family. I believe that the movie should have shown this side just as much as seeing their family.\nMany people undermine this holiday they think it's creepy how people want to remember the dead. This holiday is more than honoring the dead it's a vibrant cultural tradition to celebrate the life that we have. We should always enjoy the little things and look to the future instead of dwelling in the past. These family members and friends should be remembered as best they can by living your life and not being sad that these people have passed. According to Antiques and collecting magazine, \"Day of the Dead is, despite its name-a vibrant celebration of life,\"(Trecker) I feel like this movie portrayed this very very well. It may have been a sad story but it showed us that even though this holiday is about recreating memories of loved ones and remembering who has passed, it's really more a celebration with your family. It's also about all the great things they did in their life.\nThis movie is one of my favorites and part of that is by how much I actually learned about the culture. It doesn't show any false representations about Day of the Dead instead they figured out a way to make it more entertaining. It did not undermine the Latino/a culture instead it made people understand the culture more accurately. Coco is one of the best cinematic representations of Day of the Dead.", "I spotted Coco while browsing and tbh I didn't expect it to be so good, it stole my heart with its dia de muertos characters and heartfelt warmth of family, struggle for your dreams and the coming together of the two, while staying true to Mexican culture and tradition (of which I respect) it'll make you cry and if you don't cry then you're a stone cold-hearted critter :P1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I and my friends like movies .movies is a good and very fun", "This movie is deeply moving.

I love the sequence of Helen getting stuck in all the doors. It's brilliant comedy and taking advantage of the sticky situations someone who can stretch can find herself in. I'm kind of astonished at the dark/adult content this movie deals with. Suicide? dead family? Playing getting sucked into a jet engine for laughs? Not to mention one of the most grisly Disney deaths I can think of (Others to me would be Bugs Life and Tarzan). That scene of the jet getting blown up always gets me emotionally. It's super tense and you understand both Helen and Violet's viewpoint of asking Violet to put a force-field around the plane. You're pulling for Violet and yet feel the frustration and fear of Helen. It's edited so well. Ug! I'm gushing. It's also refreshing to see a full family in a family movie. Disney has a lot of broken/single-parents and I get it. It saves money to not have siblings or two parents. it's less complicated. it makes kids like that feel better. But it's so nice to see a movie about family and about what they can accomplish together and show what a family can be. It's really encouraging. One of Pixar's best.

There are inhumane plans to prevent their passage in the territory of the United States as it is to build a famous border wall and among many other things. Therefore, having a large American company import a film of protagonists and Mexican history can have a great impact on American society. These companies are Disney and Pixar that have marked the lives of many children and young people for several years. Accompanying this, the purpose of children's films, in addition to entertaining children, is to promote values and carry a deep and real message that maybe the child does not understand at the moment but that parent or manager who accompanies him to watch the movies understands it and in some way, it moves him. Therefore, most of the time the movies educates both; the infant and adult. Mentioning that, I can say I liked the film because, besides being created by an American company that accepts these people, the American population has the opportunity to learn more about the Mexican culture an realize that we all go through similar adversities... we are all humans.The titled movie \"Coco\" reports the story of a Mexican child who wanted to be a musician, but because of family tradition it was prohibited to be a musician. Therefore, the child decides to play his guitar in a talent contest undercover of its relatives to demonstrate to the world the great musician he was. For his luck, the day of the contest was the same day of the Day of the Dead and he had to spend the whole day along with his family to celebrate it. While they all were in the cemetery remembering their family, the child decides to escape to find an instrument to play in the contest so he decides to steal a guitar from one of the biggest musicians and most successful one of the Mexican history who had already died. At the moment of stealing it from him, he appears in the world of the dead persons and he can only escape with the blessing of a relative and accepting the requisites that the relative proposes to him. After accepting, it begins the passage of the boy to look for a relative who offers him its blessing along with the permission of being able to become a musician.The story of the same one is a quite structured one although it is not one that is organized in a chronological order. It starts by reporting the past of the family and why they decide to hate any one that was a musician. It continues with the present of the child and its passage of going so far as to turn in musician and inside its passage there appear many flashbacks that fit with the reasons of hate towards the musicians from his family. The characters did not turn aside of its role and with this I refer to that it is possible to identify that it is a person of Mexican culture. For example, there are movies that the original role of the protagonist it supposes to be Latin, Korean, Japanese, European, etc. ... depending on the story, and the producers usually choose persons who do not qualify with the role of the protagonist and somehow part of the plot gets lost because it does not fit with the person. The viewer already has an idea of how it is supposed to be the protagonist and ends up being completely different from the one whom you were imagining to be the ideal. But in this case the protagonist sticks to its role.The composition of the music for the movie was an exquisite one that made you want to sing mariachi music until you lost your voice. With the music the viewer could feel so many emotions by the passion the protagonist was dedicating to each song. Although it is a cartoon movie, the viewer feels, cries, laughs and gets angry because behind every character there is a real story. Also, all the songs that were listened in the movie were mariachi songs, typical genre of Mexico, and each one was keeping a message that was going as regards to the story of the movie, from the freedom up to the memory.On the other hand, the scenery was fascinating because you could appreciate every detail for more minimal that it was. For example, the scenery of the World of the Dead persons was one that was consisting of 20 scenes that were creating only one image making the background one full of specific details to achieve a general image. The animation and texture of the background was excellent, whenever a character was moving from one place to another it was as if it really was leaving a mark in the space that he was treading. For example, the details in the character, both the hair and the clothes, seemed to be real.It is a movie that I fully recommend because it is full of surprises. When you were thinking that it already had the concluded movie, it surprised you with other things different from those that you had already raised. For this reason, the movie does not bore the viewer because every time something happened you will want to know what would actually happen or what that situation will become. I recommend, if you understand the Spanish language, to see it in Spanish because it makes you feel familiarly with the Mexicans. Since it is known, the Spanish language is the one that prevails in Mexico and to listen to mariachi music in English, for me, it would be quite strange and this Mexican flavor would get lost. Nevertheless, if you do not understand Spanish I suppose that the message will be delivered no matter what. Also, I recommend you to be prepared with towels to see the movie because you will cry from beginning to end.", "Wow what a great movie.

It was AWESOME!!", "Coco is about a family that was defined by a moment in their history. \nWe follow Miguel, a young boy who aspires to be something that his family is against.\nThis movie was directed by Lee Unkrich and is a original movie presented by Disney and developed by Pixar, this means that you can expect great animation, music and at least decent writing. Lee Unkrich has co-directed a lot of Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Monsters, Inc (2001), neither of them perfected but deservedly have the pronoun of classics. Other than being co-director, he also directed Toy Story 3 (2010), which in my opinion is a bit underwhelming, I would never call it a bad movie, because it has the same production quality as the other Toy Story movies, but I believe it has a lot of problems in its script and story, not gonna delve to deep about, just have in mind that I didn't love it, and would consider it a decent movie, not good.\nCoco follows a lot of plot lines and ideas from other movies, but I wouldn't consider it a down for this movie in terms of quality, just makes it less original and more of a retread of another movies like The Book of Life (2014). Unfortunately this isn't the big problem of Coco.\nThe big problem of Coco it's mediocrity when it comes to the script and the finality of the ideas, not only it is incredibly obvious where the story goes, it also does unnecessary plot twists that are obvious and lack of sense, which I won't spoil for obvious reasons, and because of this the emotional scenes are less effective at least when it comes to the story, because the score is so effective and well made, most people melt and forget the inconsistencies of the story, which didn't work for me, mostly because I am not a target audience of this movie, being in my twenties and having no children.\nOther problem I had is that the story had a big potential which fell through, by going through obvious and overdone paths, basically it decided to end as a perfect knot instead of a little more realist. With this point I meant to show why I didn't think the story and script are tight and perfect.\nOther than this problems it follows the great productions of other Pixar/Disney collaborations, having great music and animation with little and complex details, so I would recommend this movie as a fun movie for the whole family, but don't expect, at least if you are like me, a masterpiece.\nI would rate it a 6-7/10.", "Beautifully animated and entertaining but not as great as everyone is making it be. There were some beautiful songs and the voice acting was also pretty good but the concept or the execution was nothing new.

I loved nearly all of their films, except for Cars 3 and Brave (I actually thought Cars 2 was fine - don't hate me!). I am usually very open to most films and give them positive ratings despite a few flaws.With Coco, I was utterly disappointed. I was lucky enough to snag a few preview screening tickets last Friday. I went with my wife and 8 year old child. My son really liked it, but that was mostly because of the outstanding animation (some of Pixar's best animation yet) and the lead character. My wife and I both found the same flaws in this.The story is very different from what Pixar usually makes. Coco is not as childish or simple as most of their other works. The concept is guaranteed to teach children about a new culture that they might not know about. While this may sound like a huge positive, it completely ruins the film for adults who cared about the story. Almost every major plot point relies on the viewer understanding a certain amount of Spanish to know what is being said among the characters. Unfortunately, I took 4 years of French in high school and had absolutely no understanding of the Spanish language. I was confused as to exactly what was being said during the climax. A character mentions to another character some important detail about the story in Spanish (which I will avoid spoiling for you) that I had to infer for myself in order to keep up with the heavy story. I don't know if there were originally subtitles to the film or not, but my theater at least had no subtitles for English speakers.From the trailer, this film appears to be more mature and daring than a typical Pixar film. In reality, this movie is just more confusing and goes for visually stunning shots more often than it goes for emotion. This is still a good movie for kids - as opposed to a movie like The Emoji Movie - and has a few teachable moments. There is a nice and thoughtful message in this, but no real impact or emotional weight to carry it through to viewers. Think of this film as an African proverb - it offers an important life lesson, but no emotion or story to accompany it.In the end, I can't really recommend this film unless you are willing to sacrifice your standards of an engaging story and emotional impact for stunning visuals and an original concept from what used to be my favorite animation studio of all time.", "Nothing new, nothing special.The animation's very polished but even that is average at this point in hollywood.Music is a very standard Disney composition copy and pasted throughout the movie.Not a bad movie; just nothing you haven't seen a billion times before.11 out of 32 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I could not force myself to go on watching so could not finnish this!\nThe story is so mundane and the message of S\"Seize the moment\" is repeated so many times I could not continue...

This movie is overrated and clich\u00e9. Here's why. First of all, the movie uses a typical American Hollywood formula. Introduction character, introduction problem, introduction second character / sidekick, problem solving seems to be getting progress, plot twist, opposition (bad guy or whatever) gets the upper hand, main charecter saves the day and then the movie ends. \nThis doesn't necessarily have to be a problem but this movie basically felt like two long cartoon episodes stuck together. In the past there are several TV show episodes where someone gets stuck in the realm of the dead on the Mexican holiday dia los muertos. One can ask how original it still is. You combine that with characters that aren't too interesting - it even has the typical seemingly useless animal sidekick that plays a minor role - and a plot that's predictable and one can understand why I can't possibly consider this movie to be a classic. \nDon't get me wrong though. I still enjoyed this movie somewhat, although that was mainly because it's of its highly polished animation and the presence of a good 'vibe'. The music definitely helped with that.Summary:Not original story;Typical movie formula;A bit predicatable;+ Highly polished animation;\n+ Good vibe.", "All I have to say is the music was dreadfully out of tune, the concept is pretty new although ridiculous about a kid running away from the land of the living to meet up with his great ancestor who was a beloved musician.

I was so unpleased with the unsatisfying taste I still have in my mouth from watching this. All I can say is I do like the color scheme this movie was showing off but altogether visuals aren't everything, you have to have a likable cast and somebody who can actually sing to back it up, this film has neither.

All it has going of it is nice animation and a story focusing on The Day Of The Dead. Take that away and what do you have?-A boring, cliched, predictable, formulaic, unoriginal story.-A terrible script.-Some overused and forgettable songs.-Some of the most boring and cringeworthy scenes that I've ever seen.-Cliched characters.-Some of the worst tropes you could possibly put into your movie unless you are planning on making it comedic (South Park did the \"villain rants on about plan onstage and they think only the protagonists hear them but a protagonist turns on a microphone so that everyone can hear them\" in S13 E1 \"The Ring\" back in 2009 and it was way more entertaining and nowhere near as cringeworthy as its done in this movie's painfully boring finale). I'm just using this scene as an example. Honestly EVERYTHING in this movie has been done better by something else before. It is painfully bland and unoriginal.This movie is so cliched and predictable and boring and uninspired and stupid that I can't recommend it. What child would stay awake during the runtime? What adult wouldn't get bored ten minutes in? I only watched it due to all the praise it got, and spent the whole runtime wondering where it was coming from.If this movie was more focused on The Day Of The Dead, and everyone's motives made more sense, then this movie would've been much better. The whole family hating music because of a musician leaving is a bit ridiculous, even though the movie tries to present it seriously. There is barely any tension because every time a character is in \"danger\" you know there is going to be some kind of ex machina that's going to show up and save them.Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you want to take a nap.", "I saw this movie at a special screening at Pixar Studios in Emeryville, CA. What an experience for the heart, mind and sou!We generally think of family films as those aimed at children, that happen to be enjoyable enough for adults. Coco, however, will be as much a hit in nursing homes as it'll be among grade-schoolers, who will laugh and cry in equal parts as the people at my screening did. It's about a family, a multi-generational family living together. I won't spoil anything, but I wish I'd been as good a great-grandson as the boy in this story.Here are my six takeaways from the morning after. I'm sure more will come to mind in the coming days and weeks, because it definitely deserves a second or third view:1. The story is probably the most rich, complex and well-written narrative I've seen in an animated film. It breaks into, and surpasses, some worthy live-action screenplays. Pixar should start campaigning for a Best Original Screenplay nomination in my opinion.2. The animation and production design are as expected, first-class. There are feast-for-your eyes visuals in the creation of imaginary places and characters, but what most impressed me was the everyday places and people, and how they filled them with cinematic wonder and color. Note: everyone I was with agreed that the detail of the titular character of Coco was unlike anything we've ever seen in animation.3. I'm a guitar player, and I can say with certainty that this is the first time I've seen animated characters correctly playing the instrument. Even in live-action movies this is not always the case, but in Coco it's obvious the filmmakers captured real guitarists playing note-for-note what you hear in the music.4. All the research and consulting into Mexican culture/sociology has paid off. To the rest of us the movie seems very respectful of family dynamics and the D\u00eda de los Muertos celebration. But the best proof lies in Mexico: since its release (which was one month before it appears everywhere else) it has become the highest-grossing movie in Mexican box-office history. After the screening I read that many of the minor characters were drawn as an homage to legendary Mexican entertainers.5. The filmmakers created a good balance between the characters' use of English and Spanish, as well as in the visuals (streets and shop signs, etc.). English-speaking audiences will understand the plot, while learning some vernacular in the process.6. Stay until the last credits roll! The filmmakers added a heartwarming segment at the very end. You'll be glad you stayed.Here in the US it's being released around Thanksgiving, and just like Saving Private Ryan made us respect The Greatest Generation, this movie will make you want to hug and kiss all your elders at the table.", "I was thrilled to see that Disney had finally released a high-profile film with a little boy as the protagonist, as their output of the last decade or more has been solely tailored to build the self-esteem of girls... evidently not realizing the two don't have to be mutually exclusive. My surprise and relief didn't last long. First, the addition of the 21-minute Frozen \"short\" was a strong indicator that they felt a \"boy movie\" would need to give some incentive to pull in their preferred audience. Then the film actually started...I know they mean well, but I wish there were just one person in the organization who would think for a moment about the message they send to boys. It's as though they've forgotten boys have eyes and ears, too. And their message is this: boys only matter as long as they're providing or protecting, and if they're not doing that, they're villains. In Wreck-It Ralph they went as far as suggesting suicide would be a noble way to save the little girl, and in Coco they made it clear that not even being murdered lifts those responsibilities. It's disturbing. It would have been so simple not to send this message with Coco... all they had to do was make Coco a boy. But they couldn't do that because no one is expected to sympathize with boys unless they're striving for someone else. And they hammered the point home by, at the very end, making sure we saw that the next generation of the family's children was also a girl, continuing the lineage of people that really matter, with Miguel no longer being useful. If they'd even just made that infant a boy in its brief appearance it would have mitigated the message somewhat. But they weren't prepared to do that. Disney was built on stories that had universal appeal. Is it not time to start taking Lassetter's Disney to task for what they're teaching today's children?", "I was very skeptical at first, as a Mexican I was afraid they'll use the stereotypes and put us in a box, but by the end of the movie I felt more Mexican than ever.Coco exploits one of the most important Mexican traditions in a very respectful way, it shows what D\u00eda de Muertos it's all about, the one night a year where we can reunite with our beloved ones that are no longer here.Pixar-Disney jumps out of the box, once again, and leave all the princess and fairy stories to show us the importance of family and traditions in a unique funny and colorful story. All the characters are right on point, they grow together learning from each other making it one of the most emotional and pleasing movie I've seen in a long time.A movie that will make you laugh and cry, Coco might be a movie for children but a guarantee everyone will just love it. Bravo!", "It amazes me how many people claim this to be ORIGINAL and FRESH. I really liked Guillermo Del Toro's BOOK OF LIFE. And this film steals the look, the musical style and even some of the character designs from that film. Just really disappointed. The worst part is no one notices. People are so self-absorbed and pre-occupied with other things that they have no attention spans. So BOOK OF LIFE was forgotten within a year. I even had some people tell me this was a sequel! Disney seems to be able to do anything they want these days and to say anything negative gets you censored or shut down. But a fact is a fact. And Pixar is much better than this.11 out of 34 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Oh I forgot, the Olaf mini movie was the Christmas movie this one was completely at the wrong time of year.So I will review it as though it was at the right time of the year and just get on with it.The visuals were outstanding, easily Oscar level.

He then seeks to release his real great great great grandpa.While the animation is good and the voice acting is too, the script just moves along with a bunch of plot devices to move the character along the road until the writer gets them to the conclusion. There is no real conflict. There is no struggle.

The research and development spent on this film all pays off with a vibrant story that combines the real world with spiritual world populated by those spirits that have passed on.With a stellar cast of voices by Benjamin Bratt, Gael Garcia Bernal, Alanna Ubach, Edward James Olmos, and newcomer Anthony Gonzales as the main protagonist Miguel, all providing flawless characterizations along with magnificent singing voices.With the very sure hand of directors, Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina we are transported to the very colorful and vibrant world of Mexican folklore, combining it with a modern aesthetic that is both appealing and mysterious. The Pixar artistry is at work here on such a high level that every frame dazzles us with amazing imagination!The music is such a treasure here, and sparks a range from traditional Mexican songs to the very touching and moving song \"Remember Me\" which serves as the vital core of the entire film.A great treat for both children and adults, \"Coco\" is a treasure that will live on with the greatest of the Pixar cannon.", "On the up side, the technical level of the animation is outstanding, and I suppose the tear-jerker ending is OK. But, IMHO, the down sides far outweigh the positives. The movie is incredibly long with one pointless scene after another, apparently designed to show off some flashy animation. And, when you cut thru all of that flashy animation, the story itself is actually pretty lame.I'd wager that the vast majority of the high reviews for this film are from kids who don't care that the story is trite in the extreme, and people who have some sense of cultural pride in seeing a movie set in Mexico that doesn't involve Clint Eastwood blasting a bunch of Mexican bad guys. If you are not in either of those groups, I suspect you'll be left scratching your head over the astronomically high rating of this long and boring movie.6 out of 17 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This is one of the best animated films I've seen in a long while.

Miguel is a nice little boy whose family, inexplicably, HATE music and insist he never can grow up to become a musician. And, wouldn't you know it, but that's EXACTLY what the boy wants to become one day.

Not surprisingly, this creates all sorts of problems...and Miguel is transported to the land of the dead. What's next?

A must-see film.", "Pixar's unique and colorful take on the Dia De Los Muertos was truly remarkable. The story was a match made in Pixar heaven due to its heart wrenching and heartwarming moments. Though this story seemed a bit morbid at times, you can really tell Pixar catered this movie to adults as well as kids. The visual effects were probably my favorite in any Pixar film thus far. The amount of detail on screen at any given time was beyond belief. Also, the character development was extraordinary. Having an extensive look at each character's background not only helped you fall in love with the characters, but it was also used as a unique storytelling device. The music in this movie was great too as it paid homage to the traditional mariachi style still practiced in Mexico today. The movie even featured some songs with lyrics entirely in Spanish. Overall, I would say this movie captured the Mexican heritage to a T. The characters were memorable, the story and dialogue were exceptionally written, the visuals were gorgeous and bursting with color, and the music was festive and fun.9 out of 30 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Pixar, aside from a few weak entries with either Cars 2 or Brave, has always been the studio that places quality entertainment over making a quick buck. Coco is their latest outing, and I'd be absolutely lying to everyone if I didn't say that I loved every second of my viewing experience with this film. Coco is easily one of their best in years and possibly one of their best, period. Diving into themes that felt very risqu\u00e9 for this particular studio, I found that these particular elements only added to the overall story as a whole. Here is why I believe Coco is the must-see movie this year and why it will probably bring tears to many.Due to a tragic past that I won't discuss here, young Miguel (the main protagonist of the film) is forbidden to ever take up music as a profession. Looking up to the great Ernesto de la Cruz, he hopes to be like him one day (the greatest musician to ever live). As he borrows Ernesto's guitar to perform in a contest during the Mexican day of the dead celebration, he is sucked into the land of the dead, where he meets his ancestors. Discovering new things about life, death, and the importance of family, Coco is a film that will send you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.Throughout the first act of this movie, you feel as though it will be a touching story about a boy who's able to connect with the family he was never able to have met, but the hidden secrets will shock even the smartest of viewers. I hope you'll be as shocked with some of the reveals as I was because the writers have really outdone themselves in terms of making you care for these characters. Yes, the plot itself may have familiar elements, but what film doesn't nowadays?I believe that Coco found a way to spin the clich\u00e9s on their head, injecting some very dark aspects into this movie, which I found to be quite the risk but also worth it in the end. There are times when adults will feel as though they're watching a mature film due to how certain circumstances play out, and while kids can still enjoy the spectacle of this movie, this really is a children's movie for adults. That being said, the spectacle of it all is still worth the price of admission alone.Disney/Pixar continues to impress its audience in terms of how detailed the majority of their films have become, and Coco is no exception. Not only was I sucked up in the emotional journey that Miguel goes through, but the visuals only added a level of depth to the story, due to the fact that the animators have really made these people feel realistic, not in a true-to-life way, but in the way they move or speak to one another. This film is everything you could possibly ask for from Pixar.In the end, Coco is the reason we go to the cinema. We want to be transported to a unique world that makes us forget about reality, but that also reminds us how important reality still is. The core essence of this film's existence is to remind everyone that even the biggest of dreams will have their issues and that family really is the most important thing in life. Whether or not you choose to buy into that aspect will probably make or break your enjoyment of the movie, but I was moved to tears by it. Pixar has created another masterpiece in Coco and this may just be the best film I've seen all year. I can't recommend this beautiful piece of filmmaking enough.", "I loved it, I felt very identified as Mexican with my traditions, it made me revalue the importance of celebrating this beautiful tradition that is the Day of the Dead and imagine how our ancestors can walk among us on this date. Great production by the Disney - Pixar duet. It's an action movie, there are multicolored characters, it has suspense and a great end. I will watch it again!!!", "First, it is one of the most inspired propaganda tools for Mexico. colors, music, characters, story, all is touching and beautiful and admirable. and that is a motif for I cried. because it is a magnificent eulogy of family. family in old fashion sense, with his past, rules, members from this and that world. a film of candies colors, lovely songs and a lot of adventures. and the title, yes, it is the mark defining everything. a film about love and about the importance of roots. splendid at whale.3 out of 7 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "An impeccable fusion of first-rate storytelling & jaw-dropping animation, Coco is an awe-inspiring, highly riveting & endlessly entertaining delight that's crafted with passion, precision & perseverance, and is practically flawless.

It is rich in cultural reference to Mexico that may be a bit strange to embrace to non-Latin Americans. The music in the movie is soft and emotional, but not epic, glorious or Oscar-grabbing. The major plot points are predictable. Most of these are not really complaints, just factors of potential viewing (dis)pleasure.Apart from these, the film blew me away. I had zero expectations walking in the theater with my kids, wasn't sure whether it's just another animated movie after first 30 minutes or so and definitely saw the result of Ernesto/Hector clash coming. It nevertheless grabbed my soul at that breaking point and never let go. It was only then that I truly started to care for our main characters and their family, but did so doubly.Coco is, for most part, seemingly a completely irrelevant character, until she becomes a focal point of everything. Of entire (mostly dead) family line. She is the key to love and forgiveness of their (deceased) parents, to a final wish of a missing father and to both Miguel and his family members (dead and alive), who come to finally understand that respect for family is just as important as respect for dreams of its individual members. And it is not just Miguel who ultimately suffered from Imelda's hate for Hector, it was also Coco. But her grief and own final wish were locked away in a catatonic body until Miguel came back from the dead to set that wish come true with a song, filled with love for family.I could not really claim this is the best film I have ever seen, but it was the one that immersed me into its story most and evoke my emotions.There were three times I've cried watching a movie in my life: - at the end of East of Eden when I was 7 - at the end of Color Purple when I was 15 - for the entire final third of Coco, now when I'm 40+.It will always have a special place in my heart. I will always Remember you.", "Review:\nI quite enjoyed this emotional animation movie, which really does have something for everyone but I must admit, I didn't really find it that funny. I know that it wasn't supposed to be that amusing but I missed the usual Pixar humour, which I have grown to love over the years. Don't get me wrong, the movie is certainly entertaining and the animation is truly remarkable but it's not the type of film that you can watch time and time again, like the earlier Pixar movies. With that aside, the attention to detail was great and the storyline was well written but I was still expecting more from this reputable company. Anyway, the movie is about a little boy, Miguel, who has a secret love of music, even though his family has banned it from there home. When he sees that there is going to be a local music competition, he escapes from home to show off his talents, but he is caught by another family member, who destroys his guitar. Failing to find another guitar to enter the competition, he decides to steal the guitar from the famous Ernesto de la Cruz mausoleum, who turns out to be his great-great-grandfather. Whilst stealing the guitar, Miguel becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza, and he enters the mysterious world of the Land of the Dead, were he meets his skeletal dead relatives. Miguel soon realises that he is cursed for trying to steal the guitar, and he can only return to the Land of the Living, if he is blessed by one of his relatives before sunrise. One of his relatives, Imelda, offers to give him a blessing but on the condition that he abandons his musical pursuits, which Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessings instead. Miguel then escapes from his family, to seek his great-great-grandfather but he's unable to get far because of his human looks. He then gets the help from Hector, who needs Miguels help to get his picture back to his daughter, so she doesn't forget him, so they go on there mysterious journey to find Ernesto, before Hector disappears, and Miguel gets banished to the Land of the Dead. It's quite an unusual but original storyline, which took 6 years to bring to the big screen, due to the importance of getting the authenticity of the project completely correct, and I'm sure that the animation took ages to perfect as well. I appreciate the work behind the scenes, that it takes to make a Pixar movie but I personally think that they have lost there touch since they have gone to Disney. That's not to say that this movie wasn't a great watch but there is too much competition out there at the moment. With movies like Ferdinand to compete with, Pixar need to up there game to claim back the top spot that they have owned for many years. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch, and I'm sure that people will shed a tear, and jump for joy whilst watching it but I personally was hoping for more in the humour department. Enjoyable!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Lee Unkrich, who brought you Toy Story 3, and co-directed Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo. He also produced The Good Dinosaur and Monsters University, so he has certainly earned his stripes with Pixar. After watching hours of bonus material, Unkrich and his team spent a lot of time in Mexico, with various families, to get the whole look and feel of this film spot on, and he done a terrific job in that department. The vibrant colours throughout the movie, along with the close family element, really did work well but I did find Ferdinand slightly more funny. It didn't actually hit the billion dollar mark but it was still a hit with filmgoers around the world, and I haven't heard a bad word said about it. With Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4 in the pipeline, I'm sure that Pixar will be smashing the box office this year but I personally think that Toy Story should have been left alone.Budget: $200million\nWorldwide Gross: $805millionGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy\nCast: Anthony Gonzalez, Gael Garcia Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Alanna Ubach, Renee Victor, Jaime Camil, Alfonso Arau, Edward James Olmos, Carla Medina, Cheech Marin, John Ratzenberger and Herbert Siguenza. 7/10", "No words.

His family disapproves of his musical interests, and all his time must be devoted to making shoes, although he has always been a good kid and just wants to follow his dreams. Miguel must make a tough decision when it comes down to his dreams and family. He finds himself in an extraordinary world like no other, and with the help of his fallen ancestors and role model, Ernesto de la Cruz, in the Land of the Dead, maybe he has a chance to end the banishment of music in his family once and for all...I hardly started in \"Coco\", and already I see the exceptional visual effects and soundtrack that sets this movie apart from any animated movie I have ever seen. This movie comes to show that animation is a medium, not an age category for little kids, therefore proving that it can be interesting to any age. The movie \"Coco\" makes for a very special viewing due to the beautiful message that reminds you to listen to your heart, follow your dreams, and above all put family first.I was in awe by \"Coco\" and what made me love it, even more, was how different, yet remarkable it was, than your traditional Spanish animated movies. When I began taking Spanish in the 7th grade, I remember watching the movie \"The Book of Life\" in class. I thought it was amazing. I was able to learn so much about The Day of the Dead, and the rituals that are practiced. Then I saw \"Coco\". It set \"The Book of Life\" apart by a far shot. \"The Book of Life\" showed us the meaning of true love, and finding your person despite all the obstacles you may face. That was the first thing that set it apart from \"Coco\". \"Coco\" not only shows how love conquers all, but it also showed the meaning of love within a family. Since I do know quite a bit about this special holiday, I am able to say that both films did a tremendous job capturing the idea of The Day of the Dead, and why it is so important in many Spanish speaking countries. As similar as these two movies are, I have never seen any movie quite like \"Coco\", when it comes to the message behind it all.Like I said before, one of the main attraction's of the film \"Coco\" is its astonishing visual effects. The two worlds in this movie are connected by beautiful orange marigold's. When the filmmakers had the idea for this movie, they did lots of research on The Day of the Dead and found out that families lay marigolds out on streets connecting all the way to their ofrenda (or alter) with pictures and memories of their loved ones. In connection to this holiday, marigolds are so important, because they help guide the spirit of a family's loved one home. The bright orange marigold bridge was brought to life through the latest animation technology, and it was an exquisite view for everyone. The inspiration for the Land of the Dead was the hilly Mexican town of Guanajuato, that had beautiful lights surrounding the town bringing it to life at night. The scene where we first see the Land of the Dead in \"Coco\" was shot with 7 million lights, giving it it's luminous colors and shapes that bring the whole story to life. The breathtaking animation makes this movie definitely worth seeing.Yet another main attraction of the movie, \"Coco\", is it's the euphonious soundtrack. This film features an original score from Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (the composer who wrote the songs from Disney's \"Up\"), a song by Oscar winners Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, and additional songs co-written by Germaine Franco and co-director and screenwriter Adrian Molina. Director Lee Unkrich said, \"Coco' has music in its DNA,\" which is why it features a variety of beautiful Mexican music. Franco explored a wide variety of instrumentation to write these songs, including a guitarron, folkloric harp, a Quijada, sousaphone, charcheta, yjaranas, requintos, marimba, trumpets, and violins. The traditional Mexican songs in this movie, bring the characters and town to life and inspire the main character Miguel to venture on a risky path towards being a musician. There was so much work put into all of the songs, including the hit song \"Remember Me\", which was written as both a lullaby and an upbeat song. The soundtrack leaves you blown away, and the creativity put into each song makes it even better.From this movie, 12-year-old Miguel learns the true meaning of family, and the sacrifices you have to make. The script has some inspirational quotes that melt your heart, and leave you wishing for more. One of the first times Miguel realizes the importance of family is towards the end of the movie when he says, \"We may have our differences, but nothing is more important than family.\" This quote is important to the storyline because Miguel realized that no matter your differences and your goals in life, you'll always have one thing in common, and that's the bond and love you share for each other. Although Miguel learns to cherish family, he also learns to follow his dreams, despite the obstacles he faces. Miguel realizes that he is different yet special, when he says, \"I am not like the rest of my family. There's something that makes me different.\" He realized that it is one thing to follow your dreams, but first, you have to believe in yourself enough to pursue them, which is something Miguel struggled with. Miguel, as well as other characters, teach you to always put family first, but to also accept who you are, and to never be afraid to follow your dreams no matter the circumstances.I could go on and on about this movie, but I'll stop there. To conclude, \"Coco\" is a vibrant story of family, fun, and adventure with remarkable characters, visual effects, and a soundtrack that gives the story liveliness. With crazy twists, and lifelong lessons, this movie is by far one of the best films to see, and I promise you when I say that it will truly melt your heart, because in the long run, being yourself matters more than you know.", "Disney gets another future classic with Coco depicting a touching family story in a charming way with a lot of fun and catchy tunes.

Lets face it, Disney / Pixar usually puts out decent movies, many are forgettable, but there are a handful that really stick with you and Coco makes that list. It doesn't matter what nationality you are, but I can see how it's really a home run for the Latino communityFirst off, great story! I'm not Latino, and growing up just assumed Halloween was your typical worldly holiday, which to me simply meant dressing up in costumes and getting free candy. I had no idea the significance or meaning it had for Mexico & Latin America countries and it took a Disney movie to educate this 40+ year old about this. But I'm certainly glad it did. But getting back to the story, it was original, fun, and with some good twists & turns.The Acting and songs were great, but the visuals were probably the best I can think of to date. I remember when I first saw Finding Nemo how stunned I was by the colors and visuals, but Coco takes that to a whole other level.

Disney and Pixar can be included in this conversation (more Disney though than Pixar, with movies like Pocahontas and Aladdin being some of the most controversial). Pixar, however, has remained relatively close to the cultural truth with Coco. Even though it still has its controversies (mainly regarding its plot originality), the movie makes for a colorful, entertaining spectacle of Mexican culture; specifically during the Day of the Dead, or Dia de los Muertos.Coco takes place during Dia de los Muertos, a colorful celebration of the passed on. This can make for an interesting setting for Pixar, and they worked very well with it. They present a story on the importance of dreams, family, and remembrance. The remembrance part is very prevalent (even its Oscar-winning song is named Remember Me), and it should be. In fact, Judy King states in her article on mexconnect.com that, \"On this night, those who wait realize the importance of living to be well remembered, working to be well respected and loving to be well missed\"(mexconnect.com). The struggle to be remembered leads people to create a legacy that they will be remembered by, or others tainting said legacy. In the story, Hector, Miguel's great-great grandfather, had been left forgotten because his family tainted his legacy by quite literally tearing him from his family after leaving them and never coming back. On the other hand, De La Cruz worked to create his own legacy by stealing songs and credit to become a well known and respected in Mexico. The need to be remembered is centered on the fact that the spirits of the dead need to return to our world during the Day of the Dead. However, if one were to be forgotten, the story portrays a \"final death\" where there is no one left to remember someone, and they fade away forever, even from the the realm of the dead. After being skeptical of this being portrayed as true (I had never heard of this idea before), I discovered that this is actually more or less the real idea. Victor Landa is quoted in Judy King's article on mexconnect.com as saying \"The third death, the most definitive death, is when there is no one left alive to remember us\" (mexconnect.com). This is why people work so hard to be remembered, so that no one ever forgets them, because of they fade from the memory of the living, they will surely disappear from any existence.One discrepancy that I found was the spirit guides. In Coco, they are mostly portrayed as colorful animal hybrids, such as winged dogs or cats. While they do fit in well with the mood and scenery of the movie, they do not portray the whole truth. They are most likely inspired by Colima Dogs, ceramic dog figures designed to help guide the dead in mesoamerican lore. Kristen Romey of National Geographic attests that \"The most frequent depictions take the form of small ceramic vessels known as Colima Dogs... which may have served as symbolic dog guides to help the soul of the dead travel through the Underworld\" (nationalgeographic.com). So, while the guides aren't all true, they do have basis in real world lore. In fact, a dog named Dante is commonly featured in the story as a \"connection\" between worlds, and even morphs into a spirit guide himself.In conclusion, while Coco, isn't 100% accurate to cultural truth, there is very little bending to it. Even the added elements have cultural basis to them, which helps them to blend seamlessly to the rest of the story, which has allowed the cultural elements of the Day of the Dead to guide an entertaining story that looks familiar to people who celebrate the holiday, and they have built off of many of the elements to create amazing environments and artistic storytelling.", "In Disney Pixar's movie, Coco one of the main cultural pieces that was represented was La Dia de los Muertos (day of the dead). The story in this movie took place on Dia de los Muertos which is normally on November 2nd in Mexico, but in America, the holiday starts on Wednesday, October 31st and ends on November 2nd. I believe that Coco had a great representation of this Hispanic holiday. According to Wikipedia.org, \"The multi-day holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their spiritual journey....traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ofrendas, honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.\" In the movie, the family had a very well represented ofrenda to honor their passed relatives. They set out food, candles and pictures of their relatives which is very accurate to a real Ofrenda. \nGoogle Arts and Culture states, \"It is a day to honor and commemorate the lives of the dearly departed and to welcome the return of their spirits\". This holiday is basically celebrating the lives of past relatives, but some homes believe the spirits come back to us and walk among us at night so they can see their family. In Coco, there was a bridge of leaves that allowed the deceased ancestors to walk into the living world and visit their family, but before then they had to go through a security checkpoint to make sure their picture was put up or else they would not be able to cross. Not all families believe the same thing but they're all around the same traditional holiday.\nAccording to Culturegrams Database on Mexican holidays, \"Each town also has an annual festival that includes a religious ceremony, meal, and dance. Many people try to return home for these events.\" This is describing how important and relevant holidays are in Mexico including Dia de los Muertos. In Coco, the town that Miguel and his family live in there was a huge festival going on celebrating this holiday. They even had a talent show where anyone could sign up and play music. \n I believe that Coco is very accurate to this holiday and traditions they represented in the film. The only aspect that is not one hundred percent correct in Coco was how the little boy went into the world where he could talk to the dead. Not because this isn't culturally accurate, but because it is just fiction. A lot of pieces in this movie were more about building a story in fiction mostly to catch the eye of the watchers. \nCoco was very accurate in cultural representation (despite the parts of building a story as I mentioned above), not only were so many aspects in the movie relatable to people of the hispanic culture, but they were also extremely enjoyable. Overall Coco is a great cultural introducing, family and heart touching movie.", "This is quite possibly one of the most gorgeous, touching, well-made films Pixar has ever released, and it is certainly my favorite since Tangled.

I raved about this movie for days after to anyone that would listen, and it took everything in my power not to spoil everything about it in my excitement.

So it doesn't come as a surprise that he delivers once again with 'Coco' which is beautiful and vibrant in every way. Co-director Adrian Molina also deserves a lot of credit of course as he also wrote some of the original songs for the movie.In fact every single person involved in creating this stellar animation deserves an abundance of credit as every aspect of the film is a pleasure to enjoy. Not only is it incredibly entertaining but it is emotionally resonant and introduces audiences who may not know much about Mexican culture to an authentic and heartwarming portrayal of it.'Coco' is about young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) who dreams of becoming a musician like his idol Ernesto de le Cruz however his family have banned music due to something terrible that happened a few generations ago. During Dia de los muertos, after a set of mysterious events, Miguel finds himself in the Land of the Dead. Once there, he meets trickster Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal) and together they go on an adventure to discover the real story behind Miguel's family history.The entire voice cast is fabulous and they handle the comedic moments in the film very well as their timing is perfect.

This movie was on the Oscar buzz list ever since it got released so I gave it a try since I loved the Toy Story trilogy and Finding Nemo which were also created by Unkrich if I'm not mistaken.Let me start by saying that I was starting to believe that in nowadays cinema there wasn't any more \"inspiration\" or creativity until I saw this movie. I'll admit it's like most of the animated pixar movies regarding the narative structure but the originality of the story cannot be neglected. This is probably the best movie of 2017 and even if it had only 105 minutes it felt like a three hour epic. That was because this movie was so rich and so many things happen that it hits you and stays with you long after it's over. This is probably the most mature movie I've seen from pixar ever. The story is very original and the set pieces are so authentic and it gives you the Mexican atmosphere so naturally and makes you basically teleport into this universe. And although I've said it above that this movie follows the same narative structure as most of pixar movies, it has a original story to tell and one that is mature, one that is full of message and ideas. For example the idea that everyone dies sometimes and all of us sooner or later will be forgotten or how important is to love your family and treasure those you have for the time you have them with you. I have an old grandma and while I was watching the end I had such a warm feeling of wanting to hug her and tell her I love her and that I'll miss her when she's gone but I always remember her. This is what a great movie does to the audience: it inspires them, it reminds them of things that we sometime bury due to our hurry in this life. I just can't find any superlatives for this movie. The voice acting is fantastic and the most impressive thing is that all the cast was spanish talking persons which had such an authentic feel in the overall movie. Then there's the score which is fantastic. I cannot understand how it didn't get nominated for Oscar since it replicates the traditional mexican style of music while also being a beautifull movie score. Props to Michael Giacchino who is one of my favorite composers alive. It's beyond me how this didn't get nominated for original score but the generic iconic music of star wars the last jedi by John Williams did. My only gripes with the movie might be that it somewhat slows down in the middle and some creature were kind of a unanswered mystery for me. Aside from that this movie is pretty much flawless and is one of my best movie experiences ever.In conclusion: fantastic movie with great story, amazing voice acting from a well chosen cast, great score and songs and superb animation. 10/10", "The story itself will warm your heart, but the imaginative rendering that brings together the world of the dead and the world of the living in Mexican culture for the setting of this tale will mesmerize you.

Towards the end I thought I finally got through a Disney Pixar movie with myheart unscathed, but I was wrong. Up has the best initial ten minutes, and now Coco has the best last ten minutes; both by pixar.\nGreat film, might be one of my favorites from Pixar after Toy Story series in terms of the amount of heart that was put into it, and the great human connection that it made us strengthen with our own family.\nAnd I was so glad that the main message was not another generic \"chase your dream\" but rather about family.\nIt was a beautiful movie with a giant heart. It's a really, really sweet movie, and the story is one of Pixar's strongest in years.\nMy favorite is Dante, he wasn't an annoying animal sidekick, he actually helped drive the story.\nI really wish that Coco will win the Academy Award for best animated feature film.2 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I am Mexican and I think that this film really has a Mexican essence, I can say that the colors used are representative of Mexico and the story (the script) was somewhat descriptive of Mexicans combined with the music that has been enjoyed watching it.2 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Such a tribute to the Mexican heritage - shown so well in the history of the family, the history of the family problem, the legends of the Day of the Dead.

As a Latino, I can't put into words just how beautiful it felt to hear the music in the film. I don't remember the last time the music in a film was able to move me so much. That goes for the entire film. I had heard so much about how sad it was, but I honestly think this is one of the most genuinely happy films I have probably ever seen. There's sadness sprinkled in there, but most of the emotion derives from watching such lovable, magical characters convey themes so eternal and personal. A lot of films intend to teach you the importance of family and all that clich\u00e9d stuff, but this is that rare film that truly earns it and truly rises above others to make you get it. Maybe I connected so much to it because I am of the culture, but wow do I think this is a truly special gem, needed so badly in a year like this. After it was over my friend turned to me and said \"Don't you dare say anything negative about this right now because I won't be able to take it.\" I'm sure there are flaws in there, but the whole thing conveys such power rarely seen in animated films, and as far as I'm concerned, power that even most Pixar films don't carry.

We've heard fun songs, we've got blown away by an unexpected twist, we learned something and we've definitely enjoyed this movie. I'd even go as far as to say that this is one of the best animated movies that I've ever seen.The story is fascinated me as Pixar once again played with my emotions and got me thinking about my relatives and the afterlife. We celebrate All Saints' Day in Lithuania and the holiday is a bit different than depicted in this movie but the idea is more or less of the same, the one major difference is that we go to visit the ones we miss instead of putting a shire to them at our own homes.The music has a special charm since it's in Spanglish and the tone is cheerful, it made us laugh, it made us want to sing along and it was very heartwarming.I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of the final chapter and the epilogue. Yes, it was the most emotional part of the movie but the whole sequence was a bit too much for me. I still enjoyed it, almost shed a tear myself but it feels like a bunch of different ideas were combined into one big one that kind of lacks structure.

The animation was excellent. A glimpse of the Mexican culture seems to have been decently showcased, and I say glimpse because their culture is so much richer and much more authentic than portrayed. However, the glimpse was good enough.The characters were unique and memorable; and their voice actors did an excellent job.The plot had a few nice twists and this surely helped it win the Oscar. The plot had a beautiful message for the characters and for us the viewers that also surely helped it win the Oscar.My only complaint and dissatisfaction about this film was the songs - I did not love or even like any of them. Sure, \"Remember me\" is supposed to be a good song, but the lyrics are very weak and basic, and the instrumental is also weak and basic, as in with zero musical creativity. These songs were vey amateur and basic and not creative whatsoever. Thus, I knocked down one star from my review because the music was just so bad - not one catchy song. Zero creativity in any of these original songs. This was extremely disappointing given the fact that music plays a huge role in this movie.Conclusion: the plot is great and it has a beautiful and powerful message for the characters and for us the viewers. The animation was great. The director and everyone else did a great job. The ending was great. However, all the original songs in this movie were mediocre and immediately forgettable, which was extremely disappointing given the fact that this movie revolves entirely around music.9/10", "Coco had Lee Unkrich's hand all over it, being the lead director, solo screen writter, and solo editor. Lee Unkrich is a big name in the Pixar industry, especially in the Toy Story family. Even though Unkrich had huge positions in this film, he had a great support system from some familiar faces in Darla K. Anderson, John Lasseter & Adrian Molina. Being Pixar's first hispanic movie, it brought a lot of attention, and raked in 807 million dollars at the box office. Not only was Coco such a huge success in the box office, Coco won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.Coco got a lot of well deserved praise, which is tough to argue against, but it just didn't appeal to my personal palat\u00e9. This story had a very focused narrative, focusing on a realistic message to kids about family, culture, life & death, while adding great emotional notes, and some okay laughs. Putting the positives aside for a minute, Coco in some aspects, still felt a little clich\u00e9 and predictable, while over using the same song, outplaying it's creativity.With the large surplus of characters, it was tough to really balance everyone, and make them equally important. The only characters I really cared about was Miguel, Dant\u00e9 & H\u00e9ctor. Even though Dant\u00e9 is a unoriginal animal addition, and being the cause of roughly 40% of the problems, he was great. He added a lot of brainless humor that could keep everyone entertained. Miguel, voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, is a charming, young, hispanic spirit. Unkrich made it pretty easy to get behind him and feel for him. One of my main complaints about him is that, even though he was enjoyable, his character development was pretty flat. H\u00e9ctor, voiced by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal was conniving and slick, yet pretty funny. His character development, and bond he built with Miguel, turned out to be for the better, saving him from being part of the plot device characters.The screenplay was very family oriented, with hit or miss jokes, but consistently hit the emotional notes, to kept everyone involved.Pixar is known for creating and building these unique worlds', and this new world is nothing short of inventive. The art directors in Harley Jessup, Don Shank, Tim Evatt, & Courtney Casper Kent, have so much background with Pixar alone, so their back drops, and details go without say, gorgeous.The score by Michael Giacchino had a great mexican vibe to it, with the soundtrack just being just okay.", "Coco is a powerful and unforgettable story of family, of love, and of music. Backdropped by the tradition of the Day of the Dead within Mexican culture, the film displays, Miguel, a young and relatable boy who lives a story of adventure and search for truth in hope of rescuing both his dream for music, and, unbeknownst to him, his own family, cultural heritage, and soul. Touching and beautiful, musical and memorable, Coco is a visual treat for children, an emotional good to parents, and a family joy for all.

There are moments where it gets a bit cringe worthy, it kind of slows to a crawl at points, and it struggled to keep my attention at times, but it's a solid movie. The best part of the movie was at the tail end of it. Roughly, the last 30 minutes was the most exciting and entertaining part of the movie. I honestly would have liked the movie to have followed that plot point a bit more, but it does set the lore of the world really well. I do feel like I waited too long to see it, though. It maybe would have had a greater impact on me a few years ago. Right now, I just sort of feel like it was a solid, but standard movie. Not bad, but also not really living up to all the hype that I'd heard about it at the time. I often find that to be the case with movies that get super hyped by the general public, though. I'd watch it again, but I would also be okay with missing the first half of the movie and coming in on the latter half where things get really good. I will say this, the colors were beautiful. It was such a wonderfully colorful movie. I wish that I could have been younger when I saw this. I think if I had been, it would have resonated with me more. As it is, it's quite decent. Very good even. It just didn't hold my attention as well as I would have liked, and the most interesting and entertaining part of the movie was more of a footnote to the main movie. As to how well Pixar embraced and represented the culture, I can't really speak for it myself.

People here sing and dance, but their home is an exception.All this stems from Miguel's great-grandfather. In the past, he abandoned his wife, Miguel's great-grandmother, in pursuit of musical dreams, which made her very sad, and since then great-grandmother has banned any music in the family.But Miguel inherited his great-grandfather's gene for music. He secretly imagined that he would one day become an famous musician like an idol Cruz.On the day of the Mexican Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally entered the world of the undead. In this world, he saw his long-dead ancestors. In order to get guidance on the road to realize the dream of music, Miguel decided to go to find his Idol Cruz's undead, he found his great-grandfather,I don't want them to be sent to a big pit by Cruz.\nIn fact, many years ago, his great-grandfather and Kreuz were a pair, and they wrote many songs.For his musical dream, he stayed away from his wife and daughter. One day, his great-grandfather missed his daughter very much, so he resolutely decided to go back. It was useless to keep Kruze, so he took a glass of poisoned wine, poisoned his great-grandfather, and wrote all the music composed by his great-grandfather. According to his own, became a world-renowned musician.\nSeeing the film here, I think the plot is a bit bloody. I was also worried about their future because if the boy did n't go back before dawn, the boy would die.Suddenly a big cat with wings and his great-grandmother appeared in the sky. The great-grandmother burst into tears and asked him why he had abandoned her and her daughter. She hadn't waited for him all her life.

When we were young, we did n't want to go the path paved by our family. Those who once stumbled wanted to pursue their dreams. But in the end it was found that family reunion is the happiest.

Kung Fu Panda 2 did the same, but this movie just brought a new level of storytelling.You got this young Mexican kid named Miguel, who grew up in his family's compound where his family banned all things music because of a tradition his great-great-great grandma enforced after her husband abandoned her and their daughter. It's a movie about trust, mending broken ties, fighting for your dreams, music, and family.I can't tell you how beautiful this movie is. The detail, the lighting, the setting, the MUSIC! But one thing I adored was how it stayed so close to the Mexican culture it was portraying. Now, it's very easy for movies to use real life cultural customs in their movies and never add any significance or whitewash them. Never once did I feel like this movie whitewashed anything. This was the most accurate portrayal of Mexican culture I've seen in animation, and what a beautiful story it was.The music was special. I have a young niece who shares my passion of animated films. She's was 7-years-old when I took her to see this movie with me because I wanted to spend time with her. I just want to say, 'Remember Me' became our song. I learned the guitar part just so when we're together we can sing it. She adored this movie with her heart just as I do. There's been a lot of memorable Disney/Pixar songs, but this movie produced some of the best music I've ever listened to. I'll never forget it. My niece is now 10 and we still sing this to each other. It's adorable.Can I call it the best movie ever?Yes. Yes I can. And I'll do it now-Best Movie EVER!Just watch it. You need to watch to understand why I said this. Perfect for the family. A pure tear jerker worth every bit of praise it got.Final rating- 11/10Thank you so much Pixar for yet another great film!", "We are part of the human race, and human beings are passionate.

Death and love are the core themes. The story revolves around the twelve-year-old Mexican boy Miguel's pursuit of a music dream. Miguel loves music, but in the concept of family, their family is cursed by music, so his dream is rejected by his family. So Miguel embarked on a dream-seeking journey secretly.\nBy chance, he touched a guitar, which brought him into the world of the undead. Surprisingly, instead of being cold and horrible, this world is colorful. There are hairless dogs unique to Mexico, colorful paper-cuts, delicious traditional Mexican food ... everything is the same as the real world, or even more wonderful. More importantly, in this beautiful new world, he reunited with his deceased relatives and regained his affection. At this time, Miguel's dream was no longer just a guitar, a game, but to enjoy the strong warmth supported and accompanied by his family. In the process, his dream has been sublimated and his life has become fuller.\nFrom the perspective of literary narrative, the movie story itself does not transcend tradition. The deep connotation of \"Looking for a Dream\" is to portray an undead world with humanistic temperature and a view of life and death. Through the movie, we will even believe that death is not indifferent and lonely, there can still be loved ones and friends, there are beautiful things to meet unexpectedly, and there are dreams to chase.", "Wow!

Therefore, the tone of the film is not dark and negative, but it has sadness and nostalgia inseparable from death.

It celebrates family, Mexican culture, and finding yourself. And it is a beautiful piece of animation. Animation and story wise. Lee Unkrich's Coco follows the 12-year old Miguel who dreams of becoming a musician against his entire family's will. When he arrives to the Land of the Dead, he meets his great-great grandfather and asks for his help. \"Coco\" is filled with warmth, and it is very emotional at times. Anthony Gonzales and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, voicing Miguel and H\u00e9ctor respectively, portrays the film's two main characters with a lot of heart and it's hard not to love the duo and their troublesome journey to find appreciation for each other. The inspiration for the film is, unsurprisingly, the Mexican tradition of D\u00eda de los Muertos, and the animation crew has done an incredible work in transitioning the traditional festivities and its atmosphere to the big screen. I would argue that \"Coco\" is the most brilliantly animated Pixar film to date. An issue I've had with computer animated films are their lack of originality in design and esthetics, when compared to traditional animation. But \"Coco\" brings you nothing but the best.

This movie follows a kid named miguel who is in love with music, however his family hates it, especially his grandmother. Now this cause a drift/ tension between Miguel and his other family members. So on his own he sneaks around pllaying music even though music of any kind is banned in his family. Well one day based of the guitar he has in his family photo he believes Ernesto de la cruz his idol and music legend is his father and after stealing his character from his sanctuary he transported to the world of the dead. Now in order to get back home he needs to receive a blessing from one of his dead family members before the raise or death awaits him.\nNow lets talk about some of the characters. Miguel is a generic character who wants to do what he believes in, but unfortunately his family won't let him. Nothing special, but works for this movie.\nNow Abuelita the grandmother on the other hand is such an annoying character. Its to unrealistic for her to hate music so much to the point she dictates the entire family to stop listiening or playing music all together.\nErnesto de la cruz is a cool character on the other hand, and the quite frankly the usual disney twist villain really worked here. Although I will say how we find out he actually killed Miguel real great great grandfather Hector was so stupid. He basically admitted it in a moive lol.\nImelda who is miguel great great grandmother is an arlgiht character. She hates Hectpr because he frankly did abandon his family to pursue his music dreams, which is completely understandable. Although still banning all music is kind of dumb. Regardless I really like how she cares for miguel and they are family and she really does want im to get back home. Although she wants all music of his to be banned is very stupid and I very much dislike how she basically in love with Hector again even if she finds out the truth. At the end of the day Hector still left his family alone with no means to make money until Imelda eventually started a shoe buisness.\nNow lets talk about the best character in the show Hector. The dude just doesn't want to be forgotten by his daugher coco in the living world because when your forgotten in the day of the dead I guess that means you cease to exist. Anyway his personality was great, he goes from being some immature  con artist to a likeable kind man. Although I would have preferred if you know maybe he was a bad as family made him out to be and for him to had been forgotten, I understand this is a kids movie. So in all honesty the twist with him actually had wanted to comeback to his family, but Ernesto food poisoned him was still great and I'm glad he gets the due credit he deserves for all songs he wrote that Ernesto took credit for. Now the callback with how Ernesto gets a bell falling on him in the dead word which is the exact way on how he died in the living world was nice. Although him being forgotten didn't make the mose sense to me....like what only a year past since he was defamed and your tellining no one remembers him anymore.", "Disney & Pixar created another absolutely beautiful film!0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "One of the best animated movies I've ever seen.

This I Hope is the start of the comeback for original Pixar Films. The plot not only was tragic and interesting, but also did a really great job at educating everyone about El Dia De Los Muertos. The Characters are well thought out and lovable, and the music is honestly perfect.\nHowever some of the comedy didn't feel right in this, and the villain of course is a twist.\nDespite the cliche of De La Cruz being the villain, I think it still works (at least much better than a fair amount of Pixar twist villains) . I just wish they could do something new since a great majority of their films include twist villains.\nI think this film is great and a very good step in the right direction for Pixar!", "Coco, is a movie made by Disney and Pixar, a massive collaboration of two famous studios. Directed by Lee Unkrich, This movie is the most melancholic movie I've ever seen. Coupled with the scene, sounds, and dubbing from the character that is very integrated with the movie, adds its melancholy value.\nThis movie tell the story about Miguel Riviera, a boy who wants to be a legendary musician, who lives in a family that prohibits music and thinks music is a curse. Even whistling is forbidden. Miguel has a strong desire for music. Moreover, he is inspired by Ernesto De La Cruz, a famous Mexican musician. Supposedly told that, Miguel's great-grandfather is a famous Mexican musician who leave his family to catch up his career.\nMiguel has found that he has a similarity with De La Cruz. So he decide to imitate him, becoming a great musician. In short story, Miguel got lost in the land of death because of his carelessly stealing De La Cruz's Legendary Guitar. With his crazy friend, Hector and the dog, Dante. Miguel starts his adventure in the Land Of Death.\nCoco is very thick with Mexican culture and elevates Dia de Muertos tradition. namely the tradition of celebrating and remembering the goodness of the ancestors and recalling the memories of family members who have passed away. The close relationship of the family become the main message in this movie. An example is the existence of a photo of a deceased family. The photo then becomes unique due to the many mysteries revealed in it.The animations, music, sound effect were blend very well. Especially the land of death which is potrayed in a very beautiful color. And the music,tho. Has a catchy melody which really eargasm. When miguel sing it (The tittle is Remember Me) for Mama Imelda, his grandmother, My heart touched. Because the feels was so real, Mama Imelda is senile. She remembers her father after hearing miguel's sings. Like a blade, all these excess must have a shortage. The scene when Miguel lost at the land of death, is easy to guess. I get interested when the truth has been spoken. Instead of its disadvantages, Coco is a worth-to-watch animation movie. Also, this movie can be watched by all ages.This collaboration disney and pixar attracted the attention of many parties. Even though they have a mystery about the culture of people dying, this movie doesn't show any scary impression at all. I was impressed with the amazing visuals. Everything is detailed and colored. The plot-twist was made interestingly and unexpected.We can draw many moral value from this movie. Such as, we must respected for our loved ones who have passed away. This movie also teaches us that when people die, only the body is lost. But the memory, will still be embedded in our heart. As a conlusion, this movie is suitable for watching with our family. It can teach us many lessons about love, forgive, and never forget everything that has gone.", "Coco is such a lovely film with beautiful animation, vibrant colours, great musical numbers and is very touching.

At this point, I'm convinced Pixar could just go ahead and shoot live video and put their animated characters in the scene and I'd still think the whole thing was animated. The interplay of color, light, and shadow really come out in this celebration of Mexican culture. All spectacular visuals aside, Pixar again delivers on an emotional impact that left me crying, as always. When it comes to new ideas, Pixar certainly still knows how to create a visually-compelling story.While Coco has a lot going for it, there are a few weaknesses, some of which are my own opinion based on my likes and dislikes. I know the film mostly targets children (and older children at that), but the plot was just a smidge too predictable. Sure, it was enjoyable to see my hypotheses play out on the screen, but the twists weren't anything too groundbreaking. Secondly, I'm sure the street dog was endearing for those who like dogs, but I found it to be more annoying than a vital part of the plot.Not necessarily a weakness, I'm a little torn on the message of the movie. Having recently visited Mexico for the first time this January, I had a greater appreciation of the culture presented here. However, even if the \"family first\" motif felt a little bit like the plot from a Fast and Furious film, I also wanted to root for the young boy who wanted to pursue his passions and dreams despite his family's adamant restrictions. By the end, there's a happy medium, but when I want the main character to divorce himself from his family so he can do what he enjoys, then there might be a problem.A fantastic and culturally-rich masterpiece from Pixar, I give Coco 4.5 stars out of 5.", "It pushed me into tears.

In all aspects, from the musical numbers, to the voice characters, to the storytelling, and of course the colorful animation, this is a superb film.I almost feel guilty for not giving it a 9 or 10, but while the film did give me a lump in my throat, it did so using well honed plot twist techniques, such as turning an apparent hero into a demon, or swiftly reconciling people even though one of them has hated the other for 100 years.

Although both films are partially set in the Land Of The Dead that is where the similarities end.A beautifully sculpted, written and directed film about the hubris of youth and how meeting ones heroes is never what is expected.

The movie is centered around a child named Miguel and his family during the festival of Dia de Muertos. It begins with a backstory of his great great grandfather walking out on his wife and child to pursue his music career and never returns. But the wife steps up and takes matters into her own hands. She teaches herself to make shoes and begins a business. Since her husband left her for music she forever forbids music from her family. The music hating tradition is passed down through the generations. But this seems to be a problem for Miguel because he loves music and wants to a musician. He secretly plays the guitar and listen to music. Soon he learns that his great great grandfather is his lifetime idol, Ernesto de la Cruz. With this information he declares to his family that he is going be a musician but is crushed when forcibly say no. So he runs away to prove that is great at music at the local music contest but he needs is a guitar. He tries to find one, but no one will give him one. He eventually goes to the grave of great great grandfather and borrows his famous guitar but when plays it he is sent into the land of the dead. He meets his extended family and tells them of his plan to become musician. But his great great grandmother forbids it and he runs off to find his great great grandfather, Ernesto de la Cruz, with a man he meets named Hector. Miguel is sent through a wild journey through the land of the dead to find his great great grandfather while learn the importance of family and the meaning of music. In the end learns that Hector is his actual great great grandfather and Ernesto de la Cruz murdered him to get all of his songs and that is why he never returned to his family. Miguel goes back to land of the living tells the truth of what happened and becomes a musician. \n There are many reasons why I love the movie Coco. One of them is the great visual details and the beautiful array of colors. The level of Pixar's computer animation has come a long way from the beginning. The city streets and walk ways covered in cobblestone and colorful festival decorations seem so photo realistic that you would think it was real picture in a travel magazine. And the land of the dead was so beautiful. The bridge between the worlds was a great visual connection between all the flowers in the living world and the connection between the other world. Another reason why I loved this movie was the great music and guitar work. The music was warm as the tone and theme of the movie. But what did you expect from Disney and Pixar? They always kill it in the music department. The movie also brought so many people into Mexican and Spanish culture. The movie gave great details about El Dia de Muertos and made the holiday seem like we have known it for years. It made remembering those who have come before us theme seem more important than before. In conclusion, Pixar's movie Coco is another great motion picture to add to the Disney collection.", "Not afraid to say that the studio \"Disney\" really makes history. With each new cartoon, it becomes more and more obvious. \"Mystery Koko\" won me over half a year ago with her dizzy trailer, from which I literally had goose bumps all over my body. This animated film, another masterpiece of the film company Pixar, has become a ray of light among the gloomy and elegiac premieres of this year. Kind, bright and colorful - it will fill your hearts with pleasant longing for close people and remind you what it is like to cry from happiness and truly love.The main character is a carefree 12-year-old boy named Miguel, who is passionately in love with music. Relatives Miguel reasonably categorically against the boy's passion, because her husband had left his great-great-grandmother long time ago, leaving her and their little daughter to their own devices and deciding to follow the call of their heart - to compose music and eventually achieve people's recognition. Miguel was not determined to give up and decided to prove to his family that music is part of his soul, without which the boy's life does not make sense. By an incredible coincidence, on the Day of the Dead, Miguel enters the other world, where he meets his deceased relatives and finds a new friend - a balabola named Hector, who aspires to get into the world of the living to see his daughter. Together they go in search of the famous Mexican musician Ernesto de la Cruz, with whom Miguel feels an inexplicable connection.\"The Mystery of Coco\" for two hours will make you cry and laugh and remember what and who really matters in your life. An amazing story about how important it is to follow your dreams and appreciate the love and care of the most dear people. From a visual point of view, the cartoon is literally stunning. The way the characters' emotions are drawn (which is Miguel's face, when the grandmother threatens to break his guitar or when he sings the great-grandmother songs from her childhood), the architecture of cities, nature, makes you wonder what a computer man is capable of today. The most beautiful for me was the scene where Miguel walks on a flower bridge of orange petals, getting into the city of the Dead. To give an assessment of the visual part of the cartoon, one word is enough: amazing.Lee Ankrich and John Lasseter, who gave the world such animation tapes as Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Cars, do not lose their grip and continue to do truly extraordinary things, filling people's lives with faith in miracle, love, sincerity and the very the main thing is faith in your dream. The Secret of Coco is the perfect reminder of all those important things that we sometimes forget. In particular, how to tell your loved ones more often about their importance. Summing up, I want to say that it is very important that modern children grow up on such cartoons. \"Mystery Coco\" has absorbed the best from moral and visual points of view. No spoiled, it deserves only the highest ratings and reviews. It was just fantastic.", "Coco is a marvellous film. Better than Wall-E.

And personally I like it a lot. Their earlier films were more about friendship, adventure, all that usual stuff. And it was great. But in their recent films they've found this voice, this message to carry. I honestly think that in Inside Out and Coco they have made their two best yet. And that's a high bar indeed.Coco tells about young Miguel, a shoemaker by legacy, but who carries a secret passion for music within. Unfortunately his family couldn't have a lower opinion about the beauty of tunes, song and strings. But then Miguel learns that his many times grandfather just might be the most legendary singer his nation has ever known.And when he accidentally gets transported to the Land of the Dead, what better chance to seek out this elusive relative of his.While the central message of Coco ends up being the importance of family, it's also a powerful movie about passion and what it means to seek it. And how these two huge things don't have to be contradictory. It also really works as a general story. The plot flows absolutely flawlessly. You can kind of guess the end twist, but at the same time it's told so beautifully, so naturally, that you have to appreciate the craftsmanship, if nothing else.Add one of the best scores in a Pixar film yet (fitting, really), stunningly beautiful colours and sets, identifiable characters, good humour and so much more, and you have a nigh perfect film for all ages in your hand. Coco is a masterpiece, no questions asked, and one of my personal favourite films from Pixar. From Disney-Pixar, for that matter.", "Coco, an animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, showcases the life of a young Mexican boy named Miguel. Throughout the story, an emphasis on family arises. Miguel has a tight-knit family where traditions and unity play a big role. Family dynamics are big in the film, and it made me wonder, are traditional Mexican families and their culture portrayed correctly in this film? In Coco, the first thing I noticed about family dynamics was that Miguel's family had multiple generations living under one roof. Miguel's grandmother and great-grandmother lived in the same house as Miguel and his parents. According to Judit Garcia, \"2, 3 or more (generations) would live together in one household\" (2013). Since I found through multiple sources that multi-generation households are common in Mexico, it proves that Miguel's family was not out of the ordinary and that his extremely large family was actually quite normal. The next aspect of family that became apparent was the family business. The business means a lot to the family, and all the men are expected to work in the family business. The responsibility of working for the family business is huge in Miguel's family and a lot of pressure is set on the men. According to a resource from an online database, \"Family unity and responsibility are high priorities ... Family ties represent lifelong commitments\" (Mexico: Family, 2018). The family business is a family tie, and according to the database, it represents lifelong commitments. This is correctly portrayed in the movie as almost all members of the family do their part for the family business. While using databases, the most important and recurring topic I came across was family unity. Unity is huge in Mexican families and it's what allows for families to stay connected for long periods of time. According to an International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family, \"Family transcends individuals and generations. The family brings together the past, present, and future through kinship ties\" (Sanchez-Aragon, 2003). Families in Mexico try to stay connected the best they can, and responsibility is a huge part of that. Miguel's family uses unity and responsibility to fuel their relationship, and I think the same goes for most Mexican families. Overall, I believe that Coco was an authentically correct film that correctly portrayed major aspects of the Mexican culture. On a culture scale, I would give Coco a rating of 9/10 and would completely recommend it as your next movie choice.", "The movie Coco follows a little boy through his journey on Dia De Los Muertos otherwise known as the Day of the Dead. I believe that the producers of the movie Coco were able to create a accurate representation of the Mexican culture surrounding Dia De Los Muertos. As shown in the film, the idea of Dia De Los Muertos is to remember and be with the family that have passed away. In an article that Rosales, F. Arturo he stated, \"Days of the Dead, a religious observance celebrated throughout Mexico on November 2, honors the memories of departed family members\" (204-206). This idea was shown all throughout the movie considering that it is what the whole movie Coco was based off of. This is celebrated in many cultures around the world, but mostly in spanish cultures located in Mexico. This is actually shown in the film as Miguel and his family live in Mexico. When it comes to specific facts that comes with celebrating Dia De Los Muertos, the movie was very specific with most details. In an article that Hugo G. Nutini wrote he stated that, \"food offerings were made to the dead in the cemeteries. Special food offerings, consisting of a dish or drink that he or she had particularly liked, were made to prominent departed members of the household\" (2227-2231). This was accurately represented in the film as Miguel and his family left food for their family that had past away on their altar which is otherwise known as a \"ofrendas\". They placed special foods next to the pictures of the deceased family members. It was also shown in the film that other people were gathered by a deceased's gravestone with food offerings and other gifts. One aspect that the producers and writers of Coco did not include was that there are often two days celebrated when it comes to Day of the Dead; one for the deceased children under the age of 18 and then one for everyone over the age of 18. In an article that Pilcher, Jeffrey M. Pilcher wrote, \"The angelitos (deceased children) return on the evening of October 31 and the adults on the following night, although the dates in local celebrations vary all the way from October 28 to November 4\" (505-506). Although the film did show people of all ages visiting their families during one night, I think they could have added a little more context to the culture behind the two days. All things considered, I believe they were able to capture most parts of the Day of the Dead aspect of the Mexican culture and I would argue that this was a great movie.", "Coco Review \n Coco is a great movie to watch. It was very funny and family friendly. It talks about one of the major holidays in the Hispanic culture being Dia de los Muertos. It is a huge holiday and has so much that is needed to be correct in order to actually represent the holiday. For example the food that they typically would have for the holiday are the favorite foods of the passed. They do a great job recognizing this in the movie. They say they will have certain foods based on the people. Also they do a great job talking about music. In Mexico there is music everywhere. People go and listen to music in the park and on the streets. And that is very well represented in the movie with the talent show that happens. Everyone is very excited about the show and a lot of people are signing up. It's a great example of how they treat music. The thing that the movie Coco does best is talk about the family dynamics. The main thing that they try to show in the movie is how the family comes first no matter what. If the family does not like something then the entire family is to not like it. They start as a family and end as a family. Also much of the family lives together under the same roof. So it can get crammed but that is the culture of it. But most importantly it shows that the oldest in the house is the boss. Weather it is a male or female they rule the house.(Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia) \n Overall though the movie gets a solid 8 out of 10. The reasoning behind that score is because of how much the movie also missed.The country of Mexico has some incorrect facts about it. It doesn't show 100% the correct things about the country. For example the way people travel in Mexico is just like here in America, Cars (Mexico Cities of the World). It shows the people walk everywhere to get places. There are barely any cars in the movie. It just lacks the small details of the culture and lifestyle about Mexico. But Overall it is a great movie and has an awesome message to it. I would recommend you go check it out.", "Lexie Zemann4/18/18Mr. GrossIn the movie Coco, family dynamics are very apparent and historically accurate. A movie that incorporates family dynamics successfully is one that can capture the characters' interactions perfectly, which adds to the overall message. Without family dynamics, films can be bland, and sometimes the viewers have a harder time connecting to the characters; however, when these dynamics are present, viewers can feel a part of not just the lives of the characters, but also to their cultures. Therefore, the film gets 4.5 stars because it incorporates many aspects that give the family and the Mexican culture depth, so that the people watching can really understand and relate to everything that is going on. \n One aspect of this culture that Miguel has grown up in is the living accommodations; the elders of the family live all under one roof with him. This causes tension because Miguel is expected to honor his elders and his father by becoming a shoe maker. Unfortunately, his heart is elsewhere, namely his music. Another characteristic of the Mexican culture seen in the home is how Mexicans honor their dead. \"Ofrendas are set up to remember and honor the memory of their ancestors. Before setting an altar, they thoroughly clean their house. We must remember they are going to have very important 'visitors'\" (p. 1). These ofrendas give great depth to how family members interact with each other and with their neighbors, as most Mexican families observe this tradition.\n Mr. Unkrich, the director of Coco, was raised just outside of Cleveland and had no experience with the celebration of \"Dia de los Muertos\". He wanted to be sure his movie was historically accurate, so he took several trips to Mexico and interviewed Latino actors and actresses in the film to get their personal stories, \"which helped ground his fantasy realm with specific geographic and sociological roots\" (p. 2). The results are shown through the popularity and success of the film.", "The colorful and entertaining film Coco deserves a 4.5/5 stars because of how accurately it represents Mexican culture or more specifically The Day of The Dead. The representation of the souls of the dead coming back in spirit to see their loved ones is very well shown throughout the entire film. On the day of the dead Miguel wants to perform at the plaza, instead he ends up becoming one of the souls and goes in spirit to try and find what he's looking for.\n His dead family members were in the midst of coming back in spirit to visit there family when they run into Miguel, who is half dead, half alive. Hugo Nutini defines Day of the Dead as, \"During the vigil of November 2 the souls of the dead come back in spirit to bless the household where they had died\" (2,227-2,231). In the film Coco they did a very good job of making clear that it was November 2nd, the day of the dead. Towards the end of the film Miguel's dead family members make it back to there family and they bless the house in spirit as they dance around and eat dishes of there favorite food.\n In the film Coco they talked very much about the \"dead\" crossing the bridge on November 2nd. In the end of the film it shows the family crossing the bridge to be reconnected again in spirit. \"Crossing the bridge\" was mentioned many times in the movie, rekindling the living and the dead by crossing the bridge to all be together again. Sandoval Ricardo defines crossing the bridge as, \"Fall holiday plans bridge two cultures that are drawing closer to each other every year in Mexico,\" (17-18). In the movie Coco, it showed how Miguel's family members were crossing the bridge into the real world to see their family members. The bridge and crossing it is heavily symbolized throughout the movie. For example, Hector's whole goal in the movie is to cross the bridge into the living so he can his daughter Coco. There were also many more references about how Miguel wouldn't be able to cross the bridge back into the living when it reached dawn. \nNot only does Coco bring the much needed cultural aspects to make the film great, but it was also a big change for the movie industry in promoting different cultural films. The timing of the film was very important, and not only to make Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans proud at a time when they were being knocked down, but for other people to see them in a more positive light. Overall the film Coco was empowering and accurate when telling the festivities and traditions about the day of the dead.", "Miguel, a 12 year old boy, dreams of becoming a musician. His family on the other hand, despises any kind of music, because of past events and has banished music from their home. Miguel ventures into the Land of the Dead to find his musical idol, Ernesto de la Cruz, while unveiling family secrets along the way.Dia de los Muertos is a holiday celebrated by most Latin-American countries and some parts of the United States. Each year family members honor the spirits of their deceased loved ones. In the recent Disney/Pixar movie Coco, this cultural holiday is the main event of the movie. Throughout the film, Coco focuses on the importance of family on this day. While displaying this theme on the screen, it is also important in the real world. According to CultureGrams', they confirm that \"...an altar in their homes dedicated to the deceased that includes flowers, rosaries and photos of the dead; candles are lit on these altars to guid the soul on the path to heaven\" (\"Life Cycle\" 1). In Coco, you see all of these items or ideas shown. During D\u00eda de los Muertos for Miguel's family, they do exactly this- create an altar in honor of the person or people there are remembering, set up flowers, photos and their favorite meal or dish. Even when Miguel was trapped in the Land of the Dead, he learned that in order for anyone there during the Day of the Dead needed to be remembered. Specifically by having a photo of yourself somewhere with your loved ones in the real world. This is closely related to \"candles are lit on these altars to guide the soul on the path to heaven\". At the beginning of the movie, when Miguel and his family are celebrating D\u00eda de los Muertos we notice that the surroundings of the holiday- the altars, flowers, pictures and food could be set up anywhere. Google Arts & Culture agrees that \"offerings vary from one region to another. The festival can be celebrated at home, at the cemetery, on the ground, around a table, as a family or as a community\" (Day of the Dead Festival 3). When watching Coco, you notice that Miguel's family recognized his dead family members whether or not it was in the cemetery, in his home, or in his family's courtyard. We even see the community gathering to remember Ernesto de la Cruz, as the star he was.In the Mexican and Latino cultures, the variety of ways to celebrate this holiday is exhibited in Coco extremely well. All throughout this movie we see how the events occuring, relate to real life families and communities. Not only is the holiday, D\u00eda de los Muertos shown, but also the respect for elders, love of music, reflection of our loved ones and the power of friendship. Coco is the right choice when wanting to see a comical, cultural, heart-jerking and knowledgeable film.", "Overview: If you enjoy family films, made up of stunning visuals, and a well written family friendly storyline; then Coco may be the movie for you. This film is based around the importance of family values and acceptance amongst your family and community. These factors can have an impact on a person's development. If you enjoy movies that are based around family traditions and culture, this is also a good movie to watch as you are immersed into a story that not only explains the Latino culture, but it also gives you many beautiful representations of what the people of this culture believe in.\nVisuals: Personally, I rather enjoyed the film Coco. The artwork was very well done; the contrast of the light and dark, and the vibrant colors alongside the darker contrasting colors were very well done. Not only do the designs look beautiful, but the creators were able to emphasize specific scenes and objects by doing this. If you are a sucker for digital creations and animations like I am, then I would highly recommend this film for that factor alone. I found that when comparing the objects from the movies to the real world, they were able to catch its characteristics very thoroughly, and at a very professional level.\nStoryline: When it comes to a films storyline, then it is important to include as much specific, and relevant information to the storyline. In order to contribute to the depth of the story's characters, and events taking place. Without these details being included, the story can be very confusing to those watching the movie. I'm going to be honest with you, I was in fact confused during many events taking place within Coco. However, I am able to conclude that this was just due to me not having much experience, and/or knowledge about the Latino culture beforehand. With doing more research on the Latino culture after watching Coco, I was able to learn that this movie is rather accurate in its family and cultural value aspects. With all of the amazing representations of the culture, I highly suggest it.\nFamily Values/Culture: Are you looking for a good family movie that expresses the great importance for family bonds and values? Do you want a movie about the importance of family elders and tradition that you're able to enjoy with your loved ones? If you answered yes to any of these, then Coco is the movie for you. Coco is expressed at a very large level to be based around family values, relationships, and cultural norms. \nMost of the representations within Coco are accurate including the importance of dancing and music amongst families of the Latino culture. However, due to previous events that happened within the main character's family's past, dancing is forbidden. Miguel, who is the main character that the perspective of the story follows loves music and dancing. \"Dancing is a very important part of their culture and everyone is expected to know how to and dance along with the family\" (4 Culture) In the movie Coco, while this is true for everyone else around them, their family is excluded from this.\nSomething expressed within the movie was the great importance of elders. \"Grandparents typically play a large role in the grandchildren's upbringing. This helps them learn important life lessons.\" (Latino) Miguel's grandmother is an excellent example of this because she proves to be, on many occasions, the head of the household. The only aspect of their culture that could really counter this would be the value of women within their culture. While women are an important role, \"They are responsible for teaching Latino children culture and religion, and teaching them how to be responsible and to be able to care for their family along with the community.\" (Carteret) However, along with that, \"Men are placed over women and given rights that are otherwise denied to women.\" (Clark) These two aspects are not well represented within the film. I would argue that they even represented the opposites of both of these. \nWhile these can \"...change depending on the area...\" (Carteret) as Coco was not based in an outside country such as America, these aspects of the culture remain rather constant. In the past, \"Women have had less authority, rights, and influence within the family and their culture within the original areas. However, this has often changed within other countries after migration.\" (Garcia) If you look at the movie through this perspective, it could very well be interpreted that Coco did not take place within Mexico, but there is no mention of this during the film. While we didn't get a very good look into the man or father of the household, typically the father \"plays the role of respect and authority. The traditional view on manhood is strongly influenced by machismo... men should be strong, brave, and honorable, and they should also provide for their families.\" (Clark) This may be relevant or seen in one or two scenes, but for the most par the man's role within a Latino family is left out of the story. Which is still alright as there were so many other cultural representations throughout the film.\nAs a whole, \"While Americans can be seen more as being \"task-oriented,\" Latinos tend to be more focused on relationships. Family and community participation is very important to their culture.\" (Carteret) With this being said, the importance of gender roles in some areas have become less of a priority which can also be an example of why Coco could be considered very accurate even in this instance. It is very important to remember that within the Latino culture, family is the most important. Very often, \"Family needs come before individual needs and this is evident in Latino's desire to center many activities around the extended family.\" (Ramirez) SPOILER: One of these examples is when Miguel's family finally decides that maybe music isn't so bad, and that he should be aloud to pursue it to his heart's desire. Within both the culture and Coco, the families \"...take pride in their family values and worth.\" (4 Culture) This definitely shows the great importance of the culture, and how they strive to stay and work together.\nAnother important aspect within the culture that is greatly expressed throughout the film is the existence of extended families. \"Extended families could be large as couples could have 10-12 children, even after the 70s, having five children was considered modern and a sign of contraceptive use. In addition to the children, at least two sets of grandparents and sometimes even more family members (children and spouses) lived within one household.\" (Garcia) This was largely represented within Coco because Miguel's family was so large consisting of all of the cultural expectations. All of the family members had roles to play within the family and this helped them not only work together for the family, but also their family business. Though, when watching the film we weren't able to get to know many of the family members as some of them had little to no lines, I am able to conclude that the presence of 'family comes before individual needs is very present. With so much representation of the culture and family values included within the film Coco, it is no doubt that this a movie worth watching.\nConcluding Thoughts: For all of these reasons, I highly suggest that if you are looking for a good family movie, with many amazing visuals, a well developed storyline, along with the importance of family values and culture, that you give Coco a try, This movie has allowed me to immerse myself into the lives of a Latino family in a way that I don't need to know much about the culture before watching, which makes it an easy, yet enjoyable, movie to watch for all ages.", "According to the dictionary, to be successful you must accomplish an aim or a purpose. The movie Coco created by Lee Unkrich fits into this definition by supplying knowledge about the Latin music culture. From different types of music being played to covering almost all of Latin culture, the movie Coco is a very successful form of delivering information about Latin music. Fernando Gonzalez (a member of the Latin community) claims, \"Although American and Latin cultures are drastically different, they both find a way to merge together at points in order to teach others, and are successful in doing so.\" (1). This proves that no matter what type of media is spreading the culture, it is successful and delivers important information about music in the Latin culture. I believe that it is very important to include valid information that pertains to a certain culture so that your audience can learn to respect all boundaries of the actual Latin culture. In the film, the main character Miguel goes through a special journey by trying to connect with music. As the film progresses, the audience can start to see how important Latin music is to the characters. For example, in the film Miguel's family has a strict policy of no music, although Miguel states repeatedly \"I'm gonna be a musician!\". Later in the film, Miguel is in the spirit world when he is able to finally perform in front of a large audience. Everyone enjoyed him, giving him a greater reputation with music. He was so liked that the winners of the talent show which was held gave him an opportunity to meet his idol: Ernesto de la Cruz. The Hispanic passion for music is extremely powerful. From a real life source, a writer named Robin Moore explains \"From the early 40's to modern times, many Hispanics have started out without any jobs and were able to transform into very wealthy musicians\" (52). Not only is it great that people are able to succeed in this industry, but it is even better that they can spread the love for the music and to spread the passion for the music. Also, it is really great that Disney Pixar could capitalize by using the element of music in such an influential way. According to an article written by statista.com, \"Latin music is the most preferred music genre in many countries, even outside of South America into nations like the U.S., Germany, etc.\" In my eyes, it doesn't matter whether or not you enjoy Latin music. All that truly matters is the joy it spreads throughout the Latin culture, and your respect for it. There is a huge movement behind the hearts of people who are involved in the industry/culture, and these important aspects are very successfully exemplified by the movie Coco.", "The movie Coco is an animated movie based off of the Mexican culture and the day of the dead. The movie includes a lot of musical references based off of the latino culture. But are these references accurate? Does this misrepresent the Mexican culture through music?\n In my opinion, I think the songs played in the movie were very representational of the modern Mexican culture. A lot of the different songs played are based around the modern era with a lot of rustic touch, which is still used today in a lot of modern time real Mexican songs. Coco's pace and thought behind each and every song was very accurate as to how the story relates to modern day Mexican culture.\n In the movie, there is a lot of Corrido music, which is a Mexican genre that tells a story, similar to a song of American culture called, Growing Up, by Macklemore and Ed Sheeran. Arhoolie Records from American Sabor says, \"Corrido is similar to Ballad. Tales of heros set to waltz and polka rhythms performed by small acoustic bands became popular during the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century\" (1). A lot of Coco consists of storytelling songs such as Remember Me or Un Poco Loco, which are in that same format of Ballad or Corrido. The songs played both told stories such as when Hector played Remember Me to Mama Coco before he left her for good.\n In a lot of the songs in Coco, there is a good balance between instrumentals and vocals. Just about every song starts off with a strong instrumental and blends into a vocal masterpiece. Cynthia Col\u00f3n from the Latino Author writes, \"History of Latino music has exceptional rhythm and character, with a rich mixture of vocal and instrumental leads\" (1). There is a lot of different styles in the movie, but most of the songs consists of the same structure, and tempo, relating back to everything in the modern Mexican and Latino culture.\n Some people may say that to be a modern day Mexican or Latino song, it needs to be about love, or current events, or heartbreak, but in reality, there are a lot of songs today that relate nothing to those topics. Some people also might say that the songs in Coco are very stereotypical, but like I said, a song can be about anything. They can be as stereotypical or as specific as you want them to be. Carlos Quintana argues, \"Traditional and modern day Mexican Music is largely defined by a feeling of national identity that was incorporated into Mariachi Music after the Mexican Revolution\" (1). This basically means that there is more of a specific category for today's modern Mexican and Latino music, but that's not true. There are a lot of different stereotypical and specific things that can be talked about in songs. There are no defined rules.\n In the end, a lot of the music played In Coco was a very good representation of the Mexican Culture today. Sure, here and there there might be a couple of songs that don't directly relate to it, but the overall picture has good examples.", "The Disney movie, Coco, portrays a well-rounded, authentic view of the Mexican culture and one of its most important holidays, Day of the Dead. Although the representation is not 100% accurate, it gives the viewers a basic understanding of what a traditional Day of the Dead celebration would look like. For people who aren't familiar with the holiday Day of the Dead, it is said, \"During Dia de Los Muertos, families gather to celebrate life while they honor the dead, sweep graves, build special altars to honor the newly dead, and place items such as flowers, cakes, and soda next to photos of loved ones in their homes. Graveyards become the place for large parties with fruit punch and concerts.\" (\"Mexico: Holidays\" 1). Coco shows the focal point of the Day of the Dead with people creating, altars, called \"ofrendas\", with pictures that remember the lives of the loved ones that have passed. Through the eyes of the main character, Miguel, the viewers get a glimpse of a family celebrating the lives of those who have died. In the movie, it shows the family building a huge ofrenda that takes up the whole room and consists of their loved ones' images, similar to the altars that families create in real life on this holiday. Those who do not have that vitally important image on the ofrenda are not able to visit with their families. Through the Land of the Dead, it is shown that the spirits only exist beyond the grave as long as someone living remembers them. The spirits, portrayed as skeletons in the movie, cross from the Land of the Dead over to the Land of the Living on this special day and reunite with the living at the village cemetery. This shows a glimpse of the significance of the holiday, a day to remember those who have passed. Furthermore, the setting of the movie belongs in a city in rural Mexico, a place where this holiday is celebrated by many. Part of Day of the Dead is spent in the graveyard. Within the film, the graveyards are covered in bright orange flowers, foods, and more. It is like a fiesta for everyone to join in. The gathering in the graveyards shows the place of celebration for Day of the Dead. Coco shows the celebrations and fiestas that take place during this holiday. Although Coco does a good job of showing the celebrations and traditions of Day of the Dead, it did not include the different days this holiday is broken up into. This holiday takes place over the course of 3 days, starting October 31 and ending on November 2. This is further explained, \"From noon on October 31 until noon on November 1, the spirits of infants and young children who have died-called difuntos chiquitos-are said to return. The spirits of adults who have died are believed to return from noon on November 1 until the evening of November 2. This day is often called Day of the Faithful Dead.\" (Griffin 218). Coco shows Miguel's journey through the Land of the Dead; however, it does not specifically distinguish the three days and what occurs on each of those days. Coco shows the viewer a good representation of what the holiday Day of the Dead is like and its importance in Mexican culture, but it could have shown the different days that make up the holiday. By doing so, the viewer would get a thorough understanding of the holiday as a whole. Nevertheless, even without including the three different days, Coco still gave the viewer a good authentic perspective of an example of what a Day of the Dead celebration could look like.", "Overall, I feel as if the movie Coco, was an exceptional film. But, as with every movie, there are a couple downsides. The main downside that I noticed was that the cultural aspects in the movie didn't represent the proper Mexican culture. I think that the movie was great for the reason that it really shows the children watching what Dia De Los Muertos is all about. I didn't know what the holiday was until I went into highschool, but I think that since the movie teaches the kids so early about this culture/holiday, it's a great film. On the other hand, the movie isn't culturally correct. I know that children's movies are supposed to make the movie more magical and more beautiful than real life, and Coco demonstrated that. But the movie was trying to remain culturally accurate and failed.\n The first thing I noticed is that the ofrenda (altar) in the movie didn't represent what ofrendas in real life look like. In Coco, there are pictures opon pictures of family members on the ofrenda. In real life, ofrendas are not as extravagant as portrayed in the movie. From the information I gathered from David Baez, (Guerrero Baez, David, \"Mexican Culture\", English 2 class, Douglas County Public Schools, Mountain Vista High school, Highlands Ranch, CO, Guest speaker)they are simply laid out on a plastic card tables and have only has one or two pictures of family members. Or at least that is how his family celebrates. The movie ofrenda also had more food and objects that the passed relative loved. In real life, the family only puts out the sweet bread, a favorite food and one favorite object. Although the movie was very beautiful and colorful, that just isn't how it is in real life. \nAnother thing that I really didn't think was accurate about Coco, is that there are actually TWO days of the dead. The movie didn't even mention el Dia de los inocentes (Day of the innocents). According to David Baez (Guerrero Baez, David, \"Mexican Culture\", English 2 class, Douglas County Public Schools, Mountain Vista High school, Highlands Ranch, CO, Guest speaker), this day is celebrating the children that have passed that are younger than 18 years old. It's not like this day isn't equal or isn't as fun as Dia de los muertos. Because it is equal! The people in Mexico party just as hard for the children's day as they do for the other day. It really bothers me that this wasn't mentioned because it is a HUGE part of the celebration and not one thing was said about it. \n All in all, I felt like Coco was a great movie with a great story line if you aren't fully focused on the cultural accuracy of the film. By having incorrect facts in the movie, this causes confusion that might never be resolved in the viewers life. The viewers of the movie might learn the true meaning and traditions of Dia de los Muertos, but as a reviewer, I'd rather the viewers learn now.", "The movie Coco directed by Lee Unkrich was an overall good movie if you like a cute movie that has a great theme. There were many flaws about the culture but they do not impact the overall story.\nThe Latino culture has very different family dynamics. The older generations care a lot about modesty in clothing, while the children have changed to current trends. Culturegrams' experts explain, \"The kids dress more modern, in t-shirts, jeans, and tennis shoes, while the older generations like to dress formally. Women wear long skirts to cover knees, they wear capes to carry babies. Men wear long khaki pants, and short sleeves that covers the elbows.\"(1 Clothing in Latino Culture) This was very prevalent in the film with the main character, Miguel a little boy, in the more modern clothing. A red sweatshirt and khaki jeans and tennis shoes. The parents and grandparents in the more formal attire. The mom always has a waist apron, which shows that she works, but she is pregnant. \n That brings us to our next topic. Women and pregnancy. Women are supposed to have children, and lots for that matter, but there are certain things that pregnant women shouldn't do according to their culture. The experts that studied and made Culturegrams makes a great point on the latino culture. They say, \"Pregnant women should not be exposed to extreme heat, spicy food, or any type of physical activity because doing this will hinder the birthing process.\" (2 Pregnancy in Latino Culture) This didn't happen in the movie. The mother seems to be at least eight months pregnant, and she still works in the shoe business. According to the culture being in the sun and making shoes will hinder the birthing process. Although she didn't mention anything about spicy food, it was set around the day of the dead which has a lot of food. \n The food in this movie was very accurate for what the latino culture eats and brings for the day of the dead. Experts who added to Culture about food stated, \"Staple foods include corn, beans, rice, and chilis. This is combined with many spices, vegetables, and meat or fish. Candies are anywhere from sweet, to salty, to spicy.\"(3 Food in Latino Culture) This was accurate in the movie because of the food that they had on the altar. This part was really good and showed the cultural aspect.\n This movie had one more cultural aspect that was huge when it comes to latino culture. Family dynamics. The movie did a lot of misinterpreting the family dynamics. Experts who created Culturegrams argues, \"In many families,the father is the leader and provides economical support. While the and daughters are responsible for cooking, cleaning, sewing, child birthing, and care. The fathers have more dominance and bring their family to live with them when they get too old.\"(4 Family Dynamics in Latino Culture). In the movie, the roles were backwards. The grandma was the one to show discipline on the children, and the grandma's mother lives with her. If they had switched and made the grandfather (they would have to create the character) and do that stuff, I believe it would have been more accurate. \n Coco overall very good and an extremely cute movie, but we have to remember that this is a fictional movie because the movie doesn't use all the cultural aspect.", "Coco, a Disney-Pixar film about Family Importance and Day of the Dead is a spectacular movie for all ages. This movie captures Dia de Los Muertos or Day of the Dead which is involved throughout the film. After researching Dia de Los Muertos, I found that the movie accurately depicts the Mexican holiday. In this holiday they leave out offerings for their late relative or friends, and this is seen in the movie on the family's altar. Helene Henderson declares that \"Long before sunrise, people stream into the cemeteries laden with candles, flowers, and food that is often shaped and decorated to resemble the symbol of death,\" (145). In the movie they have candles, and flowers on their altar and they believe that the flowers lead the spirits back to the family altar. This movie also shows that the story is accurate in portraying Dia de Los Muertos. According to the legend, if they fail to do this then their family members are forgotten and fade from the spirit world. The movie does a good job explaining this to the viewers. An example, is when Hector's friend with the guitar fades out of the spirit world. Hector explains to Miguel that when the spirit are forgotten by anyone who knew them in their life then they fade out of the spirit world. Mexican native, David Guerrero Baez, \"Dia de Los Muertos for people who died when they were older than 18 years old\" (2 April,2018). When David came into our classroom he explained what his family has done for the Dia de Los Muertos. He stated that they put out candles and food on an altar for their family. In the movie this seen with Miguel's family, and pictures of family members are on the altar. Although Dia de Los Muertos is in the movie, there is one thing missing in the film. The film doesn't show Dia de Todos Los Santos which is basically the same holiday with a slight difference. David went on to say \"Dia de Todos Los Santos is still Day of the Dead for people who died at the age of 18 and younger\" (2 April,2018). David said that when people usually celebrate this holiday they are remembering friends. However, in some cases if someone has someone who died at that age in their family then they would celebrate both Dia de Los Muertos, and Dia de Todos Los Santos. In the film they don't show this but, this wouldn't have had a big effect on the movie. Due to the fact that all of Miguel's family died over the age of 18 and there weren't any dead kid in the spirit world. Even with the movie Coco not including Dia de Todos Los Santos, the film still captures and depicts Dia de Los Muertos vividly. This is a great movie that shows how your family is alway going to be important no matter what through Day of the Dead. I give Coco a rating of 9.5/10, as I explained above.", "The film Coco, a movie about a young Latino boy and his journey to the land of the dead during Dia De Los Muertos, resembles the true latino family structure quite well. \nAccording to CultureGrams Online Edition, \"Family unity is a very high priority, families usually act as one economic unit\"(1). This is very well represented in Coco as the family runs a shoe company and all able members of the family work for the company. This is a near perfect representation as this family is one economic unit and everyone shares in the family company's prosperity. \nAnother way that the movie accurately represents Latino Culture is through the actual household of the family. In an article written on Latino family structure, Katharine Zeiders states \"Many families live under one roof up to the grandparents\"(1). This means that grandparents, parents and children all live under one roof, or living with your first cousins as a kid. This is represented in the movie very well as Miguel lives with his parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. He also lives with his Great grandmother but as you could imagine this wasn't mentioned in the article as most people aren't fortunate enough to be alive at the same time as their great grandparents. Another thing Zeiders states is that \"Most or all of the parents major possessions are passed down to the oldest son\"(3) This is well represented in the movie as all members of the family stress to Miguel that he will be taking over the family's shoe company when he is older. \nThe only poor representation of family structure in the movie Coco is the number of children in the family. Miguel only has one sibling, a sister. This is slightly unrealistic as most Latino families have three or more children to help them make money. This however is the only issue with the film so overall it was quite accurate. \nFor this reason I would rate this film a 9/10 on cultural accuracy as there was only one minor flaw in the entire movie.", "The movie Coco in my opinion was outstanding! The cultural outlook and animations that were created, provided an amazing experience for watchers; like myself. Personally, my biased opinion is that I enjoy movies produced by Disney much more. However, this thrilling Pixar movie gave me a pleasant surprise.The Latino tradition of Dia de los Muertos is very vividly shown in Coco. The construction of the ofrenda, or altar, is one of the main important aspects of the movie. These altars are constructed in homes and graveyards throughout the county in order to feed the souls of the dead loved ones that we cherish. On these alters they lay out food for the people that have passed. In Coco, Miguel's family really demonstrated the great importance of what this cultural tradition is all about. Dia de los Muertos is about celebrating those who have passed on. It is not a day about mourning their loved ones. For example, their ancestors. There ancestors made them who they are. They gave them the genes, and had an influence on what they love and what they worship today. Like Miguel, his great great grandfather was a musician, and that's what made his love for music, it was in the DNA, even if he didn't know it. Our ancestors make us who we are. And all of the many interests and passions we have, we can thank our ancestors.However, there were a few subjects within Coco that were not explained or incorporated about the culture that they should have provided. They didn't show or explain within the film how Dia de los Muertos presents two holy days, November 1st, and November 2nd. Church officials recognize November 1st as \"All Saints Day, in commemoration of saints and martyrs. Also recognized is November 2nd as \"All Souls Day\", in memory of the faithful departed. And according to popular belief, the angelitos, or deceased children, return on the evening of October 31st, and adults on the following night. But, in Coco, they only represented one night, and on that night everyone passed through to the \"living\" side to see their living present generations. I didn't believe that these separate days were really important to put in Coco, only because then i would feel like the movie would run on. However, it is also important that the days represent different generations of ancestors, not everyone, and i feel like they could have added that somewhere in the movie.", "After some up and down efforts over the last few years, Pixar has shown the world once again that it's the master at producing original, risky and effective CGI efforts with the loveable and colourful Coco alleviating any doubts we may've started to harbor about the great animation companies ability to produce high-end original ideas.Fixating itself around Mexican culture through music and beliefs and creating a highly enjoyable incarnation of the land of the dead (filled with hybrid animals and feel good vibes), Coco follows its young protagonist Miguel as he enters unwittingly into the land of the dead on the night of the Day of the Dead celebrations as he must find his long-lost musically orientated family member to bless him back into the land of the living.It's a thoroughly enjoyable ride and one that co-directors Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina keep moving at a non-stop pace but one in which they also aren't afraid to take time out in and contemplate some emotional and poignant musings on life and what it means to be alive and to be a part of a family, delivering classic Pixar messages that feel real and relative, rather than forced and trite.It's a great mix of the fun and the serious and Coco is that rare animated film that can be enjoyed by the young and the old in equal measure and one that blends its elements together to create an experience that is likely to be remembered as one of the companies most risky and successful ventures in a CV of some incredibly well-made films.Working alongside the films unique set-pieces and foundation in a culture many outside of Mexico would fail to fully grasp is a collection of great characters and in-turn voice performances from its cast with the young Anthony Gonzalez work voicing Miguel a highlight with great supports from Gael Garcia Bernal as Miguel's Land of the Dead companion Hector and Benjamin Bratt as the singing sensation Ernesto de la Cruz.These characters might not be up there with the best of Pixar's back catalogue and Coco might not be as funny overall as some of the kings of their past but it doesn't stop this Oscar winning effort from being a league above other animated efforts from the last 12 months.Final Say -A film to be enjoyed by all ages, Coco is a likeable and affectionately made feature that will make you laugh and cry and is a stern reminder to us all that Pixar still has what it takes to be the king of the animated market.4 borrowed guitars out of 5", "Known for imagination and creativity, Pixar has transported audiences of all ages to astonishing cinematic worlds with nearly every film on its resume. \"Coco,\" inspired by Mexican culture and the aesthetic of Dia de Muertos - the \"Day of the Dead\" holiday - is another gem in its crown, a six-year passion project stunningly realized, wonderfully immersive and emotionally resonant.\"Coco\" begins with a predictably cliche family film premise but eventually evolves in unexpected ways and takes brave turns. Miguel (Anthony Gonzales) is a young boy in a family of shoemakers that for generations has sworn off music because Miguel's great-great grandfather was a mariachi who abandoned his family to pursue his dream. Naturally, music is the thing Miguel loves most; he aspires to be as great as his idol, legendary singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). When his family discovers his hidden passion during the celebration of Dia de Muertos, it goes poorly, and Miguel somehow finds himself in Land of the Dead on a quest with his dreams at stake.Pixar's trademark innovation immediately kicks into gear once Miguel moves over to the spiritual plane in which only the souls of the dead exist. He meets his ancestors and other skeletal figures, including the jovial drifter Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), and a host of brightly colored spirit animals. But as much as the Land of the Dead ironically dazzles with vibrant life, all of it is built on a foundation of family and remembrance. These souls can only existence in this world as long as they are remembered, and they can only cross into the land of the living on Dia de Muertos if their photo is on someone's ofrenda (altar).So the film's main song, \"Remember Me,\" has more powerful connotations than Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez's simple melody and sweet lyrics suggest. Director Lee Unkrich (\"Toy Story 3\") and co-director Adrian Molina weave these deeper themes into the very fabric of the film's imaginative conceit and the payoff is at least as moving if not more than \"WALL*E\" and \"Up.\"The story also isn't shy on dark notes and heartbreaking moments. There are some mature themes and a palpable sense of familial conflict, with characters who have strong values such as family or pursuing one's dreams who make poor choices despite these values and intentions. \"Coco\" sends powerful messages when these choices come to bear on the plot.Although Pixar chooses to dip back into the well of its first original creative successes a little too often, films like \"Coco\" prove that its spirit of ingenuity is alive and well. Granted, Unkrich and his team had to dig deeper, steeping themselves in a culture and new ideas in order to unearth something both original and universal. These kinds of successes may become more sparse over time as unique storytelling territory becomes harder and harder to come by, but with time and energy, \"Coco\" proves anything is possible.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more", "Oscar-winner Lee Unkrich and Seattle Film Critics Award-winner Adrian Molina seem to be consolidated as the kings of the present-day animation because, through the \"hypothetical\" inequality of years working in the field, they have achieved, in a magnificent way, to synthesize the characteristics with greater sensitivity and affinity from their previous works to use them in a plausible co-direction that allows the film to be what it is. Likewise, it was an outstanding job what they did with the general draft or/and the original story that plays a vital role for the success of the idea, in which it's possible to catch respectful and fresh reference parallelisms to certain functional aspects present in prior flicks such as the independence representation from \"Finding Nemo\", the overcoming of a specific problem in a gracefully dynamic way from \"Monsters, Inc\", and, of course, the most perceptible, an emotional and severe final message coming together harsh reality from \"Toy Story 3.\" Additional to the aforementioned two directors-screenwriters, names of the caliber of Jason Katz and Matthew Aldrich stand out in the writing for their prestige and recognition in the company, leaving, as a result, an Aldrich-Molina explosive mix that provokes the correct working of the powerhouse script. In the case of this animated feature film, death, an openly polarizing subject at present, has got a subtle, clever treatment in order to capture, in a fantastic way, the truth hiding the loss of a loved one, using accessible analogies which stir up a proactive unique masterclass in core plot idea development. About this, the whole film moves with a comfortable margin among corny drama and circumstantial comical situations that achieve, within all that unreal and hopeful context, reflect difficult and pure reality, leaning, with respect, in the ideal Mexican holiday that fits perfectly with the leitmotiv. It's clear that what makes easier the excellent final cut is the charisma and the particular essence of the story and its characters, they are pawns serving as a bridge between message and audience.Creatively, the film uses its tools in a way that exhibits the meticulous quality showed in the Pixar works. It follows the patterns of introduction and development evidenced in previous works, and although the most assiduous film buffs can feel repetitive this prototype, it's always estimable the effort to dodge the traditional through stories that transcend narrative barriers, unequivocally, through emotional scripts. While the first two acts are a complete enjoyment, the highlight is reserved for the final part because \"Coco\" has the luxury of having the second more emotionally disturbing and sentimentally dramatic climax in an animated film of the 21st century, only behind, no doubt, \"Toy Story 3\". It's overwhelming the set of emotions that an audiovisual extremely glorious moment can convey audience, one that has been fire engraved in the annals of cinema, one that will ensure the presence of hankies.The visual section is a whole other story. After a beautiful graphic simplicity coming from \"Cars 3\", the studio goes back roots and decides to bet on sharply-meticulous landscapes again, using as tools bright colors, colorful textures and confections that are going to leave you open-mouthed, maybe, that's why many film attendees come to the theaters with each new release, they're aware of the dimensions of tidiness and the labor demands that the company portrays through its continuous masterpieces. In the same way, the sound aspect excels in counted periods, however, in which it succeeds, it does it in an unbeatable way. Although it does not reach near-perfect scores as Lin-Manuel Miranda's melodies for \"Moana\" or Randy Newman's for \"Toy Story\", the film extracts what can most of these in the drama set-pieces, undoubtedly highlighting \"Remember Me\" by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, which climatizes the most powerful emotional moment in the movie. \"Coco\" by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina condenses a wide range of American cinema's strangeness and traditional elements, delivering the animated audiovisual work of the year par excellence. This enjoyable and deeply touching Magnum opus has reserved a gold place in the most prestigious movie awards, however, beyond critic acclaims or awards, its creators must feel fully fortunate that their film has gained a little piece of memory and love in the heads and hearts of millions and millions of people, perhaps, just like I did. We can breathe a sigh of relief, Disney pics keep to signify learning pillars for the growth of many people.", "I was surprised by this film because at first I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it, but I should know better than to doubt Disney's ability to tell a story. I had fun watching Coco, with its culture and beautiful music. Would it make my Top 5 Disney Films? Maybe.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Beautifully crafted and in the end very touching picture. Our hero, Miguel, has a clear stated goal: he wants to play music, which is forbidden in his family, that specializes in crafting of shoes. The beginning might feel a bit constructed (lots of exposition), but be patient and enjoy the striking colors of the Mexican landscapes, cities and people. Once the story takes us to the land of the dead (via a wonderfull bridge made of flowers) everything starts to move very quick. Both funny and moving, this is another one of those famous Pixar-tearjerkers. Yup, didn't make it without tears. again, Pixar, again!0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This interpretation of showing the idea of after life and many other hard feelings that aren't easy to explain were perfectly shown in this masterpiece, honestly.", "Summary: After a somewhat clich\u00e9 start, the movie (which is beautifully, colourfully told) keeps you hooked on the story, waiting expectantly to see what unfolds next. The tragic and emotional elements really took me by surprise, which will be all the more suprising for the targeted children's demographic. The song 'Remember Me' and what it signifies in this movie is truly moving and beautifully done, as is the message to not give up on one's family (even when that becomes rather tricky). \n_____________________________________________________________________I didn't really pay much attention when Coco was released and never bothered to watch the trailer. There wasn't too much promoting anyway, I believe. If it's a Disney movie, but not about princesses and fairy tales, I wasn't interested. It looked like just another overly colourful kids' movie, but may be set in the land of the dead etc etc. I only got interested once CinemaSins released their EWW video for this and said they really liked the movie, and I am not sorry I watched it.I went into the movie, fully expecting to be bored with the clich\u00e9s, and at first, despite the alluring glimpse into Mexican culture and way of life, I wasn't too impressed. Then came the introduction into the land of the dead which changed all that. Suddenly I was worried Miguel had died, relieved when he turned out to be ok, amazed and amused by the land of the dead, and already felt sorry for H\u00e9ctor, whose struggles, despite the comedic take, made the desperation clear.\n \nRegarding Miguel's gg.grand-father, it was neither too obvious nor too stunning. I can imagine it is really surprising for kids, however, who this movie is targeted at. At first, I thought the movie was going to reveal it was Ernesto, which it did. The moment I saw H\u00e9ctor though, I began to wonder. I never expected the darker murder twist, however. I merely thought maybe H\u00e9ctor died in poverty and sold his guitar to Ernesto in his early days. The emotional beats towards the end were also not something I was expecting and was absolutely moved by the song and what it signified.I also really liked how convincing a fan Miguel was to Ernesto, depicted by how he knows all the lines off by heart from his movies and montages. It's quite clever how that pays off when he uses that to connect the facts later.Regarding 'Family comes first', I hope the movie isn't saying Coco should have given up music, had his family insisted. Rather, that instead of walking out on them, he should keep trying to make them understand what it means to him.", "Coco - A cool concept brought to life with a lot of heart and talent, animation is very beautiful and at times cool, serving the story well and not overshadowing it, but rather complimenting it. I would be very surprised if this will not win the Oscar for the best animated picture!0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The most recent Disney-Pixar movie was released late in 2017 and it tells the story of Miguel's (Anthony Gonzalez) dream of becoming a famous musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt).His family has an old ban on music but Miguel wants to follow his dream and he ends up on the Land of the Dead, after a mysterious occurrence. There, he meets the con artist Hector (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and they both go on a meaningful journey to discover the secrets of the youngest's family history.If there is one thing that I wish my country would change it's its perspective on animated films. Basically, the overall opinion is that they are made exclusively for kids, which is why The Emoji Movie and The Boss Baby were two of the most successful movies at the last year's box office in Portugal. No parent cares about the film's message as long as it can hold their kids still for a few hours ... I am ashamed of that, especially when Coco is one of the best movies of the year!Pixar has been releasing incredible films year after year and Coco is one of the best in the most recent times. Obviously, the movie's story and its final message are what elevate it and turn it into something pretty marvelous. The screenplay is notably well-written, it is emotionally meaningful and it does not follow a conventional path. Having in mind that youngsters are, in fact, the large percentage of viewers, this is definitely not the usual \"kid-friendly\" story with cute characters and a fun adventure.Coco stands alone in relation to other Disney-Pixar films. It deals with highly sensitive themes such as life, death, spirituality and family traditions, and the characters are skeletons for most of the runtime. So, I understand if parents are afraid to take their kids to the theater if they don't know what the story leads up to. After all, a movie's appealing value is also something that should be taken into consideration when producing a film.During the first half of the movie, I struggled to understand why it was receiving so much critical praise. The first act's pacing is a bit too slow contrasting with the exciting rhythm of the second half and the score is not that impressive. Miguel's dream is to be a musician, so I expected astounding songs and the truth is that not even the Oscar-nominated song \"Remember Me\" is able to step up during this period. There are a lot of Spanish songs and I don't think it will be an easy-ride for English-speaking children. The score feels a bit underwhelming and that is probably my main issue with the film.However, this mostly applies to the first half. There is a scene midway through that changes everything and completely transforms the movie. Every minor issue that I had until that point disappeared because every single one of those problems has a reason behind it. Every action, every line of dialogue and every song. I love this unexpected moment which makes everything take a totally different meaning and launches the film to its tremendous success.The characters are extremely well-developed, their backstories have so much heart and emotion to them that I couldn't stop myself from crying at the end. I mean, it is impossible not to feel something powerful during that common scene Pixar always nails in the third act of its movies. It proves I really cared about Miguel and his journey to follow his dream, but without casting his family aside.Hector is also a fantastic character who helps Miguel to understand what is really important in life and how to balance everything out. The chemistry between these two characters elevates the story to a remarkably compelling one, filled with not only life lessons but also with tons of adventures throughout. Abuelita (Ren\u00e9e Victor) and the dog Dante are the comedy main sources and they definitely bring some needed brightness and fun to a mostly dramatic story.The voice casting is really great, all of the actors do a phenomenal job. The voices feel realistic and adequate to the characters they respectively portray. The duo of directors also achieves a great result by working with the writers to give the story the build-up it needs for that major scene as well as its necessary misdirection. The tone is very well-balanced and the screenplay has just the right amount of drama, adventure and comedy mixed brilliantly.The visuals are really beautiful, full of color and the animation is seamless. I mean, I always expect to be blown away by the realism that computer animation can bring, but Disney and Pixar are always able to surpass my already high expectations. Entertainment-wise, this film is excellent, but not ground-breaking awesome. Like I said above, this is probably the least kid-charming movie that the companies have produced since the beginning.In a perfect world, this film would be heavily shown to kids since their parents actually care about what they learn from the story, besides having fun with it. As kids, we are like a sponge, we absorb and remember everything people tell us. From what is good to what is bad, kids grow up to become someone that lived with those concepts inserted into their brains.If you take your child to watch a movie which final message is \"look at your phone more\", your kid is going to spend more time on the phone and eventually disconnect from the real world. Coco not only teaches how to deal with death but helps to understand that people are only gone if we forget them during life. As long as we remember them, they will always be with us and that is a message I want my future kids to learn and grow up with.All in all, Coco is one of the best films of the year and one of the best animated feature movies Pixar has released in the most recent years. An extremely emotional and heartfelt story, filled with life lessons and with a truly meaningful message for every viewer of any age. The animation is astonishingly beautiful, the characters are fabulous and the song \"Remember Me\" is remarkably memorable. A slow pacing during the first half is compensated with an exciting second half, but the overall score ends up being underwhelming. Besides that, some unescapable cliches here and there might lose the audience's appeal but for me, they are flawless.", "I found myself surprisingly cold towards Coco for much of its first half, and for a moment I thought the Pixar magic had faded a little. It's a film about love, life and death, all the big themes, and not just romantic love, but love of artistry and great works, touches of the same passion that saw Ratatouille become so much more than just a rat who wanted to cook and walk like a human. Yet it all seemed a little familiar; the boy who craves a career beyond his day-to-day humdrum, and the parental figures who deny him. Who could blame him? Shoe-making is hardly the stuff of daydreams, and parents never have solid concrete reasoning when it comes to shooting down fun. They might as well have pushed him into stealing that fabled guitar.That boy is 12 year old Miguel Rivera, and like any protagonist in an animated film, has come to the stage in his life where he senses his true calling in the wind. He's animated with a pudgy, oval-shaped face, and saucer-like eyes that light up whenever he sees and hears his musical idol Ernesto de la Cruz. There's even a moment that seems to be plucked straight from Ratatouille itself; Miguel reaching out to stroke an old recording of Ernesto on a fuzzy screen, the power of nostalgia compelling him to seek out his destiny. Doesn't he know to never meet your heroes?It takes all of 40 or so minutes for the meat of the story to truly begin, and meanwhile various hijinks and slapstick action sequences pave the way for Miguel's entry into the Land of the Dead on the annual day of D\u00eda de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday where spirits from past lives cross over to the living to visit their grandchildren and so on. There's a goofy, somewhat dispensable animal sidekick by the name of Dante, and most of the story's driven primarily by Miguel's selfish intentions to forge his own musical career no matter what his family might say. I can't comment with too much authority on the cultural accuracy of Coco, but most importantly it seems to have been made with lots of genuine heart and desire to capture exactly how important family is to this particular bunch, and its thematic depth is nicely backed by an wide array of Latin-American talent. Moana was an excellent start, and it's great to see that vein of cultural sensitivity continue with Coco.There's also a pretty potent motif of memory and how it is treasured throughout generations, conveyed mainly through the race to discover the real identity of a torn family portrait. This is simple visual storytelling done elegantly, but by now we're familiar with Pixar's mastery of this (just think of Wall-E's first half, which is basically a silent film). By the time the twist is finally revealed almost all of us have correctly guessed that the scruffy rascal Hector was the real ancestral muse all this time, but somehow it's moving all the same. Then you rewind and realise all the tell-tale signs that were merely setting up the big reveal, and it becomes all the more poignant: his desperation at needing to return to the living before it is too late, he and Miguel's practically flawless duet performance, and the sprinkling of a hit song that finally reveals a truer, more heartfelt purpose.Coco may not have the musical variety of The Book of Life (both excellent films in their own ways, although comparisons will be inevitable), but it does have Remember Me, which is gradually filtered down from Ernesto's bombastic stage version to the simplest of tunes in its third and final rendition. Here, it's accompanied only by the faint strumming of an acoustic guitar, and delivered through the heartbreak of Miguel, who along with the audience has finally realised its significance. It's all in the lyrics, which express how music and life are undeniably intertwined. See the final performance where both the living and the dead sway to the beat of Miguel's newfound confidence; they can't see the spirits of the past, but they know that they're there with them, in here. That old adage comes to mind, that you never really die until your name is uttered for the very last time. I think Coco, for what it's worth, will be remembered for quite some time.", "When I went to see Disney Pixar's latest release 'Coco' I didn't really know what to expect. Some cute film about a boy who likes music but whose family don't, but learns through finding his dead ancestors that family values are important too? And without doing the film an injustice, this is essentially what it is about. But it is so well done that you forget the message is so simple. Pixar has garnered a reputation for making children's films with simple concepts, both interesting and engaging to adults as well as children. Right from his 1995 debut smash 'Toy Story', which is in essence a story about a kid's toys coming to life when he's not around, director/producer John Lasseter knew the last thing he wanted to do was insult the audience's intelligence, and turned a very childish concept into an incredibly entertaining, almost edgy comedy. 'Coco' is no exception to Pixar's rule of treating the audience as if they are adults (which, let's face it, a lot of them now are). The plot is fairly simple: A 12-year-old Mexican boy called Miguel loves music; he spends a lot of time in the Plaza where the musicians all play and his hero is an old 1930s musician and film star called Ernesto de la Cruz, who came from Miguel's home town, but his family despises music. His great-great grandfather had been a musician and had abandoned his wife and daughter to pursue a career in music, leading to his wife having to start up a shoe-making business in order to support them. She also banned music from ever entering her house again. Miguel's great-grandmother, Coco, the daughter of the musician, is still alive, but suffers from (implied) Alzheimer's. This is a brave move to make in a children's film, but it treats the subject as being part of ordinary family life, embracing both the tragedy and comedy of it, without dwelling on it too much, which I really like, and I think adds depth to the film. Miguel is a likable enough hero, but cleverly the film doesn't really focus too much on him, but more on the rest of the world, and especially the adults in his life, giving it a more mature feel. The movie really starts on the Mexican 'Day of the Dead', a festival that celebrates dead ancestors, when pictures of the departed are put up on a shrine and candles lighted around them. On this day, Miguel is told by a musician he is shining the shoes for in the Plaza, to take part in the 'Day of the Dead' talent show, taking place later that night, if he wants to perform. Miguel has never played in public before, however, and so is hesitant to take part. That is until his family find he has been spending time with musicians and ban him from ever going back again, instead telling him he needs to work in the family shoe-making business. When Miguel goes to visit the shrine to his ancestors he accidentally smashes the frame of a photograph depicting his great-great grandmother Imelda, her daughter Coco, and his great-great grandfather, whose head has been ripped from the photo. When he picks up the photo, he finds that a part had been folded back that shows his great-great grandfather is holding the famous guitar of Ernesto de la Cruz. Miguel then realises Ernesto de la Cruz must be his ancestor, and he is destined to be a musician. Miguel tells them he loves music and wants to play at the talent show, whereupon his grandmother finds his beloved guitar and smashes it. This is a pretty intense scene, as it goes from being about a boy rebelling against his well-meaning family, into revealing the almost militant defence of Imelda's memory by her family. Miguel runs off to the shrine of Ernesto de la Cruz where he attempts to borrow his famous guitar in order to play at the talent show. However, because he is stealing the property of a dead man he is transported into the Land of the Dead. Here he encounters his dead ancestors who are coming to visit their family, on the one day they are able to. He is taken to his great-great grandmother Imelda, as she is having difficulty getting across to the realm of the living, because Miguel accidentally knocked her photo off the shrine. It is revealed that the dead cannot cross over to the living world on the 'Day of the Dead' if no one puts their photo up. Miguel is told he will only be able to get back home if one of his dead family give him a blessing, but it must be done before sunrise or he will be stuck in the Land of the Dead forever. Imelda offers to give him the blessing but will only do so on the condition that he never plays music again, and if he does he will immediately be transported back. Miguel runs away from his dead family also, in order to get a blessing from Ernesto de la Cruz, who he knows will not include the condition of never being able to play music. He comes across a man called H\u00e9ctor who says he used to play with de la Cruz and will help find him, as long as when Miguel gets home he will put up a photo of H\u00e9ctor, enabling him to get to the land of the living, as no one ever puts his picture up. And so ensues the main adventure of the film in which Miguel learns to appreciate his family, both living and dead, but also his family learn to appreciate music. As I say though, it is all done without insulting anyone's intelligence, and a few rather amusing Frida Kahlo jokes. Interestingly, it is also a film that warns against hero- worship, whether it be Miguel's worship of his music idol, or his family's worship of Imelda who banned music, giving the impression that neither the child or the adults are in the right or the wrong, which makes the film more interesting. As I say, rather than the focus being solely Miguel, it concentrates on the adults in his life: especially his dead ancestors, giving them all a point of view. It shows the great-great grandmother's pain at being abandoned by her husband, and her resolve to never let music ruin her family again, without completely justifying the 'cult' that Miguel's family have become to her memory. And it of course has a villain, who manages to be a 'surprise' villain enough to satisfy Disney and Pixar's latest trend of not letting them be the centre of the conflict, without losing the ability to be a genuine threat; in fact the villain's actions are surprisingly dark for a children's film but without making them unrealistically evil. The only thing is that the plot-twist is a little bit too predictable, and for quite a bit of the film I was waiting for it to be revealed, so the story could move along, but there are other twists I didn't predict so that did keep me guessing, and stopped the story getting dull and obvious. If there's one thing I would have liked to have seen it's the edgy comedy that really put Pixar on the map, the type of cultural references and nudge-wink to the audience that appears in 'Toy Story' and 'Toy Story 2' and isn't really here. The comedy is definitely more Disney standard than Pixar, but it has some funny moments and it doesn't stop it from being a good film. It does have some of the incredibly heart-warming and moving moments that Pixar does so well though, much better than Disney, as we have seen in films like 'Up' and 'Toy Story 2', and it is a film full of heart. Another thing I loved was how rich it was in Mexican culture and setting, explaining the culture enough for unfamiliar audiences to understand it without spelling it out too much, and clogging up the story. Despite it being CGI, the Mexican setting is very beautiful, and the other thing I suppose is that because so much of it is set in the Land of the Dead we don't see as much of it as I would like, but I suppose that reflects Miguel's own desperation to get home, and the Land of the Dead is well animated too, although it isn't as aesthetically pleasing as the scenes set in the little Mexican town. The music is very pretty too, with some lovely Mexican influences, and although it isn't particularly memorable, it is very nice to listen to. All in all, 'Coco' is another Pixar triumph with an engaging storyline and very memorable and relatable characters.", "The film will take you to a journey in a small town of Mexico. If you are a fan of small towns which are full of life, you will definitely fall in love with this little town of Mexico. While wandering around the streets you will discover the life, love and emotions beneath the skeleton of the town.Second thing that you would fall in love with is Mama Coco. She is a real nice old person with a uncountable numbers of textures in her face and a never ending smile on her face. But the thing that would make you feel sad about her is \"She is loosing her memories\"You would continue your journey with the small boy and music and then you would discover yourself in the Land of Deaths. A city of fantasy where all the persons of our world live after their death. Though it is the Land of the Death, you will find yourself in in a gorgeous and bright city while surfing around the city.Then a little bit of adventure with the little boy who is finding his great great grand father and who has got some unwanted relatives behind him.Finally a twist will reveal the truth about his grandfather. A journey of struggling for the love of music will end up with the message of eternal love.", "Determined to perform at a local talent show against his family's ban of music for generations, young Miguel is left without a guitar on that very day. Not willing to give up, he accidentally enters the land of the dead, where he's about to meet the greatest musician of all time. Well-hidden secrets will be unraveled, one at a time, influencing the young boy's way of thinking, for better or worse.It's a wonderful animation which introduces to the audience a world of the dead, where everyone who was remembered by somebody alive could do whatever he pleased, even cross back to the living world to take offerings from relatives. It's a plot which brings something entirely new, something unique, something which raises the action to a whole new level. The characters are also well described, complex and with a well-defined mentality, contributing decisively to the outcome. The plot is complex, full of surprises and changes of pace, making it one of a kind, as said before.The way it's animated is as you would expect, top notch, excellently portrayed and colored, with some spectacular scenes. Music also plays an important role in the picture, bringing characters together or separating others forever. It's action isn't breathtaking, but maintains a good pace throughout the movie, not letting the viewer to be distracted by anything.What disappointed me, to be honest, was the finale, which, although respects the winning formula, being happy and satisfying, leaves the impression that it is a bit too rushed. All problems seem to be resolved and all wrongs made right out of a sudden, with little explaining being done in the middle. I know that I'm too subjective about this aspect, but I was hoping for a bit more in terms of storytelling regarding the finale of a complex turn of events.Overall, what I saw was a very good animation, full of emotion, laughter, drama and good action, which told a great and complex story, but failed to maintain the extraordinary pace until the end. It's a very good movie overall, but a bit shy of other animation masterpieces.", "I took my son and his friend to see this recently and it was as excellent as the reviews had suggested.An amazing film in a long-line of animated greats, the key difference here of course is that it exposures the viewer to another culture that is not always portrayed in the best light, if at all.Its a very easy watch and is something you would happily sit through again and again.This is what happens when you set out to make a great and entertaining film that also happens to be culturally enriching without shoving it in your face.Beautifully produced and heartfelt story.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Not to be confused for another \"The Book of Life\" adventure, the team of Pixar Animation Studios has offered an eye-dropping, second main course this year after producing Cars 3. The \"ingredients\" Disney and Pixar have put together are child actor, slapstick sidekick, refreshing memories, family gatherings, colorful images, and emotions. As far as music films echo compared to \"The Little Mermaid,\" \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Aladdin,\" and \"The Lion King,\" this film reached the perfect musical height and more complex for the background and plot twist than these four.The story tells about the ambitious twelve-year-old kid, Miguel, who wanted to become a musician just like his idol, but the main conflict is his family were turned against music. Fulfilling his dream, he must rebel on the Day of the Dead celebration but stumbles into the other side of the world, the Land of the Dead. To return to the living world, he must have some music talents while learn the importance of family and its generations.The peak of the idea for the film and the worlds of the Land of the Dead was extremely ambitious with some breathtaking experiences and discovery that people drew the line or border of any place, similar like the shadows of Trump's effort to build a wall on the border. The film highly spread existential questions on how it follows between loving the families and loving the life of music of the familiar masterpieces from time to time. It would be rough to figure out what was more important than ever after witnessing the action and the emotion \"Coco\" has been carried on as a legacy similar to 2007's \"Ratatouille.\" There's a lot more than anything than everyone's heart desires. If you can recall from Disney's \"Zootopia,\" the motto is \"where anyone can be anything.\" Going back to \"Ratatouille,\" where anyone can cook.As for acting, child actor (and newcomer) Anthony Gonzalez (as Miguel) provided the most intentional, steadiest role ever for a child character, similar like Russell from Pixar's \"Up,\" after appearing two episodes from 2014's \"The Bridge\" and 2017's \"Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders.\" This was his first time leading the role as a conductor for the rest of the cast. Benjamin Bratt (as Ernesto, Miguel's idol) provided the most wonderful, beating voice than the mediocre \"Despicable Me 2\" as El Macho. Even the Mexican actor, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal is willing to save his character, the mess, and the entire family. The film was perfectly magical as it contains some sense of cartoon slapstick and humor for the film's acts. But the two most important ingredients are music and family gatherings, which are the centerpieces to the family tree and in everyone's hearts to remember the love ones, life or loss. It would brought a revitalizing moment to see and to learn from living families and deceased ones.The plot was a heartwarming, delightful taste of the original sensation like \"WALL-E,\" 'Ratatouille,\" and \"Inside Out.\" Though the film's structures are exactly similar based on \"The Book of Life\" but Pixar put more effort and eye-dropping ambition throughout the years. The direction, the writing from Pixar worker, Adrian Molina, the music, the entire cast, skeleton characters, and the background have outdone it smoothly and painstakingly. It takes a plethora of people, commitment, years, dedication, idea-makings, and hard work to put everything in one big presentation. It was over improved than \"Cars 3\" when this film have went to the finish line first. The originality was better off than \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Cars\" sequels. Fun fact is \"Coco\" director, Lee Unkrich, have pitched this idea after directing \"Toy Story 3\" and before \"The Book of Life\" got made in 2014.Overall, this film looks mighty great as a Day of the Dead and Thanksgiving treat to all families and friends. You can also watch 'The Book of Life\" before you watch this film, but under the hood, they're both as inspirational as ever. I don't understand why this film was released on Thanksgiving despite the fact this is a Day-of- the-Dead film but mainly due to box-office competition with Marvel's \"Thor: Ragnarok\" took its date. I can guarantee this film is a \"must.\" Great movie for to learn about Mexican culture, tradition and family importance. Due to positive reception, I may predict that \"Coco\" may have a slight chance of being nominated for an Oscar.As a bonus, there was a Walt Disney Animation Studios short film, Olaf's Frozen Adventure, featuring the returning characters from \"Frozen.\" Josh Gad will be brought back to life as Olaf along with Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, and Jonathan Groff. This is the first time Pixar would screened this non-Pixar short film, thought it definitely served as a holiday treat for fans. Running time for this short is 21 minutes while \"Coco\" is 109 minutes.GRADE: A+", "Let me start of by saying that as Mexican born and resident, I found this movie very respectful and honest about our culture. So, watch it without any guilt! \"COCO\" tells the history of Miguel, a music- loving boy trapped on a shoe maker family that happens to hate music for generations, this is because his great-great grandmother was left by a musician. After breaking his family rule of \"no music\" he embarks on an adventure through the world of the dead. This is Disney at its finest, a powerful movie with a powerful message, even though I found it to be more on the WDAS territory, it is clearly a Pixar trademark. I cannot speak about the voice acting in general since I watched in Spanish, but for that matter the cast was very well developed here in Mexico and they made a wonderful job on that department. Gael Garcia's did same voice as in the English version at least I can say that he did a very nice job as Hector. The only thing I didn't like about the movie (And the reason I subtract 1 star out of the 10 maximum) was the third act, which I found It to be very clich\u00e9 with a very, very old trope found in lots of movies and even regular TV shows and cartoons (I ain't going to spoil anything), but don't worry, it is compensated with the rest of the movie which I found it be very clever and emotional all the way through. And of course! As an old Disney-Pixar tradition this movie is one hell of a Tear-Jerker so don't forget to bring your tissues to the theater. I'm sure you and your family will enjoy this movie so go see it, you won't regret it.", "I've seen quite a few movies/shows set in Mexico that throw all the typical stereotypes at you. From sombreros to tacos to pinatas, it's really annoying how Hollywood thinks those are the only things that define Mexico.I knew little about Mexican culture before meeting my fianc\u00e9, who is Mexican. But after learning more about his culture, I've come to appreciate it a lot more. The foods I've tried, like mole enchiladas, chorizo, tamales, conchas, etc. have been so delicious. Their traditions, such as quincea\u00f1eras and Three Kings Day are fun. But, what I really love is how much family matters. My family was never very close, but being around my fiance's family, well, I can tell that they all love and care for each other very much. Their close knit bond is how I wish my family was. But, soon his family will become mine too, and I'm more than eager to marry into such a wonderful family.That's what I love so much about Coco. This movie is a beautiful representation of Mexican culture. Not just with the food and traditions, but with how family is important and should be appreciated. The music was enjoyable, and provides a unique soundtrack compared to the bland pop songs we get nowadays. I liked pretty much all of the characters, and couldn't find myself hating any of them. Even the antagonist. I thought his backstory was too interesting for me to hate him. Miguel is a great child protagonist, since he actually ACTS like a child. He's relatable. The kid also has a great set of pipes on him, and I imagine his voice actor has a bright future ahead of him. The animation is simply stunning, especially in the Land of the Dead. I especially love how characters ACTUALLY play the guitar instead of just strumming random strings like in most animated movies.Whether you're Mexican or not, this movie can appeal to everyone. For Mexicans, it's a great representation of their culture. For everyone else, there's a strong message about family, and the adventure the movie focuses around is both fun and exciting. I agree with most critics on how this is definitely one of Pixar's best movies yet. If you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT.", "This is such a good film. Pixar haven't been on the greatest form in recent years with a slew of sequels, but the brilliantly original and beautifully emotional Coco is exactly what makes Pixar so great. Not only is it an enormously fun and enjoyable family adventure, but it's a film with unbelievable visuals, a characterful and memorable soundtrack, as well as a whole lot of pure, heartfelt emotion that put me right on the edge of tears on more than one occasion.There's so much to love about Coco, but we'll start off with what makes it most beautiful: the emotion. Pixar have always been renowned for their ability to tug at your heartstrings (Up, Inside Out, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, need I say more?), but what they do with Coco is take the emotional side of the story to another level.This isn't so much of a sad tearjerker, but what it does bring is a truly deep and genuine sense of familial love, which plays the central role of pretty much everything that happens in the film. You may have seen the 'family is important' message before, but Coco does it in such an elegant and genuine way that you won't be able to resist feeling so closely connected to the central family here, which makes the film's plot so much more powerful and uplifting to follow, pulling you in to the point that you'll be crying tears of joy and family nostalgia all at once.Alongside the beautiful emotion that the film manages to bring about, it's also a fantastically captivating look at the festival of The Day of the Dead. Although undoubtedly well-known around the world, Coco is a film that allows you to go in knowing pretty much nothing about the festival, and explains not only its customs, but its real importance in both simple and riveting terms. It's not something I expected to gain from the film, but I really found the film's vibrant and genuine depiction of the festival and its meaning to the people who celebrate it absolutely fascinating as well.But when it comes to vibrant, there's nothing that beats the film's visuals. As I'm sure I've said in every Pixar review, the studio knows how to make jaw-droppingly beautiful animation, and Coco is yet another example of their brilliance. Above all, it's the depiction of the Land of the Dead that makes this film really sing, as the film goes about portraying the afterlife in the most colourful and energetic fashion, filling the screen from start to finish with vibrant locations and characters that all make it an absolute joy to watch.A visually beautiful film that uses as much imagination as possible to bring a fantasy world to life, Coco is arguably Pixar's most visually ambitious and successful film, with some sequences so stunning to look at that they too had me on the edge of tears (sounds like I'm a bit of a cryer \u2013 but this film really got to me).And then beyond even that, there's the soundtrack. Pixar have never really managed to pull off musicals in the same way that Disney have had eternal success with, and although this isn't a musical, it's a film with music as close to its heart as family and tradition, but it's yet another element that makes for an even more vibrant and delightful watch.With a whole range of songs that take inspiration from Mexican music, the film manages to blend musical numbers perfectly into the middle of its story, and make each song just as meaningful and emotionally captivating as fun to listen to, which really is no mean feat, and it will undoubtedly have you humming a few melodies for the rest of the day.Finally, we come to the fact that, along with all of its hugely impressive emotional depth, cultural insight, visual thrills and musical brilliance, Coco is still a kids' movie, and an excellent one at that. Although I will say its opening twenty minutes do feel a little bit too much like a generic Disney movie, once we see the change of setting to the Land of the Dead, the film bursts into life, and in tandem with its beautiful emotion, it's a really fun, exciting and even unpredictable adventure that will surely entertain kids to the full from beginning to end \u2013 it even had me on the edge of my seat with some genuinely surprising and riveting moments.On the whole, Coco is an absolute wonder of a film. It's a beautifully crafted animation that features dazzling visuals from start to finish, complete with a very characterful and memorable soundtrack, a really fun adventure story, a fascinating look at the deeper meaning of the Day of the Dead, and vivid, genuine and powerful emotion in a way only Pixar can do.", "Beautiful, the soundtrack, the history, the characters, is great. I saw the movie two times, and i cried both, and was beautiful seen grown up men crying too, the movie enters deep in your heart, is a master piece. As a Mexican, I'm very grateful for making this so respectful and beautiful.7 out of 26 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Coco is the 19th feature movie produced under the banner of the trailblazing Pixar Animation Studios and is another resounding triumph for critics and audiences alike. The four reasons that makes it so are the setting of the story, the use of original songs, the quality of the animation itself, and for telling a story with morals.The story takes place in Mexico during the celebration of the Day of the Dead when people commemorate and pay their respects to their departed ones. There are a lot of points in Mexico's culture that the writers could have chosen but choosing this colorful setting for the story really gives the movie a strong base for something fresh and original to build on with the other aspects. \nA significant aspect of the movie that is predetermined by the setting are the songs used. For the lot of movies produced by Pixar, you can note their use of original songs and how they impact much of the storytelling. With Coco, the songs feature a Mexican style for sound which adds to the movie's cultural flair. The one entitled \"Remember Me\" which won for the film the Academy Award for Best Original Song is one that will stay with you long after watching the film for sheer emotion.Coco is also an exhibition of Pixar's finest work in animation yet. Each part is a testament of the effort to capture the essence of Mexico's culture and to strike balance between expressionist artistry and capturing real life. The move manages to give a feeling of other-wordliness and at the same time almost a fluid realism.Last but not the least, if people won't buy the movie's achievements in the technical department, it would still be a triumph for the story it tells, a cross section of a vast culture that's seldom fleshed out entirely which focus on music and family. You may have caught a glimpse of the Day of the Dead in the opening sequence of the last Bond movie, Spectre and you may have thought that George Romero's zombie film of the same name is about it. But it is in this movie that the Mexican Celebration gets into spotlight on its own for the world to see. As one from another country, I applaud the makers for telling the story in the most artistic way they can without compromising the importance of the story's morals thus, continuing the Pixar tradition of responsible entertainment. Truly, it is a story that can deeply affect the audience and make the world a better place.Given that Coco excels in a lot of departments, it has downside. Despite telling a story in a unique setting, venturing to another country and showcasing another culture, some of the plot devices that drove the story have already been used in the previous Pixar Movies, that if you are one that follows closely their output you would immediately notice some scenes are play out very similar to the ones in Monsters Inc, Inside Out, Up, and Toy Story 2. Now, the makers could argue that this could be a form of Homage or a technique to imprint their signature but one can't help being alarmed about a possible diminishing of original ideas from the company that brought us out-of-the box, revolutionary animated tales such as Wall-E, Up, and the Toy Story Trilogy that captured our imagination.Though at this point Pixar seemed to have set the bar too high for itself with its latest effort, their recent outputs all together are beginning to show a formulaic approach to storytelling with frequent self-referencing and also resorting to release sequels to their originals which is not bad at all but as a moviegoer you crave something new especially with the talents and resources Pixar has.With the many accomplishments the creators have garnered with this noteworthy movie, it is good to hope that they will be able to create more imaginative, original, culturally diverse movies in the future.", "Coco (2017) \nThis is an animated fantasy adventure film produced by Pixar. It follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel Rivera, who is accidentally transported to the land of the dead, where he seeks the help of his deceased musician great-great-grandfather to return him to his family among the living. It became the highest-grossing film of all-time in the country. It has grossed over $714 million worldwide. The film received praise for its animation, vocal performances, musical score, songs, emotional story and respect to Mexican culture. It has earned numerous accolades. This is an enjoyable animated film for younger children. Still, it's a little lacking in hidden adult comedy you expect.3 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Coco's trailer seriously intrigued me. I was so interested simply because it wasn't a sequel to a pre-established Pixar IP. The last few movies from Pixar have been massive letdowns, be it the fantastic visuals but super weak plot of The Good Dinosaur, the failure to live up to the original of Finding Dory, or the complete redo/rehash of the first Cars that was Cars 3. Pick your disappoison. Get it... disappointment... poison... So Coco was the next film on the chopping block, and surely it wouldn't be that bad would it? And, it wasn't!Not to call this movie a masterpiece, because it isn't. I'll go over some negatives first. The biggest flaw I can think of is that there's too many emotional moments. Like, awesome job here Pixar! It's the first of their films since Inside Out to leave an emotional impact on me. But it starts with one heavy emotional moment, then transitions almost immediately to another heavy emotional moment that seems a bit more predictable, then another and another (etc.), and then the movie pretty much wraps up on one last emotional moment. If these moments were spread out a bit more, and not shoved in directly after one another, it would be so much more emotional. The reason the moments in Inside Out work is because A: there's time to breathe and wipe away the tears in between, and B: there's only 3 or so of them, not... 17.That's the only real flaw I could find. Now for some positives!The animation is spectacular. Before the movie played in my theater (after the obnoxious \"short\"... but that's a review for another time), there was a little thing from Pixar showing how they animated the World of the Dead reveal scene, where Miguel sees the World of the Dead for the first time. It's some really impressive stuff, and learning how it was made makes the reveal all the more impressive. Outside of that, some of the other locations, such as the big party for the singer dude, or the actual human world, all look really detailed and impressive. This is one thing Pixar has always excelled at. Even if their films aren't all that great, the animation looks stunning.Without giving away too much, the twist of the movie is very well done. It does lead into the multiple emotional moments, but it is handled very well. The resulting villain from said twist is super interesting and complex. A man who wants fame by any means necessary is a really interesting character, especially for a movie intended for a younger audience.This segways nicely into my next compliment; the characters are very memorable and interesting. I like all the dilemmas they had throughout the runtime, and all the subplots are quick to understand and wrap up quite nicely. The basic issue of Miguel's family, the \"music is a curse\" thing, is handled very very well, without going into too much heavy handed explanation. That's the one thing Pixar is consistently good at (for the most part); even if it's not a good film, it at least tells a story.There's enough humor to pull the film through the slower opening section. There's some nice humor before Miguel enters the World of the Dead, and when he does enter, there's quite a bit of humor involving skeletons, as one would expect.I don't really know what else to say. I could sing this film praises as loud as the songs it sings itself (which are all pretty darn great as well), but I think I've made my point. This film is absolutely worth seeing, and I'm really happy Pixar is finally getting their A game back on.", "Awesome movie! May not be appropriate for very young kids, as death is discussed playfully in a non-graphic way and the grandma \"Coco\" dies (nongraphic). It was a great movie though! One of the best I have seen!!!! Ratings: Quality: 8/10 Creativity 10/10 Emotionality: 6/10 (I even cried a few times!) Kid appropriateness: appropriate for children 4+. A very great movie, I highly recommend!", "Coco is a very unique phenomenon. Not only it has shown that there are still those with vision and perspective in Pixar and in general US but also has given back the true feeling of art back to the animations once more. Coco tells the tale of the most humane part of all humans, family, love and art...but very cleverly this tale takes shape around the Mexican culture and traditions. At a time that US has never been more divided on many different issues and Mecicans have been pictured all as illegal immigrants and the main causes of crimes by media, Pixar shows courage and creates a masterpiece that confronts such idiotic ideas and tries to remind all people a lot of things that they forgot, the fact that we all are the same and share the same feelings and sentiments. Unlike many movies music in Coco is not just a tool to fill the uncomfortable silences but it is the real protagonist of this story...it is present at all times and you miss it if it isn't for a second. The visual effects of the movie are incredible and stunning. Everything has been done for a purpose and every character has a role to play. It made me cry twice and to be honest it wasn't the sadness or heartbreak that caused it, I was so absorbed in how they introduced the concept of death that was overwhelming for me. In conclusion I found Coco to be one of the best movies of not only this year but of all time at least among all the other 3D animated movies.", "When i first heard about this movie, i thought how great it was to see an animated movie about mexican culture. The story however is so morbid, negative and depressing all the way til the end that the upside came up too late and short.. I dont want to spoil anything but while the look/feel of animation is amazing, this has to be arguably the worst animated story i have ever seen.9 out of 37 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Before I begin, I will say this: This is worthy of residing in its rightful place in the Pixar library.The story begins where aspiring 12-year-old Miguel Rivera wants to become a musician. However, his shoemaking family refuses such dreams and instead insists on letting him follow their long-standing work passed down for generations. Things become more complicated when he is cursed and journeys to the Land of the Dead with the help of his deceased relatives to fix the wrongs he has done.Coco does use a few familiar elements used in past Pixar films that I see them like ingredients used in making this particular movie:The aspiration of RatatouilleA hint of Inside Out's conceptThe emotional touch of Toy Story 3When blended with Mexican culture, music, and customs, including traditional beliefs for Mexico's holiday Dia de Los Muertos, it's a story worth telling when seeing it through Miguel's perspective as though we've grasped his inner psyche and are channeling it. And his meetings with various whimsical characters in the Land of the Dead offers an insight to what he's been missing and didn't know he had all along.Miguel's family felt so relatable that it's reminding me of members of my own family at a young age. Like I can literally see their personalities residing in these characters, especially kindhearted Mama Coco (who reminds me so much of my late grandmother) that it brought a tear to my eye and hushed weeping from some people that night. I'd say this feels relatable no matter who you are or where you're from because while a dream of being something greater is one thing, never forget that family is also equally important. The voice cast did an impressive job, especially newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel. Not a shred of doubt this flick will be noteworthy during award's season. This is a movie that can apply to any generation.To director Lee Unkrich and the rest at Pixar. Gracias.The moral: Cherish family. They may tell one to know their place, but it's not a crime to follow one's own path to something more life-fulfilling than initially given.", "One of two animated films that made me weep, first the grave of fireflies then this movie. I watch it with my better half, and suggest that you see this movie with your loved ones. It's not just brings up some of your memories but it's also took you there once more. And I'm agree with her, that this is indeed a really good movie.5 out of 17 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Grade: ARating: PG, 1 hour 49 minutesIn a Nutshell: This extremely vibrant, colorful animation by Pixar has heart, visually stunning effects, and celebrates a wonderfully rich Mexican culture that we rarely get to see in the movies.It will have you contemplating what happens to you and your loved ones after we die as an added inspiring bonus.If you're not familiar with Mexico's \"Day of the Dead\" holiday, you might be a little creeped out by all of the skeletons at the beginning of the movie, but by the end, you'll wish your country celebrated it too.My twin sister and I wrote a book together about how to research your family tree and celebrate your heritage.

Families ARE forever! Life goes on beyond this mortal experience. \"That's what family is supposed to do\u0085support you.\" \u2013 Miguel \"Never underestimate the power of music.\" \u2013 Ernesto de la CruzThings I liked: I adore Jaime Camil. His character is ridiculous and charming on Jane the Virgin, Season 1 (5 Discs). The colorful, stacked houses in the movie were inspired by Guanajuato in Mexico. The music is really engaging. The actual composer of the movie appears in caricature as the conductor at the end of the movie. I thought it was cool how they used the Aztec marigold throughout the movie to connect things together. It's used traditionally on the Day of the Dead for the same purpose: to connect the living with the dead. If you see this film in the theaters, you'll get to see an ADORABLE 21 minute musical short of \"Olaf's Frozen Adventure\" with characters from the movie Frozen (2013) Apparently, quite a few audiences in Mexico have complained that it's too long! Ha ha I thought it was awesome and the audience I saw with applauded happily at the end of it. It's all about families and their traditions during the holidays. Super cute. After the Frozen (2013) short, the directors of the movie COCO also talked for a minute, which is something I rarely see before a movie starts. Interesting. The beginning of the movie was clever how it told Miguel's ancestry through lacy flags. The movement of the animation was AMAZING. The details were so impressive. I watched an interview with director Lee Unkrich, who explained that they tied GoPro HERO cameras on people playing the guitar in order to get the fingers exactly right as they played. I loved the tiny details in each frame. For example, you could actually see tiny little chin hairs on Great Grandma Coco (Ana Ofelia Murguia). Voice talents include Benjamin Bratt, Gael Garcia Bernal, Anthony Gonzalez, Alanna Ubach, Gabriel Iglesias, and Latino legend Edward James Olmos.Things I didn't like: It reminded me a lot of Book of Life movie, which came out three years ago from Twentieth Century Fox. I personally liked this one more.Fun Facts: In Brazil, the name of this movie is \"Viva\", which means \"life\", because the word \"coco\" sounds too similar to the Portuguese word for \"poop.\" This film broke the record for the longest production time, because it started in 2011 and didn't hit theaters until November 2017. Merchandising has really gone big. Southwest Airlines actually painted one of their Boeing airplanes in Coco design. The Santa Cecilia graveyard in the movie is named after the Catholic saint of musicians. Dante, the dog, is named after Dante Alighieri, who wrote The Divine Comedy and also went on a journey to the world of the dead.Interesting lines: \"You don't have to forgive him, but you shouldn't forget him.\" \u2013 Miguel \"The music is not just in me. It IS me.\" \u2013 Ernesto de la Cruz \"No one was going to hand me my dream. I had to reach out and take it.\" \u2013 Ernesto de la CruzTips for parents: You'll hear the word \"chamaco\", which means \"kid.\" In some Latino cultures, it has more of a connotation of \"brat.\" The story might be hard for young children to follow. Some of the dead ancestors are a bit spooky and creepy. There are TONS of skeletons! Challenge your kids to spot the Pixar character pinatas hanging along the street in the beginning of the movie (Buzz Lightyear, Wood, Mike Wazowski). You'll also see the Pizza Planet delivery truck in another scene. I love that. A lot of Spanish words are spoken with no subtitles. You'll still understand the story if you don't speak Spanish. Here are a couple that are important to know:Mijo = Mi hijo = my sonOfrendas = offeringsThere are some \"spirit guide\" animals in the story. This is a perfect time to talk to your kids about what you believe happens to people and animals after we die. People drink alcohol. No profanity.", "In this age of hostility it's a wonder anything positive could survive social media and especially anything so well done and ambitious. It's as if the creators were somehow protected from the daily knocks we all witness or read about. But somehow they've managed to make an intensely educational film entertaining and powerfully emotional.Some of the characters are so spot on they ought to be studied in cultural classes. And the story is clever and brilliant; it's not easy to find a way to treat death and the afterlife that doesn't affect sensibilities. And it's all done in a very uplifting way without the slightest bit of resentment.I'm sure there are many who aren't interested, but for the more important group, those willing to listen, this movie is just what the doctor ordered.4 out of 13 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "As a familia, we went to see Disney's/Pixar's Coco last night at the the little Empire Cinema in Brewster.

Throughout the film the 4 year old intermittently screamed her head off terrified of the many skeletal characters. The 2 year old was either hypnotized by the visuals, or also screamed in panic as the Mom dragged the hysterical 4 year old out and then back again. (Sometimes Mom carried both out) This happened at least 5 times. Eventually the 2 year old calmed down, allowed to roll in the aisle spreading out a bed of popcorn she upended onto the aisle.On our side of the aisle we were well behaved, thanks to Tootsie Rolls an Fig Newtons.

There is an infinity of international projects that have tried to portray the Mexican culture, but in one way or another have failed miserably (some more than others), getting to see some in which we are represented even in a ridiculous and offensive . I must confess my fear that \"Coco\" would be part of this list, so I initially rejected the idea of \u200b\u200bwasting money on the ticket; but once the fear has been overcome, I have been surprised to see that from the intro of Disney, to the credits, the Mexican culture is present. I do not know if by the controversy in which he was involved or by the collaboration of Lalo Alcaraz, but the magnificent work to which Pixar has accustomed us, was pleasantly surpassed, portraying in great detail not only the mysticism that surrounds the festivity, but also other elements that are truly part of our culture (family coexistence, music, costumes, beliefs, characters, etc.). The story of a Mexican boy named Miguel who wants to be like his musical idol (Ernesto de la Cruz) even against his family, takes him to meet Hector, who becomes his companion in adventures and with whom both Miguel and us We recognize many famous people, we discover the importance of the family and the values \u200b\u200bthat identify us as people and as a nation. Although in general terms the film is worthy of being recommended for the whole family, I must clarify that some situations and ideas represented are not characteristic of that festival or have been incorporated in recent years and that the personality of some famous people has been significantly altered (I suppose with the purpose of giving a touch of comedy to the story), which is why I find it painful not to give an absolute 10. Now I understand when they qualified me with 9.9 and they told me that my work was for a 10 if not for a tiny detail, but in case the creators of Pixar read this review I will compensate them by telling our followers that if they have not gone to see it, Run to your favorite cinema! If they are Mexican they will be happy to see how they dignify our culture after so many grievances and if they are not Mexican, but want to know and understand Mexico (especially the Day of the Dead tradition) it is the most fun way to do it.", "I have always loved Pixar films (well, most of them) and was looking forward to this as an original return to form for the animation studio. It followed through on that promise and then some. Stunningly animated, culturally relevant and emotionally powerful, this animated stunner is Pixar's best film since \"Toy Story 3.\" Lee Unkrich's direction is excellent, making the film a gorgeous and stunning love letter to not only Mexico but its people and culture. The plot is thoroughly engaging throughout, and never becomes predictable despite the presence of several Pixar tropes. While some of the small children in the audience I was with got a little antsy, everyone still had a great time and absorbed the unique details of the story.Pixar's art direction is second to none in the film. The Land of the Dead is laid out as a visual wonderland, with more unique puns and Easter eggs to count on a first viewing. The all-Hispanic voice cast are uniformly great, and the film manages to be both entertaining and fun while still incredibly powerful at the same time: a nearly impossible trick to pull off in an animated film. The film's action and travel scenes are thrilling, but the movie never loses grip of its strong and hopeful message about the value of family and familial love. At the end of the day, both children and adults will love this film, which is one of the year's best. It's great to see that Pixar can still continue touch generations with animated films of exceptional quality like the ones that helped them become a household name. 10/10Note: The short film that precedes the feature, \"Olaf's Frozen Adventure,\" is a bit of a waste. It probably doesn't help that I'm not much of a Frozen fan, but it's quite long (over 20 minutes) and the songs are rather annoying.", "\"Coco\" is Pixar's latest entry to the canon of memorable animation and centers on young Miguel and his quest to find someone in the land of the dead. Passionate about music, he discovers his fire and learns who he is and where he comes from amidst this creative and fascinating world. With stunning visuals and a heartwarming story, this film stands as the year's best in animation (which stands pretty far from the rest of the year's mediocre attempts).Despite an abysmal accompanying short film, \"Olaf's Frozen Adventure,\" \"Coco\" does indeed leave its audience feeling optimistic and emotionally touched. The story is engaging form start to finish and takes many unexpected turns that deviate from a preconceived notion of the story from the limited trailers available. This makes the film overall feel fresh and original, despite the themes being repeatedly used before.As expected from Pixar, animation quality is top notch with breathtaking and intricate layers of meticulous detail and attention. It's no wonder this was a massive animated undertaking which feels like a real treat considering much of the animation released this year has been subpar at best. Every frame is delicately cared for which makes the experience that much richer.Another element many will be pleased with is the film's balance of subject matter and themes. This however, was a part lacking in my view. Its themes handle one's relationship to family contrasted with one's passion and desire which make conflict with the former. By asking a strong question from the beginning, \"Which takes precedence, family, or career?\" we are given something powerful to think and ponder throughout the film. However, this is answered but never truly explored during the second act. This felt like not only a missed opportunity but a steal away from the themes being fully explored and consequently, the payoff feeling justified.\"Coco\" through and through is quite enjoyable with a positive message for younger viewers. Despite my personal problems with the film, I would easily see it again and recommend it to practically everyone I know. It's memorable, fun, and very sincere in it's execution.", "It can't be denied that Pixar is one of the best studios of animation. Most of their movies have become classics and we all love their characters (Monster Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story, Up, etc.) But since 2010 the only great Pixar movie had been Inside Out, the rest of them being boring or unnecessary sequels that weren't so great. But with this movie Pixar is back at its best form.This movie tells us the story of a young kid who wants to be a musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz, but his family does not let him play music, so he starts a journey across the Land of the Dead in the Day of the Dead festivity to try to follow his dreams. Well, my only issue with this movie is that the basic idea of the story is not that original. I mean, a kid wants to do something, but his family won't let him, so he has to do something about it to finally reach his dreams. But the way the story is told to us is the thing that will make you forget this. It's a really beautiful story about the family, the love and the music, all with the background of the Mexican culture. About this, I have to say that Pixar exceeded my expectations. They really did a great research of every little detail of the Mexican culture and they put it into the movie with such a love and care that just for seeing all of those little details you would want to watch it a second time (in the credits you can see all the name of the families that helped in this research and that shows the interest Pixar put into it).The cast (well, voice cast was really great). From the young Anthony Gonzalez (as Miguel) to Benjamin Bratt (as Ernesto de la Cruz) or Gael Garcia Bernal (as Hector) they are all perfect in their roles and they give a special feeling to their characters that was really great and added a lot to the story. It's usual in good Pixar movies that it has really lovely characters and this is no exception. It has some really wonderfully crafted characters that you fall in love with even in a less than two hour film.The visuals of this movie are amazing (what you expect?). All the recreation of the Mexican culture is fantastic, with really colorful landscapes, and with a lot of little details full of meaning. Some shots even looked like they were real images with animated characters in it. The music is fantastic as well. There are some really beautiful songs. I especially love the song Remember Me (Recu\u00e9rdame) that appears in many different versions throughout the movie and it is really emotional. And also a special mention to the Pixar composer by excellence, Michael Giacchino (who even has a brief cameo in the movie as orchestra leader) who as usually gives the movie a lot more emotion with his beautiful melodies, bu also recreates the musical soundscape of Mexico with really funny musical tracks with guitars, trumpets and so on.I would recommend this movie to everyone. I mean, it's a movie that will touch you for sure (I cried for the final 10 minutes of the movie). It's really beautiful, with lovely characters, stunning visuals and really emotional music. What else would you want? It's Pixar at its best. I think you don't need more, so go watch it right now!", "When I started reading reviews for this movie, I was, for lack of better words, offended at the poor reviews I saw from some people. I made this account just to tell you they are wrong. Word of advice, do not listen to any of them. This movie was absolutely beautiful. An animated movie that makes me cry, and I mean actually cry, is a rarity, and this movie did just that. I don't want to speak on behalf of the Mexican people regarding the cultural accuracy of this movie, but in my opinion it did a great job of showing a beautiful tradition in a way that everyone can appreciate. Most of the bad reviews were calling it boring and predictable, but I'm convinced they are either brainless or watched the wrong movie. The twist at the end caught me completely off guard. The story was heartwarming, the visuals were beautiful, and the characters were well thought out.

Some I found dull and uninteresting, really made more for kids than a general audience, then there's movies like Coco. Simply brilliant. From the cast to the look (astoundingly beautiful in the Land of the Dead), to the music and songs. From beginning to end it was simply a breathtaking, totally absorbing, beautiful movie. Pixar should suck up a few more Oscars on this one. The one thing I could have really done without was the lame Olaf from Frozen short. Boring and uninspired, I'd rather have seen a few more trailers. But Coco is a gem in the crown that is Pixar.2 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Yeah, Pixar returns to telling classic stories of family and love in animated \"Coco\". Directors Adrian Molina and Lee Unkrich's \"Coco\" surprise with their story surrounding The Day of the Dead \u2013 Dia de Los Muertos. Vibrant images and colors amaze with texture and wonder. \"Coco\"'s state-of-the art CGI visuals alone astound. Yet, its big heart lies in the story. Molina and Matthew Aldrich's screenplay resonates forgiveness and remembrance. When Anthony Gonzalez, who voices Miguel, sings \"Remember Me\" near the end tears shall fall. The stories and memories of those we love define legacy. That makes \"Coco\" so special.Miguel's Great Great Grandfather abandoned his family to pursue his dream of becoming a musician. His great Great Great Grandmother voided the memory of her husband in photos and life, creating the family shoemaking business in his absence. She condemned all music for the family. Coco is Miguel's wheelchair bound Great Grandmother, who seems to remember very little, much less her Father.However, 10 year-old Miguel has no interest in the family business. Secretly he is the singer songwriter, who plays guitar much like his Great Great Grandfather. His dream is to perform music like his hero Ernesto de la Cruz, voiced by proud Benjamin Bratt. His music inspires Miguel.On Dia de Los Muertos the spirits of deceased family members visit their homes in the real world. These spirits who look like luminescent skeletons cross over the autumn leave covered bridge between our world and the Dead. Rather unnerving and creepy at first, this soon passes. Those forgotten in the real world become \"truly\" Dead.In \"Coco\" Miguel crosses over to the world of the Dead when he steals Ernesto's legendary guitar. He needs to find Ernesto, who might be family. If Miguel fails to return by next sunrise he shall remain there forever. Surprisingly the world of the Dead is filled with multicolored lights and life. The sights and music of \"Coco\" delight.On Miguel's journey to find Ernesto, he meets his deceased relatives including his Great Great Grandmother, who outlawed all music in the family. Miguel befriends musician Hector, voiced by whimsical compassionate Gael Garcia Bernal. As a friend of Ernesto, Hector promises to help Miguel meet him at his annual concert. Directors Molina and Unkrich create the touching bond between the two. Hector inspires Miguel to find his unique voice. While Miguel gives Hector the faith of family.In Great Great Grandmother's epiphany, she may not forgive her husband for forsaking her and their daughter to pursue his love of music. Yet she remembers him, and remembers their love. In a sense remembrance allows for forgiveness.At times \"Coco\" is loud pretty eye candy as it succumbs to the simple seek and find narrative. But the surprise reveals what you kind of know half way through. Miguel discovers his legacy and the family who loves him. Those who come before us are the possibility of love and becoming greater than we know. \"Coco\" touched my heart. Life is about love and family.", "Back in 2014, D\u00eda de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) was used as subject matter in The Book of Life, but I couldn't get pass the half hour mark. It was too kid-friendly and too contrived for my taste. I never like stories which I can map out the narrative trajectory way ahead of time. Sitting in the cinema, the first 15 minutes of Coco had me charting the story ahead of time and the dreaded feeling cascaded over me. Then, when it was least expected, the rug was pulled out from under my feet and I watched the rest of the movie with a big smile and with tears streaming down at the end, every tear was earned.Coco had some exposition to get through in the beginning and got through it did with panache and familial familiarity. The backstory is told through paper cut-outs and we learned why music is downright detested in the extended family. Though the attention to details is stunning, my mind unconsciously went down the dream-broken-dream-fulfilled road of redemption. But ever so surreptitiously Pixar surprises with a sharp turn and delivers another sumptuous piece of storytelling with Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3) holding the steering wheel.Coco possesses a kinetic charm as Miguel, excellently voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, waltzes through the Land of the Dead in a vivid sea of colours. The world building is amazingly rendered with its own internal physics and reality. It is a riot of warm hues and buoyant mariachi music, a thoroughly realised universe with skeletal figures that have real souls.The characters are all well-drawn and the voice work by the all-Latino cast is excellent. The passion is evident in full wonder and as vivid as a rose petal on snow. The Mexican culture and traditions fill the screen with authenticity and are lovingly rendered. So much is conveyed via a framed photograph on a family altar that it transcends to something else altogether. The reverence for the folks who have passed on is well-handled. When it hits the last act, my tears streamed down.Coco is no Inside Out (2015), but it is still a timely and glowing piece of work, an exploding pi\u00f1ata of colours and all shades of warm feelings. School is out, bring your kids to watch this and after that, sit somewhere nice and share about all those family members who had passed on and who meant so much to you. I think the act itself keeps them \"alive\".PS \u2013 I do feel that the trailer inadvertently let out some of twists in the story, so I would suggest not watching it if you intend to see the movie.", "Too unbelievable and unlogical, e g when dead people have big screen TVs with camera crews and the TVs can even show items out of reach for the TV crew, or skeletons with rubber-like qualities in the bone and making a sucking sound when they kiss, etc etc. Watch Hotel Transylvania instead, seems to me that's where the idea of dead people comes from but much better thought through there, and FUN.

It was bearable, bearly, for about 35 minutes.Its an embarrassment to see this is associated with Pixar. I can only imagine they were for ed to put their name on it to collect royalities.It reeks of Disney and their predictable, overly saccachrine sentiments, with an incipid story, one dimensional characters and a mismoshnof ideas about themes and subplots.As a triumph of style over substance and a nod to ersatz cultural enlightenment this is a film that can't even justify the evidence of its exostence.Visually it is a mess and a kind of over stimulated version of a little childs video game. It is devoid of humor, genuine humanist expression and superficial smattering of the Day of the Dead celebration. The characters are so flat that both \"alive\" or dead they're boring.To compare this to typical landmark, groundbreaking Pixar movies calls into question wondering exactly what people were watching during Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, etc these early films took the legendary work of early Disney animation artists and elevated it to an entirely different place.they are layered, broadly appealling, entertaining and had a touch of social context and commentary. Truly wonderful movies that deliver viewing upon viewing.The horses are out of the pen at this point but Honestly - what the hell werevthese positive reviewers watching!!??", "Day of the Dead has long been an important part of Mexican culture. On that day, people commemorate their deceased relatives. People would probably not expect Disney to release a movie focusing on this, but that's just what \"Coco\" is. It's about a boy who visits the City of the Dead, where his ancestors live. The movie has some of the most impressive animation that I've seen.One could make the argument that it's not appropriate to use an important part of another culture for a movie, but this movie makes sure to be respectful about it. We even get a depiction of a certain painter. I'd say that \"Coco\" makes up for \"The Three Caballeros\" (which was basically a big excuse to stereotype Latin America). Worth seeing.4 out of 15 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Movie \"Coco\" presents by Walt Disney Studios and Pixar Animation Studios in November 2017. I like this movie very much and it is definitely the best animation of Pixar Animation Studios in 2017. In here, I would like to express why I think \"Coco\" is a great movie and the best movie of Pixar Animation Studios in 2017.Before I start, I will tell you that don't expect me to explain thing about their visual art presentation. I don't know anything about the animation production technique, like character motion or light technique. Also, I will try my best not to spoiled.How should I start? Hmmm\u0085\u0085 How about the theme? Okay, so the movie \"Coco\" has very classical and common animation movie themes that always in favor of all, which are: love, family, friendship, faith, courage and follow your dream. I do like to point out that the movie \"Coco\" has a theme that I feel it is quite interesting that I would consider it as a not classical animation movie theme, which is remembered, and in the movie, the theme of remembering also include the themes of love and family. It is a totally perfect theme for this movie because of its connection between the movie setting, and the studios did express this theme in a way that is hard to judge out a negative common. The theme remember is connected to the setting of the movie which is the Day of the Death in Mexico.The Day of the Death in Mexico is holiday to celebrate, welcoming your dead family soul back to the living world; it is the time for family to regenerate together. In that day, people who are participate will hang up their ancestors' photo, putting the things they like and food next to the photo and memo them; it is like a memorial ceremony. This whole story is based on the traditional culture of Mexican holiday, Day of the Death. Pixar Animation Studios also does a great work on trying to let audience has a concept of the Mexican traditional culture of Day of the Death, they explain it through the movie, either 10~15 words one sentence only or conversation between people. The Day of the Death is a very inspired setting, you can create many stories with it; Pixar did create a good one.It is the first musical film that Pixar Animation Production produce. I like their music very much, it is very lively, energetic and fills with Latin-American spirit. The casts are doing really well too, I would like to point out Anthony Gonzalez and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal. They did a great job as Miguel Rivera and Hector, the leading roles (character) of this movie; they sing really well by the way.All the main character in the old human figurative movies are white, this is the first movie that Pixar ever make that cross the broader. It is more open, more international, and it is very good that they start thinking making a movie for people who share different culture. The relationship between character is quite surprising, there is no evidence in the trailer shown this relationship unless you think deep with the object in the movie.The visual art present is so well, I like the lighting very much. Also, the flower bridge that connect the living world and the death word At the last part, when Miguel sing the song \"Remember Me\" to his grandma, it makes me tear. Anthony Gonzalez (person who cast Miguel) did a great job. Also, I think the light of this scene has been produced very well, it is warm and soft; the light is very comfortable. It is amazing. Unfortunately, I cannot explain how amazing it is, but it is going to be great anyway.Recently the animation movie market is focusing on making their old movie serious. In Pixar 2013 to 2017, out of 6 movies there are only 3 movies is the new story including \"Coco\", but these three movies except of \"Coco\", they did not do really well in the gross revenue even though they are a good movie.In conclusion, \"Coco\" is a really great movie that you must not miss it. There are must more great things I can talk about. Well, I assume I lost most of the touch and hear warming feeling after two days.", "I really feel at times the hype certain movies gets on IMDb is mind boggling. Coco is overly praised is my take.The plot isn't something you have never heard or seen before. The worst part is the lack of logic. There are parts in movie where you just want to hit the fast forward button. The ending has some character to it, but it cannot still undo the boredom.I want to highlight a few reasons why this movie has no logic without exposing the plot.Most of the story is around mexicano lingo, when no way it has any impact to the plot.\nThe story has too many sideline characters who add no value to the plot.\nThe movie can be built as a 10 minute footage with proper editing. The rest is only fillerI felt this was a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of Wall-E which was equally boring excrpt the latest 30 mins", "You ever tell when a piece of art was just slopply and thrown together with NO COHESIVENESS? This is an example.Pretty weak and boring expectable story. It's saving grace is family morals at the end, but it really doesn't capture MUSIC. 1st because the music in the movie IS NOT MEMORABLE. How can you make a movie about music and the music not be LEGENDARY?And it's not like the formula is hard, find great guitarists like Paco De Lucia and others to score the film VS wanabbe composers.2 stars for having some morals, a waste of time otherwise.15 out of 88 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I had seen Book of Life which I really liked.

The one thing that hit home though is the touch of living with someone with dementia. They hit on it beautifully at the end and really wrapped the entire movie together like they have never done before.", "'COCO': Four Stars (Out of Five)Disney and Pixar's new computer-animated film about a 12-year-old music fan, despite his family's long ban on it, who accidentally enters the land of the dead, and goes on an incredible journey there. The movie was directed by Lee Unkrich (who previously helmed 'TOY STORY 3', and co-directed multiple other Pixar films), and it was co-directed by Adrian Molina. The screenplay was written by Unkrich, Molina, Jason Katz and Matthew Aldrich. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's also another big hit at the Box Office for Disney and Pixar. I found it to be visually stunning, and mostly entertaining as well.Miguel Riviera (Anthony Gonzalez) is a 12-year-old boy, who lives with his very conservative family in the small Mexican village of Santa Cecilia (a fictional village). Miguel dreams of becoming a musician, like his deceased idol Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), but music has long been forbidden in his family, due to the fact that his great-great-grandfather left their family to become a musician. When his grandmother (Renee Victor) destroys his guitar, to prevent Miguel from entering a local music contest, he breaks into a mausoleum to steal the guitar of his late idol. This causes Miguel to become a partial ghost, and enter the world of the dead. He then must team up with another ghost (Gael Garcia Bernal), that is forbidden from entering the world of the living, in order to return home. In the process of this adventure, Miguel learns a great family history lesson.The movie is definitely beautiful to look at, and the land of the dead is a great setting for a Pixar animated film (in my opinion). At least it's something different, and fresh, and the story actually has some surprise twists towards the end. The film is also mostly amusing, and it has some touching family drama, and a positive message about following your artistic dreams as well. I think as far as most animated movies go, this is definitely an above average kids film. It's worth seeing for it's visuals at the very least.", "I liked the movie so much that I am writing a movie review for the first time ever.

He was cut out entirely, and his actions as a deadbeat dad reverberated through the generations. For the last five generations, Miguel's family have been shoemakers, and abhorred any source of music. Unfortunately for Miguel he's garnered a taste for the musical, learning guitar by watching old movies of a famous singer from the town. As Dia De Muertos nears, he seeks a way to pursue his love of music, and instead finds himself transported to the land of the dead, surrounded by deceased ancestors, and starts a race against time to find his way back to the land of the living while also keeping his love of music.Pixar have never shied away from darker, more emotional themes in their movies, arguably reaching an apex with Inside Out's exploration of depression. Coco is potentially another emotional apex for the company, looking at death and family together, marrying it up with memory and Alzheimer's, and the power music holds over generations. Coco, unlike any other Pixar movie, also isn't afraid of showing death either. One of the opening scenes shows a man getting crushed by a bell, while another one later shows a man falling to the ground after being poisoned. And to turn away from these moments as Pixar usually would would've felt disingenuous in a movie all about death.Linked to this is the legacy we all leave of memory. If we can be remembered for generations, we gain immortality, but to be forgotten is to suffer a final death. This is a fate Hector starts to suffer through the movie, as his family has forgotten him, and his last living relative who knew him when he was alive also starts to forget and pass away themselves. This offers a double whammy of emotion because even though Hector is already dead, he needs to avoid being forgotten so he can stay in the land of the dead with his loved ones. And music is the solution. Music is passed down through time, is never forgotten, and means something to everyone. It's been proven to rekindle memory in Alzheimer's patients, and Coco takes this and builds an entire story around it.Coco also manages to stay true to its cultural portrayals. Much like Moana before it, Coco is as much a celebration of a culture as it is a moving, emotional story of death and memory. Not being Mexican myself no doubt much of its significance went completely over my head, but it remains respectful of Mexican traditions throughout, and even features cameos from various Mexican celebrities. Dia De Muertos means a lot to Mexicans, and so there's no better way to celebrate them and their culture than with a story revolving around that tradition.Unsurprisingly Coco is a visual treat, surpassing that of even other Pixar movies. There's so much detail in every shot, and even when deliberately cartoony, each and every character enjoys the painstaking detail that brings them to life. Mama Coco herself is probably the best example of this, appearing both as a caricature of an old woman, while also being one of the most anatomically accurate portrayals of an old woman in an animated feature. The wrinkles, the way the skin sags, the way she holds herself in her wheelchair, the blemishes in her skin, her eyes, her nose, her mouth, her hair. She just looks like anyone's grandmother. The settings and backdrops similarly enjoy an incredible amount of detail paid to them. The Land of the Dead in particular is so vibrant and full of life (heh) with lights and colours everywhere. It's depicted as a city of towers, where the new builds upon the old, all the way back to the stepped temples of the Mayans and Aztecs and up through to modern cityscapes and apartment blocks.The music is also pretty good as well, which is fortunate considering how much of the movie revolves around it as a key concept. The score by Michael Giacchino is interlaced with Mexican instrumentation like mariachi trumpets and nylon-strung acoustic guitars, but most of the emotional weight of the film comes through its original songs by Germaine Franco, and Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. The latter of which wrote the movie's most pivotal song \"Remember Me\" which is great and so versatile it's sung and arranged at least three different ways throughout the movie. In many ways the original songs make Coco feel more like usual Disney affair, and while it might not be as musically strong as Moana, it still sits at home alongside other Disney musicals.Coco is a beautiful movie for all ages and all nationalities. It speaks to everyone the world over about death and family, and remembering the ones we've lost, making it a fitting movie to watch now, around Remembrance Day. It may touch on similar plot points as other Disney/Pixar movies, but when the formula works there's no need to disrupt it when a movie like Coco comes around injecting fresh voices and concepts into it. I give it a tentative 8/10, but in time I could absolutely see it getting bumped up to a 9.

Since I do play music as well he caught my interest, but I must admit, though, that this initial set-up seemed kind of clich\u00e9d, but the execution of it is expertly done, because there is so much more put into it than just making a run-of-the-mill story of making the ones who don't like a certain thing care.Because Miguel's initial frustration about his family takes him on a wonderful journey into a beautiful world of dead people which is much more pleasant than it sounds and discovers much about his family and what family at its core means to us all. All this is made with the inspiration of the Mexican holiday Dios de los muertos (the day of the dead) which is used to honour family.There are some really strong scenes in Pixar's Coco which deal with heavy topics like death and abandonment, but it surely is handled with respect and delicacy without being dumbed down.And if you do not cry at least once during Coco, I suggest an appointment with your doctor.", "Watched it more than three times.Love the music of Mexico.

Due to the rare hit (Inside Out) or likely miss (Finding Dory, Cars 2, Cars 3, The Good Dinosaur) status Pixar has maintained in the past 5 years, I steered clear of seeing this possible disappointment in theatres. However, Coco, along with Incredibles 2 releases the following year, proved that Pixar was stepping up their game for good this time.The story follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel who's passion for music is being stifled by his relatives, who forbid music. They instead want him to be a shoemaker in the family shop. This is due to a long past family tragedy involving a musician. When Miguel is fed up with being deprived from music, he runs from home to preform in a music show. His disobedience leads him on a journey through the Land of the Dead to find his ancestor, the musician.The film shows a great understanding of its protagonist's circumstances, as Miguel is essentially unhappy apart from music. These characters, much like those of most other Pixar movies, tackle real emotions. You feel you know them on levels you wouldn't know them in, for instance, a Dreamworks movie.In the objective sense, the story of Coco is very well done and fleshed out. It was definitely a solid, intricate plot and kept the audience on edge. This movie's plot rivals the likes of Ratatouille and Toy Story, and is definitely a more complex universe.Your emotions tend to run off with Coco more than the average Pixar movie. Nothing will get those tears jerking quite like the leading single of the soundtrack \"Remeber Me\". Every song further propels Miguel's journey in such a soulful, emotional manner. You can see the effect music has on Miguel much in he same way it makes the movie. It would be a dreary Coco without the vibes put out by it's melodies.I realized how great the animation was when I saw the bridge of orange rose pedals seperating the living and the dead for the first time. The colors popped through the entire movie and produced a very Mardi Gras vibe. I really enjoyed the richness of the visuals. If you can, I recommend you see this in HD.While the renegade musician's journey doesn't quite have my vote for Pixar's best movie, it's a force to be reckoned with. If you get the chance to see it, don't pass it up.", "The movie was very inspiring. The plot was a little complicated at first, but as the movie progresses, everything starts to make sense. There is a very deep message, and emotional ending. There is a little bit of humor, and it's just a perfect blend of everything.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Definitely a kids movie, SUPER predictable, but I had a good time appreciating the fluid and fun animation of the skeleton people.

The standout aspects are its world building which is amazing, its animation which is beautiful and pleasingly colorful and its mythology which has some very interesting concepts very well explored. The film explores death so well, it is sophisticated in that theme and it is particularly effective in the portrayal of Mexican culture and D\u00eda de los Muertos. The characterization is good and I particularly loved the second act with the fantasy adventure angle to it. But even though its emotional ending was somewhat earned, it was still too sentimental. The twist is also quite easy to predict. And its major problem is the soundtrack. Remember Me is definitely a good, well utilized song, but the rest of the songs are very weak and never at all comparable to the works of Disney. And when you have a film that is literally about music, you need to have a killer soundtrack which sadly isn't the case with Coco.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I'm not an animated movie fan per se, so this one caught me in just the right frame of mind or it was indeed brilliantly done. Probably the latter because I'd have no qualms about watching it again, as it was cleverly written, very colorful and had an unusually interesting story line. Not to mention that it had enough Espanol sprinkled in to make my four years of high school Spanish appropriately worthwhile. I also enjoyed some of the traditional folk concepts introduced by the story, like the Mexican 'Dia de Los Muertos', the annual Day of the Dead Celebration, along with it's fantastical sprit creatures called 'alebrijes'. One thing you'll have to do is pay attention at the beginning of the story to understand the relationship of young Miguel to his past and present family members; we go back in time all the way to his great-great grandfather, which turns out to be one of the twists in the story. At first I was upset that Ernesto de la Cruz turned out to be a villain, but the story handled that switch perfectly and helped inspire the entire Rivera Family to love music once again. The best concept for me however was in the explanation of how the spirits in the afterworld disappeared when there was no one left alive to think about them any more. Thoughtful families would do well to take that instruction to heart to keep alive the memories and traditions of their ancestors from the past.", "I am completely shocked on how amazing this movie is.

Pixar shows great storytelling and boast their beautifully crafted animation but I never fully a big fan of them, yes they are films I loved (Up & Finding Nemo) but I never once revisit their films, it's a good watch once but except for this one.Coco speaks for the family and shows the culture beautifully . Colorful animation is what Pixar is aiming at and the characters are funny, well written and most especially memorable. The story is well-written and put a twist at the end which they sacrifice for a sudden villain of the film that needs more development,yes the story can be predicted but you never know how is it going to happen & the annoying animal is there whether you liked it or not is up to you, for me , no , they're just annoying they just put i there for comic relief but at least their is reason why he is there. The voice acting is incredible in the film never once I notice bad voice acting in the film, of course the dialogue is good and the songs are fun to listen. The film is also emotional, it brings heart and inspiration to our not just our family but ourselves too, finding who we are and what makes us a family.Pixar disappoints us with Cars 3 but they make up for it with the release of Coco, a beautifully animated, well written story, memorable character, packed with emotions & and gorgeously crafted song, showing the beauty of foreign culture and great theme about family. Pixar's latest film is what people asked for a animated film, fun for the whole family but with a message that will inspire and relate to ourselves as humans in this world sure there some flaws but it can be overlooked.", "After some recent misfires, Pixar really find its stride again with \"Coco\", a charming and beautiful tale that builds a relatable family story around the mythos of Mexico's Day of the Dead.Young Miguel longs to be a musician like his hero, Black and White Screen Idol Hector De La Cruz. Unfortunately, since his great great grandmother was abandoned by her musician husband, music has been banned by the family in favour of their shoe making business. During the Day of The Dead celebrations, Miguel is transported to the Land of The Dead but soon finds that his late family is no happier about his life choices than his living one. . . so he sets off to meet his Idol and prove his dream is valid.Initially, I was hesitant about even seeing \"Coco\". Its long gestation period allowed Guillermo del Toro to release \"The Book Of Life\" in 2014, which was film I really enjoyed. Having seen the two, despite the similarities in setting, the plots are significantly different and both are worthy of your time.My other concern also proved to be unfounded. A child lead, particularly a singing child, can occasionally prove more grating that great. Anthony Gonzalez is excellent though, aggrieved but not whiny, and his singing is accomplished without being overproduced.\"Coco\" does have a relatively predictable story, once the initial ideas have been set out. You will see the twists coming but oddly those don't always work against the film. For example, around two thirds of the way through, Miguel learns a song important in the life of his great grandmother. As soon as I saw the scene, I knew that Miguel would end up singing the song himself and I knew that it would make me cry, and indeed it did.Admittedly, it's not as funny as some other recent animated features and what humour it has is \"Family humour\" rather than jokes that work on different levels for adults and children. Also, it's oddly specific that a film for children would rely so heavily on Frida Kahlo being an integral part of it.It is, however, Pixar's best looking film. The land of the dead allows them a freedom of creativity that many of their other films don't attempt and they capture it, and contrast it with the \"real\" Mexican village beautifully.It's odd, and a little sad that Pixar will spend the next two years on sequels to their current IP's, when, Toy Story aside, they have usually just been underwhelming - compared to the successes of \"Up\", and \"Inside Out\" but until then I am looking forward to whatever original idea they come up with next.", "Coco is a film with an interesting premise and great animation, if you look at the trailer to try to decide whether to watch the film. Dia de los Muertos and a Land of the Dead fantasy storyline is really intriguing. And the Mexican holiday is something you almost never come across in mainstream films - a plus for elitists who like to think they're exploring and opening themselves to different non-Anglo cultures.Coco is a really good, enjoyable film. There's not much wrong with it, if anything. The music is beautiful, especially when Mama Imelda was singing her gorgeous song on stage with Ernesto De La Cruz, though he was being mean and swinging her around roughly.I really liked the skinny, unfortunate Hector character - and not surprisingly, it was voiced by Gael Garcia Bernal, himself a very charismatic actor. I liked the part where Hector was disappearing because no one was remembering him, and he turned his shot glass upside down. When he dressed like Frida Kahlo a couple of times, that was amusing too.The epic animation of the Land of the Dead, such as that bridge with the the golden leaf-like piles, was really stunning. The film was glowing in a very positive, technicolor, gorgeous way. The Land of the Dead wasn't some scary or somber place - it seemed fascinating, happy, and spectacular.What I liked best about Coco were the Hector parts, the magical bridge, the stunning Land of the Dead \"cityscape,\" and the animation overall.Coco is far better than some of the other major animated films of the past couple of years, like Moana, Zootopia, or Kubo.But I guess something was missing from Coco. It seems like an enjoyable way to spend two hours, and it would probably be the best of the films shown at the theater at any given time. Coco seems like it's supposed to be full of heart and soul - it was about a soulful kid wanting to pursue his love of music, and it was about familial love, too. But what is that something that's missing? Maybe its just me. Maybe I'm more fond of films that are more classic fairy tale-like, such as Frozen or Disney's Beauty & the Beast (1991). Maybe those just speak to me on a deeper level because I loved fairy tales so much my whole life. Coco is not a film I will fondly remember years to come - but maybe that's just me.Anyway, this film is definitely worth watching. It seems like it would nominated for the Academy Awards Best Animated Feature - if they don't forget about it by the end of the year. :) And maybe it will be nominated for cinematography and music, too. If you're trying to decide whether to watch, it, just go for it. Most likely, you'll enjoy it a great deal.", "I was deeply touched by This movie as a musician and a music junkie I deeply identify and project myself to Miguel as he fights to follow his dream to play music, be himself and confront the obstacles even if it meant taking consequential risks. An epic about the meaning of family, passion, standing up and the power to bring people together with music. Pixar are well known with movies that talk to the old and young demographics particularly this one, it's a fun happy movie with its dark corners for adults to decode; about the meaning of life and memory I did shed a tear at the end, this is by far one of the most stirring and heart-warming Pixar originals since Up and definitely one of my favorite animations of all time.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I am so glad that i saw the movie at an odd time, mid week and quite late in the night in a small cinema, cause i was sobbing so much near the end.

But, I grew up with every other aspects of the movie, the food, the shouting, the laughs, the loud music, the family idea, and the respect for the elders. Everything in this movie felt in place, offering 105 minutes of entertaining, but more importantly, offering tribute to Mexican Culture, today present in many places around the world, and today being violated in some other places.

Nevertheless, I don't think one should have to be to enjoy this film. Coco is a fun watch, especially because of it's main characters Miguel and Hector, as well as it's unique art style. However, I wouldn't go as far as calling it the best Pixar movie ever, yet, it's certainly up there in my opinion. Coco is an overrated film for sure. Too often are above-average films like this blown out of proportion by critics. The film sort of lacks adventure, being as the whole movie takes place over the course of one night. Miguel does travel to another realm, yet, I feel still very little of the Land of the Dead is actually explored. The story is clich\u00e9, yes, but it still manages to engage the viewer and keep them interested just enough. The families ban on music seems a little silly to me, talk about overreacting. Staying on the topic of music, I wasn't really impressed with the soundtrack for this film. I usually find myself with the songs from the movie stuck in my head but not with this one. I didn't really enjoy the songs while I was listening to them either to be honest. All in all, Coco was a positive experience. I don't watch a lot of animated films but this one looked good enough to check out and I'm glad that I did. This is a really good movie for the whole family and I praise the films ability to function as such.", "And by \"again\" I mean they used the exact same formula they've used in countless other films that either people refuse to see or they've been blinded by the whole \"it's Pixar, they do no wrong!\" So I'm sorry Pixar and Coco fans but I didn't like this! The set up is the same with practically EVERYTHING Pixar makes and everyone falls for it every time! I'm sure this thing will win a lot of awards, that wasn't even in question in a year of many lackluster animated films. But in any other year, such as last it wouldn't of faired so well up next to more powerful stories and all around better animated films.

Sad? Afraid? Regretful? Doubtful? Relieved? Maybe you'll remember your exact emotions after seeing Pixar's newest celebration of family.A young Mexican boy named Miguel lives with his mam\u00e1 Luisa and pap\u00e1 Enrique, his little sister Socorro, his aunts Carmen and Gloria, his uncle Berto, his cousins Abel, Rosa, Benny and Manny, his grandparents Franco and Abuelita, and his great grandmother, Coco, together, they're the Rivera family. The ancestors remain dear to the Riveras' memories\u2014 well, except the father of Mam\u00e1 Coco who left his family to pursue music. Today, all the Riveras, Grandma Abuelita in particular, took it to discipline anyone for touching an instrument.On the other side, a dense city houses Mexico's deceased souls alongside numerous other colorful spirit animals. When one of the inhabitants' photographs is set out by the live family members in the local cemetery on D\u00eda de los Muertos, a gate designed to resemble an immigration system gives them the okay to cross the amber leaf bridge to see their loved ones. Miguel knew them for years only through stories and photographs, and now he finally meets them in person after stealing a famous musician's guitar leaves him cursed. Miguel's ancestors include great-great grandmother Imelda, Mam\u00e1 Coco's mother, the short Pap\u00e1 Julio, the plump Rosita, the horn-eyed Victoria, and the twins Felipe and \u00d3scar; he must receive one of their blessings before sunrise, or else he will be stuck there forever.But Miguel thinks he found another way home through his musical idol, Ernesto De La Cruz, his great-great uncle from the story! He even has a way to find De La Cruz: H\u00e9ctor, a silly little man desperate to see his family again since they never once set out his photo. Then once a Shyamalan twist reveals why he wants to see his family again so bad, the true heartache comes full circle.This production proves Pixar's continually committed research, including the steps outlined in the D\u00eda de los Muertos ceremony. Especially amongst the world of the incarnate, beautiful leaves create relaxed candlelight glows, like the long celebrated fun creativity shined by the immortal hopping lamp! I'm sure it keeps accurate to Mexico's family values, since audiences in Mexico were supposedly thrilled at the premiere, taking in $28 million since its October 27th release! The same level of effort goes to the voice actors: Anthony Gonzalez gives a true, soulful performance for Miguel, his musical voice as pure as child actors come, and the right cast surrounds him with further compassionate voices, whether dead or alive.Yet once Miguel enters the afterlife, coincidences lead him to wherever the narrative takes him. Similar to what the revolutionary animation studio continues failing at, the details of the world prioritize comedy over realism. For instance, the undead skeletons drink liquor, but at the same time, say they need no bathrooms. Some other elements appear to contradict the hard research, such as English being the primary language spoken in a Mexican location. Pixar long succeeded in its widely-loved shorts without dialogue, so couldn't they expand that format to a feature length? I mean, imagine if Coco was entirely in Spanish, except speech kept to a minimum? I think it would have made the experience a lot more authentic.Looking deeper into the script's issues, the title character, Mam\u00e1 Coco, gets too little screen time to serve her plot importance justice; she just sits in her wheelchair, eyes half open, less prominent than her highest potential. The writers should have implemented the family theme further by giving each boy and girl (and dog) in the Rivera family a purpose.In full honesty, the script's issues stem from the protagonist, Miguel; he starts off whiny and selfish, in turn making his growth throughout less earned than its capacity. In fact, quite a few offensive moments seem tossed in for humor's sake, specifically a brief unnecessary scene where Miguel notices a nude portrait model (a skeleton). The depiction of Mexico's afterlife as truth rather than myth may also concern some more religious viewers. And finally, the gate used to allow Mexicans to pass through on D\u00eda de los Muertos almost parallels Trump's future vision of his wall, which could offend some more conservative viewers.Although Coco can overall still please anyone looking for a good holiday treat. These months are not always a happy time, considering the number of deaths around this time, so this special celebration of both life and death just might satisfy our hurt.", "Here's a funny story. Back in July, I remember channel surfing when I came across an ad for the awful \"Emoji Movie\". In the commercial, Sony described the film as and I quote, \"the perfect family movie of the year\" even though not a single review had been released yet. It was one of the biggest lies I have\u00a0seen so far this year. The reason why is not only because \"The Emoji Movie\"\u00a0was appalling\u00a0like I expected, but because \"Coco\" was actually\u00a0the perfect family movie of the year. After having sat through so many disappointing as well uncreative\u00a0animated movies this years, \"Coco\" came along and made up for everything. It's clear that the people of Pixar haven't lost their magic touch they had in the past because this movie is without a doubt, the year's best animated movie. This film has everything that I expect to see in an animated movie including a\u00a0emotional and creative story, rich and beautiful animation, as well as funny and memorable characters with a\u00a0nice touch of music. I'll now explain why you must see this movie.During the holiday of D\u00eda de los Muertos, a\u00a0young Mexican boy named Miguel (Anthony\u00a0Gonzalez) lives in a very strict shoe making family. The reason they are strict is because the have a longtime ban of music due his great-great grandfather, a musician left his family for the career and never returned. Though the rest of his family have nothing against the band, Miguel, on the other hand, dreams of becoming a musician and admires one of the greatest in history, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). He then makes the discovery that the musician might as well be his grandfather after discovering that in the ripped photo of him and his wife and their young daughter, is the same guitar as de la Cruz. Wanting to entering a talent show\u00a0competition, Miguel tries to borrow the guitar of de la Cruz from his grave, but accidentally ends up in the Land of the Dead itself full of hundred's of families\u00a0ancestors\u00a0who are now skeletons,\u00a0and has only until sunrise to return home before becoming a skeleton himself. With the help of a trickster skeleton named Hector (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and a street dog named Dante, Miguel must find de la Cruz in order to return to the land of the living.Words cannot describe how amazed I was at this movie. This is the very definition of a film succeeding my expectations. The story had so much creative energy put into it and was perfectly infused with respect to the Mexican culture as well as having some very emotional moments. Trust me when I say that the last few minutes of the\u00a0movie could have you crying like \"Up\", \"Toy Story 3\" or \"Inside Out\". As for the animation, it's absolutely stunning. This is one of the most beautiful animated movies that Pixar has ever put out with it's stunning colors and eye popping detail shown in the Land of the Dead and how huge and colorful it is compared to the land of the living. I also liked the look they gave the skeletons by making them not creepy as well as giving them\u00a0the ability for them to do many creative possibilities with their bones. The characters are also very fun as well. Miguel is by far\u00a0the best kid character\u00a0I've seen this year and one of the best put to film. The reason why I think he works is very simple. Unlike Arlo in \"The Good Dinosaur\", he's not annoying and has other emotions other than fear. Unlike George and Harold in \"Captain Underpants\", he's played by an actual twelve\u00a0year old boy. And especially unlike Alex in the godawful \"Emoji Movie\", he actually acts like a kid and isn't glued to a stupid\u00a0smartphone screen. The other characters are also a lot of fun and have memorable personalities. Miguel's strict family has tons of personality and even his relatives in the Land of the Dead are a lot of fun. I also like the character of Hector and his goofy antics like trying to sneak into areas by dressing up like Frida\u00a0Kahlo. And lastly, I must talk about the glorious music. Although Michael Giacchino's score delivers like usual, it's the songs written by Frozen composers Robert and Kristen\u00a0Anderson-Lopez along with\u00a0Germaine Franco and\u00a0Adrian Molina\u00a0that stand out. Although it's not a musical, the songs do have an important role in the film and are beautiful to listen to. I was initially nervous at the idea of putting these kinds of songs into a Pixar movie, but now I actually really want them to do a musical now.\u00a0I can name a lot of fun moments in this movie, but I'd rather you watch them than have me explain it.\"Coco\" is the very definition of a timeless instant classic. This was the film that this year was building up to and certainly delivered with a fun\u00a0and touching story, beautiful and stunning animation, memorable and funny characters, as well as some great music. It's certainly a film that will be remembered for years to come and honestly shows that animation isn't just for kids. There's nothing else I can say, but I loved it.", "So i think it looks great like all pixar films a fine concept wasted on a predictable, chicle scrip the voice acting was fine for most of the part but it was just so damn predictable and it just ends up as a disappointment.4 out of 19 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "To read my full review for Coco go to: www.havekidwillteardrop.comWhen I heard this movie was coming out, I was really excited to see it. My son's class had studied the Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos) in school where he learned about the history of this very important day and why it is celebrated. I was curious how Disney/Pixar would come at this because even though they always have the best intentions, some times things don't go as planned. After seeing it last night I feel like they hit it out of the park!This movie is so so full of love and color and passion. I appreciated how they explained the celebration and why it is important to people of Mexico (and beyond). The message of family, hard work and love is so strong. There is also a message of finding a way to follow your passion and if you want it you have to make it happen (although hopefully your choices will be good ones and not ones that are wrong!).The attention to detail throughout the film is incredible. When you watch various people in the movie play the guitar it is like watching a real person play. The filmmakers did their best to replicate how the fingers move and the positions they take. Attention to detail went beyond that \u2013 there is an introduction to famous Mexican heroes like Frida Kaldo and both worlds were inspired by real places the team traveled to throughout Mexico. Filmmakers collaborated with a team of cultural consultants, whose families all hail from Mexico, to weigh in on everything from character wardrobe and sets d\u00e9cor to the color palette and even dialogue\u2014encouraging a fluid blend of Spanish and English within the script in a way that required no translation. There is a long list of families in my press materials that helped with all of this as well and I felt like the film was done in such a magical yet culturally respectful way. You could really feel like this family could live next door. Or be your family.While this movie is really heart-warming there is a lot of humor too. The street dog, Dante, who Miguel befriends is hilarious and reminds me a lot of the chicken in Moana. He doesn't seem all that intelligent, will eat nearly everything, but is a loyal friend and travel companion. He might not be family, but he becomes family by the end of the film and proves that he loves as hard as Miguel. There are other fun jokes and Hector is quite a character \u2013 beloved and silly all at the same time.The voice talent in the movie is fantastic. Miguel is voiced by Anthony Gonzalez and he is wonderful. He has been playing mariachi since he was 4 years old and lends his voice to the songs his character sings.My husband doesn't really love movies that have a lot of music in them, but he felt like this had just the right amount and really loved the story line, even if it was a little bit predictable. Our son really loved it too and says all kids should see this.The directors Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina bring a really beautiful film to us and I highly recommend seeing this one with your family.Disclaimer: I was given free admission to this film. All opinions are my own and I was not required to leave a positive review. The movie is really well done!", "I wanted to like Coco because visually it was very well made, but it went on too long and had too many stories. I also didn't find most of the characters memorable. It should've been called Miguel since it was really about him. It also didn't make sense how he traveled to the undead. It was by petals, but I thought it was a dream until Coco visited the afterlife. Also, Hector the father could've told Miguel sooner that he was Coco's father. It seemed uneven.", "It was enjoyable, but certainly not worthy of the rating....

It's very perfectly appropriate for children, however.No Disney Princess on this one, it was a Prince named Miguel in a perfectly design (Modern day) fairy tale (of an original story based on a Mexican tradition) about a boy who comes from a long line of shoe makers because his great great great grandmother forbid music within the family, as it took her husband away from her, but Miguel's passion for song causes him to curse himself which takes him to the land of the dead, where he has until sundown to find the family that would give him the blessing to go back to the world of the living without giving up music.Like every good Disney Prince(cess) Miguel's journey to the underworld is accompanied by Donte a stray hairless dog that's seems to resemble a spirit animal. It's a perfect Disney formula with a lot of cultural flavor to it that makes it special.The animation was fantastic. Especially, the backgrounds that were beautiful and rich with the heritage that inspired it. It made the animation feel like a moving painting and that's the best type of animation.Ironically, the one flaw in the film is that the music is not that memorable. Considering the story is about music. I should not complain as I'm not a fan of musicals, but I did notice that no songs playing got a hold of my soul. It does not hurt that Olaf's Frozen Adventure, which accompanies the film, is filled with musical numbers and is a semi-Sequel to a movie with a song that I herd little girls rock to on their headsets (Also want to point out that Disney (but not Pixar) had a cool catchy song in Moana, performed by Dwayne Johnson (but I'm biased cause I loved the Rock).Despite this, as if you need me to tell you how great a movie by Pixar is, let me tell you anyway. This is a winner!http://cinemagardens.com", "With the holiday season here, one of the biggest themes in our society will be that of family. Whether near or far, we think of our loved ones and hopefully will be able to spend at least a little bit of time with them, celebrating another year of life, both its peaks and valleys. Along with this time comes another expected release from Pixar/Disney, and this year, it's \"Coco\".Up and coming young actor Anthony Gonzalez voices Miguel, a young man living in Mexico as El Dia de la Muerte approaches. Since this is the Day of the Dead, his family has gathered to honor their ancestors before them, as four generations of his family live under one roof, working their days away making shoes. Due to his great, great grandfather leaving the family to pursue music, the art form has been banned from the family itself even though Miguel has the gift within him. When he decides to defy his family and play in a talent show, he \"borrows\" a guitar from the grave of his hero, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), but when he plays it, he finds himself amongst the dead with his ancestors in a race against time to not only get back to the Land of the Living but also help a new friend named Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal) get to see his family and not be forgotten and lost forever.I was able to take my good friend and \"sister\" to this screening, and I think she said it best as the end credits rolled: \"Pixar and all of their feels\". There will be many people (including myself) that saw the trailer for \"Coco\" and wondered if this was The House of Mouse's version of Jorge R. Gutierrez's 2014 \"The Book of Life,\" but the setting is about where those comparisons will come to an end outside of both of these films being wonderfully enjoyable. Outside of being nothing short of gorgeous visually, there is a story that goes along with those visuals that is rich, engaging, and packed full of fun and emotion along with voice talents (which also includes Gabriel Iglesias, Edward James Olmos, and Cheech Marin) that really bring the characters to life. The themes of family, love, respect for tradition, and the need for tradition are incredibly strong here co- written by Lee Unkrich (who also directed the film) that had me laughing out loud in certain points as well as getting misty in others. Running almost two hours (which seems to becoming the norm for animated features in recent years), this is yet another example of Pixar knowing their audience and delivering on it, as the screening we attended was chock full of young'uns that were both focused and well- behaved throughout this film. There will be a short film that will be shown in some theaters that is a holiday special from the cast of \"Frozen,\" but we did not see it at our particular screening.If you are looking for a film this holiday season that is a lock for being enjoyable by each and every member of YOUR family, \"Coco\" is right up your alley. Whether it is fun for the kids as they follow Miguel's journey back to HIS family or an engaging story that the adults and everyone in between can both identify with and enjoy, this is another home run for Disney and Pixar!", "I have no clue why people liked it. I couldn't even finish the movie because it was so boring. Story is too cliche even for animation. The characters are really bad and not-relatable, especially how they were talking was super annoying. I don't think Mexicans speak like that.Graphics were good as usual but I'm still going to give 1 star, since I feel like Pixar just waisted their talented time on this piece of crap.15 out of 117 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "LIKES:The Animation: Pixar/Disney are the kings of animation, and they have proved themselves again in this CGI masterpiece. Coco's characters are dynamic, presented in so many forms that give the family a spectrum of characters. Despite a majority of the cast looking carbon copied version of skeletons, Pixar managed to inject subtle differences to make primary and secondary characters stand out. The living members also got the anatomy altered as well, going so far to represent all stage of life (i.e. old and senile, young and energetic, and even pregnant). Past designs, the movement itself is incredibly detailed. The subtle gestures in walking/running, the accurate capture of facial gestures for conversation, and more importantly the incredible finger motions of Miguel and cast playing the guitar. A statement of Pixar having incredible attention to detail wasn't kidding, because this thing was gorgeous.Spirit animals: One stand out feature of this movie are the cool spirt animals that inhabit the land of the undead. The flying jaguar, while one of the most outstanding displays, is only the tip of the iceberg, and these creatures are sprawled out in the world. I found it cool to see the creativity of blending common animals into a pi\u00f1ata like creation, each feature designed to add finesse and flare to mix and represent the culture of Mexico.The Culture: Disney movies always have a way of capturing an element of the real world. Coco's theme is all about the Mexican culture and the various customs that we as viewers only have an inkling of understanding. Pixar managed to bring that culture to life not only in design, but in the story, they have developed in this tale. Their belief in the afterlife is the foundation this tale is built on, allowing other things like soap operas, fiestas, food, and the western film culture. And within all these elements are the important customs of family, the passion of music, and the pursuit of dreams through hard work. All of these are beautifully integrated into the mix, occasionally crossing into cheesy territory, to craft a very stirring tale.The Music: By far the biggest element for me though, has to be the music of Coco. Disney is always spectacular with their soundtracks, but Coco stands out to me as one of the more unique sets of music to come out of the studio. Instead of grandiose symphonies, or Oscar designed symphonies, Coco's music is all about representing the musical culture of Mexico. Each song builds around the acoustic guitar as the primary instrument in its calm, yet vibrant strings. Such a simple instrument packs an emotional kick, especially once the supporting instruments and the voice bellow out to unleash the pent-up emotion of our characters. The songs build into the story, and are used as the primary tools for accomplishing Miguel's goals and represents a variety of artistic styles this culture has. It's dynamic, it's fun, and its relevant to the story, all big points in this reviewer's eyes.DISLIKES:The opening short: While separate, the opening number is still part of the show. Olaf's frozen adventure, while cute, was just another compilation of short songs to refresh Disney's cash cow for the last few years. Sure, some of the songs are powerful (the ending in particular), and the message tugs at my strings, but it lacked a lot of sustenance for just more songs. Thank goodness Coco's music redeemed this quality.More with the creatures: I like the spirit animals, I just didn't like how much of a background they were. With such cool concepts, you think that Disney would have found a way to capitalize on these monsters' involvement in the world whether it be searching for clues, chasing our heroes, or having more bang in the final setting. Even without their integration, the studio downplayed their powers a bit, showing inconsistencies with the potential they developed in these creatures.Lackluster Excitement: Thinking back to Pixar's previous works, there are usually those edge on the seat moments that have you questioning the fate of the heroes (Toy Story, Incredibles, even Cars). Coco not so much for me. The movie stays pretty safe, with predictable antics, calm action scenes, and a final obstacle that didn't do much for me in the suspense role. This film blows the cultural relevance out of the water, yet it still missed its potential for a complete package without the action.Many Book of Life elements: This movie stands out on its own in so many concepts and the songs are much more original. Yet, there is a lot of this movie based off of Book of Life, and in many cases less vibrant and unique than the predecessor. In my opinion, I felt the Book of Life was the more exciting of the two tales and I like this design more than the scale this one took. Still, Coco holds a lot of finesse that the Book failed to have.The VERDICT:Coco is certainly one of the more culturally relevant Pixar movies to come out of the studio. It's design and animation are gorgeous, the creativity is on point, and so much of it is packed with tasteful portrayals of this beautiful culture. Yet, it still has a few shortcomings for me to make it a perfect movie. They dropped some of the potential they built up and the excitement element could have been amped up with more struggles as well. When all is said and done though, Coco is by far one of the better films to hit the theaters this November and I strongly encourage many to flood the theaters and scope it out. And for those with little ones obsessed with Frozen, this movie is only going to be better for them.My scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5", "While Spirited Away is awesome, Coco just bored me lots. I accidentally wound up nearly watching this film when I was going to see Early Man, a film I actually like, so I was spared of this yawnfest. I can barely remember the film, except that the plot was the same as Spirited Away and that it involved the Day of the Dead. I don't mean to give Pixar harsh criticism (their animation is some of the best in the world) but I found this sooo dull.3 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I have to admit that \"Coco\" left me a little bit cold.It's got dazzling and colorful animation, and it brilliantly brings to life the land of the dead. It's also refreshing to see a high-profile animated film focused on a people and a culture (in this case Mexico and specifically its celebration of the Day of the Dead) that aren't traditionally represented in mainstream movies. But the story just didn't connect with me the way the best Pixar movies (like \"Wall-E\" and \"Toy Story 3\") do. I knew when I was supposed to cry, but I wasn't sad enough to. I'm not at all religious and I don't believe in an afterlife or think about the dead in the same way this film obviously does, so maybe that explains my rather indifferent reaction to it when others seem to be responding so strongly to it.Grade: B3 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Like most Pixar movies, the visual is great.

He is in the live world while being alive but can't be seen.More than anything, when a conflict is based on the lack of communication, it makes for a waist of 1 1/2 of time.

So bizarre this movie has such a high rating. Perhaps a 9 or even 10 for visual. Everything else is below a 5.", "Extremely colorful, touching story-line with a wonderful twist.

You can't help but see yourself in Miguel, your tias and tios in his family, and especially your abuela in his. This is one of the more developed family stories I have ever seen in a Disney and Pixar film. There are so many dimensions to the characters in Coco, the growth and development isn't reserved for only the main character. I appreciated the special attention to culture in this film, it was done so respectfully. I was engaged the entire time and most importantly so was my 3 year old (and that's an incredible feat!).

Miguel is a rebellious youth with a pure spirit who discovers who he and his family are on Dia De Los Muertos. As he learns about the past he reunites his family's memories which helps his living family grow stronger. A lot of the ideas are mature and well delivered, making Coco a movie everyone can enjoy.I'm a Southern Californian, and while Mexican culture is prevalent here, I am basically new to Dia De Los Muertos. Fortunately, the film is able to present the holiday and its traditions in an interesting and authentic feeling way. While there were times I questioned how the characters were being presented, Pixar's intentions ended up working very well by highlighting the major flaws of over-zealous adherence to ideals and energetic inquisitive naivet\u00e9.The animation encompasses huge, fantastic cityscapes, beautiful desert towns, and hip/lime-lighted parties, concerts, and studios. Objects look real as their textured surfaces distort light in motion while colorful neon spirit guides contrast the plain (even dingy) (ex)human features. Songs highlight the best action sequences with excellent vocal and orchestral performances of authentic Mexican music.Everything about Coco delivers, although I found myself anxious for more resolution at times. It's a family movie with themes that are accessible to all, but I felt it lost a little at times in order to make it kid friendly. Not enough to prevent me from giving it a full endorsement: go see, then turn up the mariachis!", "It is hard to find a movie which manages to balance story, comedy, music, and connects you to their characters. Coco has truly been one of Pixar's greatest masterpieces. It has a great story and message and it will appeal to both adults and children. I got actual goosebumps in certain moments and it really made me appreciate how much a movie can shock and move you. This was a beautiful picture and I can't do anything but recommend others to watch it because you won't regret a second of it.

After many recent dips in quality, Pixar has delivered a picture that's quite the return to form and a respectful interpretation of Mexican culture. Coco is a dazzling and emotional Mexican fairy tale with plucky characters, smart twists, lively music, and tons of fast and creative animation to back it all up. Along with Inside Out, I personally think Coco reaches the heights of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up, and all the Pixar classics prior to the company's downfall starting with Cars 2, and I hope it's regarded as a classic for years to come. I can tell Pixar poured a lot of passion and inventiveness into this one and it really shows.3 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "With 'Coco', Pixar once again proves that they're masters of storytelling. A lot of people thought this was going to be a fancier copy of \"The Book of Life\", but that's not at all the case. This one has a much more fleshed out story, with characters that the viewer grows to love and beautifully done animation. The movie starts off in a typical fashion, with the main character wanting to do something the family doesn't want him to, but the story gets interesting when Miguel believes he is related to Ernesto De la Cruz. Now you probably think you have this part of the plot figured out from what you've seen in the trailers, but Pixar pulls a \"Toy Story 3\" and \"Monsters Inc.\" on us and surprise us. The meaning behind the title of the film becomes clear towards the end of the movie and it will pull at your feels. As a Latina American, I promise my fellow Latin American viewers they will not be disappointed. Pixar really did their research and present Mexican culture in a beautiful way. They even have animated Golden age Mexican actors and actresses in \"the other side\" like Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, and I think one of them is supposed to be Maria Felix. The family is depicted in a way that will be familiar to all Latinos watching. The animation both on the living and dead worlds is beautiful. I highly recommend this one. \"The Book of Life\" is cute, but \"Coco\" is a masterpiece. Thank you so much pixar.", "I feel like a grumpy asshole for not liking this, but I just couldn't get past the terrifying premise, despite some incredibly strong animation. The style of the world of dead is indeed beautiful, with some especially stunning backgrounds. The spirit animals were a high point. However, the workings of the world of the dead are very troubling: when you die you end up not in paradise or Hell, but in a world much like our own, including extensive bureaucracy. And you continue to exist in this strange purgatory until you die AGAIN in a seemingly painful way. And there's no judgement beyond being remembered: evil men can continue to be powerful and happy in this afterlife, while good people can live in slums, which is pretty messed up.The other discomforting part of the movie is that Miguel comes from a bizarre family with a cult-like hatred of music. That's not a thing! Some fundamentalists hate certain kinds of music like rock or metal, but no one hates all music! What about hymns and choir? It's really creepy to see an entire family hate something so intrinsically tied to the human experience. I'd be interested to see how people marrying into the family handle this \"quirk.\" It's also very strange how they deify the deceased family matriarch and follow her vindictive insistence of wiping out all reference to her husband.These plot problems aside, I also found Coco to rely too much on childish antics, with lots of running and \"cute\" shenanigans. There was also less music than expected. I was also a little grossed out by the design of the dog Dante. I don't like hairless dogs in general, and this one had a tongue lolling out of his mouth at all times which is nasty. I could take this in small doses (like the dumbest hyena in Lion King), but this dog is a central character, which is tough if you hate looking it.", "Coco is the latest Pixar animated feature out in theaters that is directed by Lee Unkrich who previously worked on Toy Story 3. It tells the story of a boy named Miguel who looks up to one of his ancestors named Ernesto de la Cruz who is a famous musician. Although his family, disgusted at said ancestor's decision to pursue his musical career is completely against music, so during the Day of the Dead festival, Miguel grabs a hold of Ernesto's guitar and is transported to the land of the dead. While there, he hopes to find Ernesto and receive his blessing.There are many aspects that make this movie interesting, intense and very emotional. As the movie neared the end, for example, it built up to something emotional and sad. There were people in the theater that were crying towards the end as a matter of fact. I believe this is because of how it built its characters. Aside from Miguel, the characters all have a piece of history to them that helps to connect to the very end of the film. It feels like a lot had happened before the films even began in the present day. There was no character that I did not like which really benefits as this is a character driven story. This shouldn't come off as a surprise because Pixar is known for crafting very likable characters. (Except for you Mater) The visuals are obviously gorgeously done, and I believe it's a clich\u00e9 by this point to say that because this is a Pixar film. The scenery, especially in the land of the dead has so much detail. The way the skeletons move and behave is in a more cartoony fashion when compared to the living characters.My only real problem with the movie is that it does have some similar aspects to it to that of The Book of Life, another animated film about the Day of the Dead which came out in 2014. This has to do with the fact that both movies take place in the land of the dead, hold music as a big theme and are Day of the Dead themed films. If you were disappointed with that movie and want something more as a Day of the Dead themed film, I think you'll like that you see. Personally, I enjoyed Coco more than The Book of Life because it holds a more timeless feel than The Book of Life.9/10Before the movie would start, a Frozen short known as Olaf's Frozen Adventure would play. I personally found it to be nothing short of a corny slog and that it should have aired on television rather than in the theater.

I don't normally watch kids movies or family movies but Coco was great.

Maybe I didn't board with much faith, because people kept telling my I'd love it. But when the twist came, and I was unaware, I burst into tears.

Both the original setting and the afterlife are portrayed by this movie is gorgeous. It's filled with bright neon and pastel colours that are used superbly. Unkrich, Molina and their team outdid themselves creating this eye-popping environment and it was a definite positive to help make the movie an immersive experience. I loved how they decided to integrate that into specific ideas, like the bridge between the living and the dead being made out of flower petals. There are more than a couple visual gags with the skeletons too and to Coco's credit, I was never bored or annoyed with them even if I have seen another version of them before. There was plenty of laughter in the theatre I saw it in and I liked the gags throughout.The central conceit of the plot bugged me at the beginning. Mama Imelda's husband was a deadbeat who was selfish and abandoned his family. Why is it music's fault? If anything you think Mama would encourage emotional detachment from romantic partners instead of a hatred of music. But to the movie's credit, I got over that. They couldn't have explained it any other way without damaging the overall story so if you're like me and have a problem with this line of thinking, try to be patient and I think you'll be able to hurdle it.As animated protagonists go, Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) reminded me of Meredith from the Pixar movie Brave. You can relate to him and see why he's frustrated with how his life is going but he also comes off as selfish when we're just getting to know him. That's how I felt about Meredith but where Brave stumbled and Coco succeeds is that Coco gives Miguel great supporting characters to interact with. Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal) was easily my favourite, he's the right mix of likeable and sweet and I also really liked Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). There's a lot more to his character than meets the eye and I think they made the right choices with his magnetic musician character. As much as I was annoyed at Miguel's living family (they're largely forgettable), I also connected with his dead family and characters like Mama Imelda (Alanna Ubach). The movie could have drawn them as being nags or shallow but they take the time to help you see their point of view.The voice acting in the movie is good across the board. Anthony Gonzalez isn't the most talented singer or voice actor but he gets the job done and I think he was a good addition to the movie. Bernal and Bratt stole the show, they have great characters to work with but they helped elevate them into being memorable for me. I also have to credit Alanna Ubach for doing a solid job as well.The message of the movie is familiar (family first) but I think Coco is such a good movie that they present it in a way that it seems fresh. There is subtext about compromise and how things aren't always what they seem that I found touching. I got swept up in this movie and I think it works almost as well as many of Pixar's best movies at being emotionally affecting.I have to give the movie a backhanded compliment when it comes to the pacing. I was never annoyed with the movie but until Miguel travels to the afterlife, it did seem like it was treading water. The story was being told with care but it wasn't exciting right off the bat. Luckily, when we get to the afterlife and we start meeting Miguel's family, the movie moves at a quicker clip and you are getting so much in the way of characters and new information that Coco grabs you by the hand and you never look back.This movie felt like Pixar showing off. Not only is this one of their most impressive movies from a visual standpoint (which is no small feat) but I thought after a shaky start, the momentum picked up and they had a very sweet story about family by the end. I almost let this pass by me in theatres and looking back, I'm really glad I got the opportunity to go see it on the big screen. This is an excellent animated movie in every respect and I would urge you to give it a shot.", "I entered the theatre expecting a charming musical like Frozen. However, I experienced much more.The animation is top notch as expected from Disney animation. I found myself relating to the journey of Miguel as he tries to pursue his passion in an unforgiving family, addressing questions of life such as family, career, and passion. Pixar leaves me wondering how it was able to develop these unanswerable philosophical questions in a way that could capture and expand a child's imagination but also challenges an adult to relate and reflect.A few unexpected plot-twists adds color to this modern, funny, and sweet story. Although I'm not familiar with the part of the Hispanic culture this movie is centered around; I appreciate the undeniable creative and modern adaptation of it.An exploration of individuality, to embark on Miguel's journey but also to contemplate our own, this film is a must-see.", "Coco deals with a lot of themes while managing to go deep into sacrifices and family vs individual passions. The characters and animation is great and very fun to watch, and the plot is inventive and detailed enough to not feel bland and unoriginal.

Moreover, on the Day of the Dead, the dead can also across the marigold bridge to our world, to visit their families, provided their photos are presented on the family ofrenda.Miguel is from a household oddly at loggerheads with music, because his great-great-grandfather chooses a music career over his family, so music is the absolute taboo in the house, but after being convinced that Ernest is his great-great-grandfather, and magically yet inexplicably transferred to the Land of the Dead when he thrums Ernest's guitar in his tomb (a hiccup in the otherwise cogent and perceptive script), after the initial befuddlement, he embarks on a quest to seek the blessing from Ernest, in order to pursue a music career like him, before returning to the Land of the Living. En route, he gainsays the blessing from his great-great-grandma Imelda (Ubach), which contains a proviso that he must forswear his musician ambition, and is helped by H\u00e9ctor Rivera (Bernal), a down-in-the-luck former collaborator of Ernest, to infiltrate into Ernest's palace. In return, Miguel agrees to bring a picture of him to his daughter, whom H\u00e9ctor can finally pay his visit, and time is kicking because his nonagenarian daughter is the last one on the other side who still remembers him, if her memory of him fades away, he will meet the \"truth\" death, vanishing from thin air.The plot spiritedly darkens and thickens when Miguel somehow is in the know of what actually happened between Ernest and H\u00e9ctor and the causation of the latter's death. A twist aptly arrives just when the viewers start to get a hang of the whole picture about Miguel's genealogy, and the ensuing thrills-and-spills kickstarts like a roller-coaster with a cliff-hanger, then back to the world of the living, Miguel sings that heart-warming number of REMEMBER ME to facilitate a completely justified happy ending in both worlds.Here, what reverberates universally and poignantly in every adult heart is the well-intentional message that our memories become the linchpin of those departed in another realm, which both projects a more propitious look on death itself and inculcates the traditional family value but without condescending into homily, believe it or not, even the most hardened cynics would involuntarily shed a tear or two during its finely honed process of emotional cleansing.Visually polychromatic and aurally mellifluous (Anthony Gonzalez is a boy genius in voicing our little hero), vamped up with a miscellany of indigenous folklore staples, culture heritage and topographic features, COCO is heading to notch up that Oscar grail and emerges as another jewel in Pixar's ever-impressive crown, alas, one just cannot say the same to the cutesy Disney short OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE, ill-fatedly affixed shy of a masterpiece could simply put the former in the shade.", "The end of the 90s and the 2000s revealed Pixar as the king of CGI animation, mixing incredible visual achievements and fantastic originality into overall very well crafted entertainments. They took their time to create unforgettable pieces of film, chaining Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Wall-E, then Up, refusing the easiness of the commercial formula and, notably, sequels (at the exception of the Toy Story franchise, which holds a special place in their and their fans' heart).More recently, their track record has been tarnished by movies that were less impressive. Fans needed to start using the \"minor\" to designate Brave or Monsters University, which were already a display of weakness from the studio. Then some dared using \"boring\" when talking about Cars 2 and Cars 3, and The Good Dinosaur. And we started questioning the magic. Is it gone? Where are the masterpieces? Then they made Coco.The film is such a success as for the spectators as for the critics, and it'll almost surely get the Oscar for best animated movie. Rightfully so. Coco is Pixar getting all ambitious again. Just like Wall-E dealt with the future of humanity through the lens of a robot, Coco deals with life, family, and death through to lens of a boy. It's so incredible thoughtful, you gotta have a stone instead of a heart if it doesn't affect you. In a stream of rich, detailed and colorful visual elements, the story unfolds as an elegant and well-crafted tale sprinkled by funny jokes and goofs (yes, there is a dog!) that goes in one direction: speaking to everyone, universally.I went to the theater with 2 of my friends, guys too. To my left were two ladies who spoke Spanish and who were, judging from their reactions and laughs, picking on some details in the film from the Mexican culture (the story takes place in Mexico), and it was interesting and refreshing seeing an animated film going \"all in\" with a non-American culture like that (they already did it with Ratatouille in Paris to be fair, but the culture contrast is less strong). In the theater when you know the ending of the story is close and it's just the moment when it drops the heavy stuff, it's an exercise not to sniff or touch your eyes too much so as not to lose face with your buddies next to you, but then you hear them sniff discretely and you realize everyone in the audience is playing the same game.One of the best movie of the year and one of the best Pixar.", "This is one of Pixar's best movies even though I am not a fan of skeletons.

His family are shoemakers and music is banned in their home. Miguel wants to play music. Nothing could please Miguel if his family gives their blessing to him. When Miguel accidentally ends up in the land of the dead, he reunited with his deceased family members. Miguel goes on an unforgettable journey. The land of the dead is vibrant, colorful and alive.

An yes Coco exceeded my expectation from a just so good movie to a fantastic one! The movie was so colorful, visually appealing, and had excellent soundtracks. Not to mention the plot and twist that wrapped the pursuit of passion and the importance of family so well, and the introduction of the concept of life and death was so fun yet full of moral lessons from the perspective of Mexican holiday, Dia De Los Muertos (It made me want to visit Mexico someday). It resonated with everyone especially the ones who had lost their loved ones and memories they left behind with us. It's not Pixar if their movie don't make you weep and Coco is not an exception, it is so emotional. Coco made the whole theater (I believe) wept more than once during the movie and clapped as the credit rolled. What a wonderful movie. I'm certain Coco will get an Oscar for Best Animated Movie (And maybe best soundtrack!).Quote of the day: The final death is being forgotten", "The CGI in this movie is great . But the story line was pointless and nothing to do with Coco. It was more about the family Rivera. It's should of been called, \"Miguel\" or the \" the Rivera's\".6 out of 47 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Coco is a nice surprise from Pixar. I have seen that they had slumped with Brave, which was a poor film but they have improved since with Inside Out and then slumped again with the mediocre Good Dinosaur. I haven't seen their recent sequels such as \"Cars 2\" so I can't comment on them. Coco, I think is a pretty good film.I'm a big fan of music and that's one of the reasons why I like this film, it focuses on how a boy aspires to be a musician and he loves music. It helped me to connect with the film more because of my love for music. Though, I'm not big on Mexican culture, but this movie helped me appreciate the Day of the Dead thing. It made me want to go to Mexico on Day of the Dead to see what it's like.It has a really interesting depiction of Day of the Dead, even if it's a fantasy. It's like The Book of Life in its art and writing but it's done better.What's the problem with the film? Well, I do think it had a little too much emotion in it, it was pretty evident from the beginning. I'm not a fan of dramas so I don't like the amount of emotion this film has. Pixar is known for emotional films but they also tend to put a good amount of humor in their films, and this film didn't have much in the way of laugh-out-loud moments and it didn't have much action in it (and I also happen to like action), the action was more calmer, so that's what keeps me from rating the film very highly. I also don't like how the character of Miguel tends to lie and that he lives in a family that forbids music.This is a cute film. It's a charming Pixar film, I just could do with a little less drama and it was predictable, I also predicted in the end that the grandmother was going to die because she looked so old, like she was like 90 or 100. It's not scary or dark, I think it's appropriate for kids to watch.", "Background Story: My family and I are Mexican American so we were ecstatic when we found out Disney was finally making a film based on Mexican culture. We decided to watch this film on Thanksgiving day. They showed a Frozen short film that was 20 minutes in length that was hilarious but my mom was so confused. She thought we went to the wrong movie, she kept saying that Olaf the snowman doesn't look Mexican.Movie Review:Visuals: The visuals in this film are beautiful. It was like if the New York City skyline was engulfed by a rainbow and you were looking at the city from a distance while on acid. It was awesome.Characters: They had great characters in this film. The main character was very likable. The villain was easy to hate. The rest of the characters played their roles perfectly.Storyline: Fun story but it had some minor holes in the story. I enjoyed the twists they put inside the film.Genre: It had every genre which always makes for a great story since life is just one big story full of every kind of genre. There was comedy, music, action, adventure, horror, drama, and extremely touching moments that nearly brought me to tears. A movie is well done and impactful if it could bring such emotion out of the audience. People in the theater clapped after the movie ended, and that is generally a good sign.Themes: They had some really great themes in the film, such as the importance of family. They had adult and child humor and references so it made it enjoyable for everyone watching.I would definitely recommend you watch.", "This past summer I was given an opportunity to sit in on a feedback screening for this film. The story structure was pretty much all there but the layers-upon-layers of painstaking animation were unfinished, with large swaths of the movie being represented by little more than storyboards. It was quite an experience being able to witness just how elaborate an animated movie like Coco can be. To be able to see a literal army of artists, storytellers, engineers, animators and musicians toiling on a project partway through was like getting an exclusive tour of a new theme park months before it's set to open.So to say that the final product is almost as exhilarating as attending that screening, should be considered a testament to just how solid Coco is. As a story, as an animated comedy/musical and as an event for families whose exposure to Pixar is now a generation thick, Coco has just about everything you'd expect. It's effortlessly charming, brilliantly paced and plucks at your heartstrings like a seasoned mariachi at just the right moments. Considering that the same production studio that gave us Toy Story (1995) hasn't made a movie this affecting since Inside Out (2015) (or as I'd argue Toy Story 3 (2010)), Coco stands as a stark, defiant pronouncement that Pixar's quality bubble hasn't actually popped.Coco tells the story of a young Mexican boy named Miguel Rivera (Gonzalez) whose family's humble cross-generational contribution to their small regional town is a shoe shop and an all-consuming hatred of music. Miguel however doesn't share the same passions as his extended family and often hides away learning the gentle guitar riffs of music and screen legend Ernesto De La Cruz (Bratt). After a series of confrontations and plot reveals, Miguel attempts to steal a guitar during the town's Day of the Dead festival which curses him into an in-between state where he is neither living nor dead. To reverse the curse, Miguel recruits desperate soul Hector (Garcia Bernal) and is compelled to approach the ghost of Ernesto De La Cruz while avoiding the spirits of his dead family.As you can tell by the synopsis, the mechanics of the film's supernatural bent, how the curse works, who De La Cruz is in relation to Miguel, who Hector is, why he's helping Miguel and why the Rivera's are not big fans of music in the first place (not to mention why the movie is called Coco) are all a lot to soak in. The film swiftly covers as many of its bases as possible in the first act and drops exposition every fifteen minutes or so as to assuage audience members who can't grasp the social significance of an ofrenda.Thankfully instead of it coming across as the equivalent of explaining why the toys in Toy Story don't move, all of the complexities and contrivances are complimented by an emotional and/or a plot-focused coda. Why is Hector willing to debase himself to enter the land of the living? Because he wants to see his daughter one more time before she enters the land of the dead and he is \"forgotten\". Why does family matriarch Mama Imelda (Ubach) forbid music? Because Imelda sees music as antithetical to family unity. Even a seemingly half-cocked explanation of Alebrijes gets a punch- line that resonates, even if it takes two acts to get there.What's more the film doesn't stop to parse many of the culture- specific details, but rather lets them wash over you in a sea of color and textures. This gives audiences otherwise unaccustomed to the traditions of Dia de los Muerto the challenge of picking things up via context clues while giving audiences like myself the dopamine tickle one gets by referencing la chancla. There's a lived-in quality which is nice considering Coco could have so easily been a guided tour through Mexican cultural mythology a la The Book of Life (2014).My largest complaint remains virtually the same from when the Pixar marketing team handed out the post-movie questionnaire back in July. For a movie about family, it seems a little odd that Miguel's living, breathing family is left almost completely absent throughout the story. A few cutaways to Mama (Espinosa) and Abuelita (Victor) worrying about Miguel might have been enough to give the film a smidgen more heft, even if it were to slow Coco's zippy pace. This is not to say the last act doesn't pack one hell of an emotional, familial wallop. By the time we get to the last vocal performance, there was not a single dry eye in the theater including my own.Coco is a gorgeous, intricate and affecting animated musical-comedy whose cleverness and light touch is made all the more impressive by just how many plates are being balanced in the air. It falters only a little in regards to story and it may prove a bit slight in ambition for Pixar's growingly finicky fandom. Thankfully it makes up for it in detail and meticulously thought out world-building which proves both fun and enlightening. Check this one out for sure and bring the entire family.", "The CGI is really amazing, but that's about all that I like. The plot is the same story we've seen so many times before.Character likes something their family, society, friends don't like. The character eventually goes through something and everyone that hated said thing like it now.This film is also quite morbid when you think about it. All these walking skeletons? In a kid's movie?

Is it the companies' latest crowning achievement? No, but it's still a solid flick worth watching with beautiful music, charming characters, gorgeous animation and a well rounded message about family.The way the movie establishes the heart of Mexican music is brilliant, and directors Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina drive Mexican iconography and music to new heights. The small town our main hero Miguel and the Rivera family resides in feels genuine, complete with several possible in-jokes and cultural nods Mexican natives may find amusing. As for the Rivera family, their history is set up well as the story's central conflict. This is what makes the main protagonist Miguel worth rooting for as we understand his dreams in spite of what his family thinks and wish for him to succeed.On top of that, the animation is the usual Pixar glory, as it looks vibrant, bright, and crystal clear. Alongside the familiar Pixar character designs, the Land of the Dead that Miguel ends up in contains so much detail and whimsy that even the smallest details are worth praising.And then there are the musical numbers, which range from upbeat to downright heart wrenching. Not only do the songs give the characters a chance to shine, along with some neat choreography, but most if not all of them serve the stories' main theme of never forgetting those you once loved. The best contributor is Remember Me, which I hope is at least nominated for an Oscar.As for the other characters, the best out of all of them is the skeleton Hector who accompanies Miguel on his journey. While the team up trope has been done in Pixar many times, the filmmakers add some more layers to the skeleton than his bones. Not to mention, the way he walks and moves is nothing short of accurate and cute with how his bones jangle. Most of the other characters aren't worth talking about, as they can range from obstacles for Miguel to just background characters.In terms of negatives, Coco does follow a rather predictable storyline and it's not hard to figure out what might happen, but on the other hand the film does add some unique elements here and there to keep the audience invested. To quote Stefan Ellison of the Scene Magaizine, \"The climax also seems to create multiple conclusions, stretching it out with one obvious trick after another.\" Also, there is a Deus ex Machina in this film...then again, any movie has that, so why am I surprised?Overall, while it has its predictable story tropes, Coco is still a well done entry into Pixar's catalogue with its lavish animation, breathtaking songs, fun characters, and great message about family. Even if you have your fair share of family members you don't like, you shouldn't forget them entirely because there's a good chance they may have shaped your life for the better. Remember that, and enjoy this movie for its musical wonder and sense of adventure with that message mixed in.", "As said in the title only having 7 songs in a musical movie is extremely low let alone a musical movie ABOUT MUSIC. Any ways it had average twists but terrible character motivation. At the end why was the grandma so easily calmed during the closing song to the great grandma in contrast to her having a full out roid rage before. Also the plot is weak and far fetched, the excuse that \"its a kids movie\" is just an excuse for lazy writing that could have easily been something believable. So enjoyable if they are 5 but 5 year olds like anything colorful so that holds no merit", "When Coco won the award for best cartoon at the Oscars earlier this year, many people agreed that Pixar was on the right track after the failure that was The Good Dinosaur. This movie pays homage to the culture of Mexico's Day of the Dead and there's lots of memorable songs like \"Remember Me\" and a colorful look to the film.

The man in the center of its production is Lee Unkrich, an Oscar winner for Toy Story 3 already. But in this 105-minute film here, we follow a boy and his passion for music that leads him down to the land of the dead even. The general plot idea of the whole family hating music because of what happened generations ago was maybe my only problem with the film. It does not feel too realistic. But everything else is fine. Music maybe could have been a bit better, but I watched the German dub, so maybe it is better in the English (with a bit of Spanish) original. I personally also felt that the film is always really more about the characters next to the boy than about the boy himself despite his deep-rooted connection with them. The dog, the fella with the hat and of course the fact that a child is in the center of it all (even if not the title character) makes it a good watch for kids too, but as a whole I believe, it is more of a film for grown-ups given the subject of death and several serious references. Early on, I struggled a bit with the fading away reference, basically a second death, but the way they included it then afterward was handled pretty nicely.I think that everything before the meeting with Ernesto eventually could have been a bit shorter and less, but the final 30-40 minutes really make up for it immensely. This is where the film really gains steam and the main, if not the only, reason I give it a ****/***** and include it in my best-of-2017 list. They really did a smart job there in making us forget about some dragging and mediocrity from early on. Still it's far from a perfect movie. The part about these normal animals transforming into mythical creatures like Dante could have been presented more interestingly and the film could have been better in terms of elaborating on the difference between forgiving and forgetting, a crucial reference in the final chapter. Still with all they do eventually, it becomes a very touching ending and film as a consequence and I must say I liked it a lot and I am glad if it wins the Oscar. The usual massive attention to detail by Pixar, especially when it comes to set decoration and animated places and locations, is truly impressive. The twist about who his real relative is was witty and made me more curious about what would happen next. It is very difficult to say anything too negative about this one, but yeah maybe the early parts were not on par with what followed later and as a consequence I think it is not as good as Inside Out, but it's still very good nonetheless. One of the finest animated films from the 2010s. You really wanna see it no matter what age you are. Highly recommended.", "This Movie wasn't even on my radar. I had dismissed it as a book of life copycat.Well it does deal with Dios dela muertos however the story, tone and visuals are completely different.Miguel (voiced by the lively Anthony Gonzalez) dreams of becoming a musician like his ideal. His family however disapproves... strongly disapproves and wants him to follow in the family business of shoe making.In an act of rebellion he finds himself in the land of the dead and needs his family's blessing to get home. Thing is even his dead ancestors disapprove of his dream and want him to give it up.The graphics are stunning and the amount of detail given to everything is staggering, one of the characters. A scruffy skeleton by the name of Hector looked like he had a little scratch on his cheek but later in the movie when the lighting is better and his face is angled just right you notice that no, it's not a scratch. it's part of an interact design similar to the one on sugar skulls. He's just so scruffy that the design is really subtle and only shows when the the light hits him just right.The comedy is cut, the characters heart warming and it has some very down to earth characters (a granny that hits you with her shoe? reminds me of someone I actually know) To top it off all the skeletons and having a kid be in danger, real danger. had the kids in the audience's attention without scaring them. My theater was full of jumpy children but once the movie started not one left his seat or said anything but the occasion \"ohhh..\" \"haha\" while a lot of adults reached for their napkins to hide the tears.A beautiful movie and well worth sitting through the 20 minute frozen merchandise commercial that came before it. (please pick up the new Elsa dress for your five year old once you leave the theater!)", "Pixar has traveled through murky quality waters since arguably the greatest quality run in the history of filmmaking (2007-2010, research it), with Cars 3 sputtering earlier this summer. And with Lasseter shenanigans, lay offs, secret struggles with several projects, the once-invincible animation studio is beginning to show its wear and tear. Coco successfully rights the ship by offering a very engaging storyline that hits every emotion you can possibly fathom and even though its subject matter might scar and emotionally deteriorate some of the youngsters, the film overall is a superb work of detail, love, and a respect for the audience and the culture its representing.The respect towards Mexican culture and folklore is the backbone and most crucial element in the film\u2014messing it up ever so slightly would create all sorts of problems. Luckily despite the recent struggles Pixar remains the best and brightest of the animation studios in terms of sheer detail. From the visible damage on Wall-E to the \"jail tattoos\" on the Toy Story 3 cast, Pixar's history towards meticulous subtle touches keeps them above the competitors at all times. Coco's Mexico (dead and alive) is about as vibrant an atmosphere as you'll ever see in cinema. Animation allows for the scope to be infinitely larger than any live-action sequence, and the animators use every penny of budget and every fiber of talent to deliver two stark yet expansive environments linked together by the Dia De Los Muertos that operates as an extra character in the charming tale of a boy in an anti-musical family trying to follow his dream and become a musician\u2014against the protests and warnings.Whatever this movie lacks in humor (to be honest, it's hard to laugh when the pain is so damn deep) is recovered by the beautiful story and surrounding themes about family, forgiveness, sacrifice, death, and legacy. Being the black sheep of the family and potentially becoming that broken link in the family bond (which is a conflict that is by far stronger in Hispanic culture as compared to most others) is a conflict well-executed by Lee Unkrich and the entire writing team (how Pixar can churn out gems with four writers is a baffling mystery, while working on a script I argue with myself). Managing to find light in the darkness of a film centered around death is a tough task, and it can get quite heavy-handed.The world of the deceased is one that was whimsical, creative, vibrantly colorful, and easily the strongest visual of Coco. I also wish it was explored a little more. At the same time, I would have also loved to see more of Pixar's Mexico, which perfectly nailed the Central American vibe within the opening frames. And at over 100 minutes, it's interesting how the film reveals so much, yet keeps you seeking more, similar to the settings created by Miyazaki. I'm not asking for an arsenal of irritating Frozen-sized featurettes surrounding the world of Coco (I went there, and I don't care), but Mexico and the Land of the Dead deserves some revisiting. The core of the film is the quest of the boy, and no time is wasted sending him on a seemingly impossible task of finding his inspiration to become a musician while running out of life, literally.The secondary characters, the family on both sides of the fence, add a burst of life to an already-vibrant movie. This is supported by strong writing that guarantees no one-dimensional characters, and an excellent ensemble voice cast that deliver flawless performances (special nod to the singers of the spellbinding soundtrack) to help keep the heart of Coco very strong. And in keeping with recent Disney tradition, plot twists and surprising antagonists emerge towards the final act, which ironically gives it a slight twitch of predictability. But as the constant theme in this review, all flaws small and major are forgiven because of the personality and soul of Coco, which will make you smile and simultaneously break you.Mexico was very well-represented to a point that I was secretly irrationally demanding more (the soundtrack should have been sung entirely and only in Spanish for example), but succeeds in not being a movie with Mexicans, but being a pure Mexican flavored film. Coco is one of the best films of the year, the best animated film of 2017 by a long shot, containing one of the best music scores in quite some time, and a delightful 100 minutes that you should spend with family and friends\u2014-so you can all ugly cry together and see who looks the worst.Original Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/", "This pixar film really struck a personal chord with me, Coco has once again solidified pixar as the king of animation and family films. Over the years pixar has given us lots of warm emotional stories but none quite like Coco.Last year's Inside out was certainly great it had its defining moments and it definitely was a very good film, but, Inside out just doesn't have this personal touch that Coco captures perfectly, in fact I think Coco is one of if not the greatest Pixar film. The fact that after this movie I am simply able to forget about the atrociously long Frozen 'short' should go to show just how great it is.While, Coco isn't as innovative storytelling wise and had a rather foreseeable plot twist but. Rather than expanding outwards and reaching new and innovative stories like Inside out Coco does a complete 180 and delves deep into each individual that watches this film. It is such a simple but effective formula that I can't stop praising it, there really isn't anything new to this story yet, there is just something so genuinely warm and relatable in Coco.Coco had one of the most stunning animations, the details put into each character (especially mama coco) was breathtaking, but the use of vibrant colours was an amazing choice. In fact, viewing this movie you would almost forget that the subject matter here is somewhat of a morbid topic, yet similar to the spirit of dias de los muertos Coco captures that vibrant, lively attitude towards death.The soundtrack was also a highlight of Coco in fact, I am listening to Coco's soundtrack as I am writing this, they were not necessarily catchy but as the film as a whole is, genuine and sincere.Coco is about family and the importance of families, but its execution of such a 'cliched' topic is simply mind blowing and as I have said so many times in this review, to sum up this film, it is simply that sense of genuine sincerity that makes this film so real, so warm and so special in Pixar's ever expanding roster of films.", "The movie is OK is pretty colourfull but it lacks on orginality at the end of the plot because they recycled the same plot/scenes from monster inc of zootopia at the end, very disappointing with that They should called pueblito maxico or cempas\u00fachil(the flowers displayed on the film are called), coco is a stupid name, not a common3 out of 23 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This is the kind of movie that only Pixar could make, way above all the 3D talking animals from other brand, up to the level of Inside Out, Up and Wall-E. Spectacularly brilliant. I went to the cinema with my kids, and my 10 year old daughter has been literally kept on edge of her chair when the story reaching its end. However there is one little thing that bothers me, before the feature film, there is a short intro by the filmmakers, they showed a shot of the dead world, and explained that this short has 20 millions light source on 10 millions buildings (or the other way around). I know Pixar/Disney is the vanguard of CG technologies, good for you. But I don't care, that's not what make me drove to the cinema in a snowy night, that's not what kept my kid on the edge of her chair. It's not the 10 million lights shot made Coco great, story and story telling is the unique magic, a great movie is not about the tech or the money, it must also have a soul.2 out of 14 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Late in the newest Pixar/Disney Studios animated feature, \"Coco,\" there is a scene where a father recalls plaintively singing a song, \"Remember Me,\" to his small daughter years before. It's a heart-tugging scene reminiscent of other Pixar movies, \"Up\" and \"Inside Out,\" and it's a genuine lump-in-the-throat moment so prevalent in a picture that combines the widely vibrant colors and images with a thoughtful, adult story and a message of how important family is, no matter how members may fight and disagree with each other.Written by Matthew Aldrich (\"Cleaner\") and neophyte Adrian Molina and lovingly directed by Molina and Lee Unkrick (\"The Good Dinosaur\"), \"Coco,\" named after a senile (or so it would seem) maternal great- grandmother character, is nothing short of a love letter to Mexico, just like \"Moana\" was a positive epistle to the South Pacific islands and \"Brave\" is an affectionate note to Scotland, etc.It's the story of 10-year old Miguel (voice of Anthony Gonazales in his debut), a precocious child who loves music and idolizes his country's greatest singer, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt, \"The Infiltrator, \"Law and Order\" TV series), who was crushed by a falling bell in the 1940s.However, Miguel's family, beginning with his great-great grandmother, hate music because her husband left her and her baby girl (\"Coco\") to pursue stardom many years ago. Trying to persuade his parents to allow him to participate in a talent show and discovering that Ernesto might just be a direct ancestor, he visits the singer's grave and steals his guitar, a magic event that sends him to the land of the dead where skeletal passed-on relatives visit their living offspring each Nov. 1 (the Day of the Dead).It's here that the visuals almost overwhelm one's senses with the amazing multi-colored world of spirits with a dizzying array of marvelous and seamless effects. Pixar has had a very good record in this department, but there were also turkeys in the bunch (notably \"Cars 2,\" \"Brave,\" \"Big Hero Six\"), but this one brings the studio to its apex once again ...The one thing that has made Pixar Studios so successful in making high quality CGI films is not just the brilliant animation and the love and craftsmanship that go into each effort, it's those wonderful stories. While the kiddies can wallow in the vivid visual spectrum, high energy action and such lovable and classic characters as Sully, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Nemo, Lightning McQueen Wall-e and Bing-Bong, among others, their parents can relish the thoughtful and interesting plot lines.Here, for a such a simple premise, the tale is extremely layered and nuanced. Miguel, like the female character in \"Inside Out,\" is not a clich\u00e9 kid, but a real human being with all the feelings, pain, angst and emotion as our real children. When he breaks into tears after his grandmother smashes his guitar, we actually FEEL his remorse.The scenes beyond the realm of the living are vivid, amazingly artistic and wondrous, while the emotions run from frivolity to fright to sadness and back again. It is truly a roller coaster ride of emotion that leaves you tearful one moment and exultant the next. In this wacky world where the dearly-departed exist only because the quick remember them, Miguel finds himself a fugitive because he, well, he just ISN'T dead \u2014 yet. He is offered to be sent back home by his great-great grandmother (Alanna Ubach, \"To the Bone,\" \"Rango\"), but she insists that he give up his affection for music \u2014 forever.He refuses, of course, even though he may have to stay there forever, and soon goes searching for Ernesto, but finds Hector (voice of Gael Garcia Bernal, \"Salt and Fire\"), instead, a down and out corpse who cannot even visit earth because no one recalls him or has ever put his picture on the mantel of remembrance. The two travel together through this crazy universe \u2014 along with Miguel's pet mongrel, Dante \u2014 and discover all is not as it seems, however.All the while, recognizable Mexican words, phrases and icons such as El Santo (the lucha wrestler), comedian Cantinflas, artist Frida Kahlo and others are among the spectors who seek to keep their memories alive \u2014 within BOTH worlds.The resolution is as powerful and affecting as any Pixar project has been and we are left with a wet handkerchief, but a happy heart, as well. Grade: B+", "I initially planned to view this movie on Saturday, though neither dates seemed suitable for a movie centered around D\u00eda de Muertos (Pixar should have released this movie around October 22, as that would make more sense). Luckily, plans involving my brother's friends worked out later, and so he was able to view this movie tonight with me and my parents. So, what have I to say about this movie?To be honest, the story, while strong by animation movie standards, is just barely outside the standards Pixar movies set over a decade ago (with Cars being an exception). It features fantastic messages about family coming before everything else, which I personally can relate to since my family is my main concurrent attachment. It is paced superbly and does share believable enough ideas to be easily conveyed in an imaginative family story. Probably the biggest, but certainly not fatal flaw, lies in its twists. Given how I thought Ernesto was a rather shady person from the start, I predicted some of his actions towards Miguel. Granted, they were executed with grace despite their predictability, which is why I took only a small bit from that. Otherwise, it has plenty of touching moments and fantastic chuckles interspersed throughout, even unintentionally. The characters are very well written and can provide for many reminders on why family is indeed important, no matter how enormous and bold our ambitions for fame may be. They can give us emotion we can't feel from simple friend relationships, and give us memories that, once they come back to us, cannot be lost for the remainder of our time on Earth. Depicting all this is Pixar's undeniably best animation yet, with fantastic attention to detail and especially inside the Land of the Dead, which has more colors than Trolls and the Finding Nemo series combined. However, it still has all the believability in both the Alive and Dead worlds that remind us why Pixar was once (and maybe still might be) one of the studios that defined animation as we know it. Mere language cannot describe the glory that the animation exudes like its catchy and even somewhat memorable music. That, in fact, is all I have to say about the latter.If you observe D\u00eda de Muertos, know someone who does, or enjoy Disney and/or Pixar movies, I cannot guarantee you won't enjoy this movie. In fact, I'd say that this is up there with The LEGO Batman Movie as one of 2017's best family movies. As stumbling as Cars 3 was for Pixar, they have shown that with one film that didn't work (like Cars), their next attempt produces another masterpiece (like Ratatouille). Put simply, go see it.", "Please be warned my review must contain a major spoiler, as the main reason I was so saddened by \"Coco,\" when I went to the theater hoping for joyous laughs and a truly touching (and musical) celebration of D\u00eda de los Muertos (the impression I got from trailers, clips, and reviews I'd read prior to my seeing the film) is a critical plot point. Instead of joy, laughter, and earned tears I felt the filmmakers were far too calculated in their usage of an elderly woman's dementia and her slow decline toward death, so the supposedly \"uplifting\" ending instead came off as cruel and even heartless in manipulating the audience to tears (and likely tapping into very sad memories of relatives and friends who have passed from dementia and Alzheimer's). I also found the first third of the film almost completely unengaging, which truly surprised me, as Pixar is usually so careful with story and characters. This felt like a film that was coldly calculated to drain tear ducts rather than earning those tears from joyous creation and real caring for the characters onscreen. I hope I'm wrong about the filmmakers' intentions, but I came out of the theater thoroughly depressed and feeling, well, horribly manipulated. Dementia and Alzheimer's are incredibly cruel diseases, and their reality is very different than how it is portrayed at the end of \"Coco.\" Either the filmmakers and scriptwriters have never actually closely experienced someone they loved being taken by these diseases or they are as heartless as it comes in using the gravity of these diseases as an easy way to make audiences cry. To those who loved the film and felt it earned its emotion: Of course I hope we will see our relatives and friends who have been diminished by memory diseases fully restored in the afterlife, but here it struck me as a cheap, quick, and easy shortcut trick of manipulation: The \"triumph\" of the final afterlife scene was either unintentionally cruel or coldly cruel, depending on the filmmakers' personal reasons for including same in the film. Be warned that if you have closely watched a loved one deteriorate and struggle with the fear and horror of losing their memory and faculties you, too, may find yourself angry at film's end, instead of joyous and uplifted. The only reason I gave this film two stars is that the animation is undeniably beautiful, and some of the songs tuneful and engaging--but that was it for me for any bit of enjoyment of the film.", "Coco is the project in which Pixar has worked, a film that addresses one of the most important Mexican traditions: the Day of the Dead.Tells the story of a 12-year-old teenager, Miguel, who has the dream of becoming a successful musician, even though his family does not agree with it, since they believe that they have been cursed by music, as the great-great-grandfather his family to pursue his dreams as a singer. Miguel's desire arises from his admiration for the deceased singer Ernesto De La Cruz, so Miguel decides to go to his grave to borrow his guitar and participate in a contest, where he will demonstrate and seek to convince his family about his passion for the music, but in that course things get complicated and Miguel enters the Kingdom of the Dead. the music, but in that course things get complicated and Miguel enters the Kingdom of the Dead.

The movie's storyline was quite boring. It's about a boy named Coco who loves to play his guitar. He has a grandfather who was famous for his songs, who was later killed by a bell in 1942. A problem is that Coco's family doesn't like music. So Coco's grandmaother destroys his guitar. Coco later goes to his grandfathers grave and takes his grandfather's guitar. Next thing you know, he gets trapped in a different dimension (Idk what it's called, but it's where all the dead people's souls go to).The good is the animation.

Despite my two-decades long worshipping at the animated alter of Pixar, the trailer for this one just never struck a chord with me. Thank goodness there was a late night showing aboard my recent Disney cruise, or I might still not have caught this gem that ranks among Pixar's best ... and this is the studio that has gifted us the TOY STORY franchise, THE INCREDIBLES, UP, and INSIDE OUT - instant classics, each and every one.Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina team up as co-writers and co-directors for the 19th feature film from Pixar Studios. It's the second Pixar film this year (CARS 3), but the first original (non-sequel) since 2015 (THE GOOD DINOSAUR, INSIDE OUT). This latest not only offers the most advanced visuals to date, it also features a complex story that touches on numerous topics: Mexican culture, family legacy, religious traditions, loyalty, following one's own path, respect for the elderly, and remembrance of those deceased. If all of that sounds a bit too heavy-handed and deep for kids, keep in mind that Pixar charmed us with UP, the story of a man whose wife dies - yet, they kept us laughing with one word ...\"squirrel!\"The story focuses on young Miguel and his desire to sing and play guitar despite his long-standing family ban on music. Miguel is convinced he is related to the most famous Mexican performer in history, Ernesto de la Cruz, and he concocts a plan that corresponds to Dia de Muertos to convince his family that he must be allowed to play music. The film is respectful to this tradition as the living pay tribute to those who have passed. The deceased are invited back for this one night with beautiful flowers guiding them from the Land of the Dead to that of the living.Miguel's adventure is quite a wild ride as he navigates the path between the living and the dead. Somehow the film is even a visual step up from the colorful beauty of UP and INSIDE OUT, with the city and the unique flying creature being exceptionally stunning. The Pixar charm and personality are evident throughout - even in Dante, the ever-present dog. Many Mexican celebrities and historical figures (including Frida Kahlo) are noted, but at its core, this is the story of a boy pursuing his dream, no matter the obstacles.Pixar fans will be relieved to know that the Pizza Planet truck makes an appearance, as does A113, and numerous other Easter eggs. John Ratzenberger keeps his Pixar streak alive, and though Anthony Gonzalez (Miguel), Gael Garcia Bernal (Hector) and Benjamin Bratt (Ernesto de la Cruz) all do fine work, this one is not so much about the voice acting as it is about the tremendous story and art work. Remarkably, Pixar has done it again ... an animated masterpiece that is among its finest yet. Parents should note that the film is rated PG, rather than G.

Characters morph into skeletal figures. Life becomes a struggle with Death. These very macabre settings celebrate the Day of the Dead in this off- kilter animated children's film that is big on visual splash but a tad weak in storytelling and charm. Welcome to the world of Coco.\ufffcAs with most animated films these days, the story rarely matches the visual flair. And, in this case, the story and plot never quite makes logical sense: Miguel, the young hero in the story, wants to be a musician but is not allowed to utter a single note due to a family tradition of banning music from their household. It seems that his great great grandmother, the title character named Coco, had a mother who was deserted by her musician father who put fame and fortune ahead of family. Yet Miguel has the need to sing out, inspired by his late great idol, Ernesto de la Cruz. This leads him unexpectedly to visit the Land of the Dead. Convoluted? Wait...and he must get back to the Land of the Living by sunrise if he wants to return to his family ever again. Huh? Like I said, if I have problems following the story, younger children will be lost as well.\ufffcThere is also so much exposition in this film, too much in fact, in order to set-up the complicated plot structure. Some rewrites by the director Adrian Molina and Matthew Aldrich would have certainly helped to define the characters and their actions. Our small hero, Miguel, is cute and endearing, but not very appealing with his big doe eyes and Pillsbury dough boy generic face. He resembles a good-looking Cabbage Patch kid. Coco is essentially a minor major character, with about as much screen-time as Dame Judi Dench in Shakespeare in Love, but she makes a lasting impression in a touching closing scene which is Pixar's forte. Actually Hector, Miguel's sidekick in this Dead Man's Land, provides more interesting and the animators have some fun delivering some needed humor with his movable skeletal parts. Voice-over work is fine with Anthony Gonzalez, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Benjamin Bratt as standouts.\ufffcMr. Molina and Lee Unkrich co-directed this movie and they keep the action moving along at a nice pace while sacrificing character development for action. The songs aren't very memorable either, although the main ditty, Remember Me, is at least hummable. So what makes the film worth your time and money? It's purely the spectacle of state-of-the-art animation that is a remarkable step forward in animation.\ufffcYes, it is the visual artistry on display which elevates this tale. Colors shimmer unlike most animated films. A note-worthy phosphorous glow throughout the film's many sequences gives the film its distinctive visual quality. The intensity of light adds a unique richness to the backgrounds which upstages most of the underwritten characters and unfocused plot. There are also lovely textures with the wooden carved faces of the skeleton figures, detailed animal spirits that glisten, and a transfixing luminescent ethereal world that adds to the mystique of the overall production.\ufffcThe color palette is stunning state-o-the-art animation. Vivid in its saturation point and rendered in amazing exactness. Coco is unadulterated eye candy. Oranges contrast against azure backgrounds...deep purples blend into shades of crimson. It's a glorious mix of hues that would beguile any moviegoer.\ufffcBut originality and imagination come to an abrupt stop with the film's dull screenplay. This is conventional storytelling, not worthy the artistry that surrounds it. (2014's The Book of Life followed a similar subject, with weaker results, and although the images in Coco are truly remarkable, the plot is not.) There is a nifty twist midway that almost explains some of the illogical loose strands of the plot, but it comes a bit late.\ufffcThe doltish script never reaches the same level of excellence as the masterful images on screen. And let's face it, the subject of death is a real downer, especially in a children's film that has very few comedic moments to lighten its heavy subject. However, kudos to the film's multicultural message, its all-inclusive Latin American actors doing voice-over work, and to Pixar Studios for tackling such an adult theme while staying true to the story's Mexican heritage.\ufffcCoco is a solid achievement, a good film that is dressed to the tens. But all of the visual trickery can't hide its empty-headed plot.", "I went into the theater thinking it'd be like The Book of Life 2, but no... It was far more than that. The plot doesn't revolve around love like most Disney cartoons, it is about bond between family. This was pretty deep despite it being a children's movie. I enjoyed it as a 15 year old and learned from it. I cried near the end of the movie, it was really touching overall. Way beyond my expectations. One thing though, there's this annoying, 30 minute Frozen short film played before the actual movie which annoys me.1 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Coco is a very, very good movie that earns its heart about two-thirds of the way in - a little later than one may be used to given this is the director of Up - and has imagination pouring in every little mark of animation and detail. It's also the rare movie by this studio to be an animated musical, of a sort, and it is ingrained in the DNA of the thing- I thought it would be about something as simple (and still important) as music. That would have been enough. I got more than that, chiefly an inquiry through drama about what memory means in existential terms. Yeah, I didn't expect that quite either, but then again it IS the land of the dead we're dealing with here.It is one thing to think deeply about what a life means and the death that everyone faces. The real terror is not having anything beyond this plane of existence; this world of the undead skeletons snd spirit animals is comforting ultimately since, naturally, there is a place after we die that we can reunite with others and be merry and so on. But what if you are gone and... That is it? Mexican culture (and this goes for other cultures too) has another idea about the afterlife, hence the Day of the Dead (Dios lis muertos), than we typically think of. But functionally it is this version of heaven that is a bit, uh, funkier, cooler, more colorful, less uh... White.The main conflict is deceptive here. I think what keeps it from full greatness for me is that Miguel is a bit too typical of one of these animated characters, or just in any of these \"I wanna do this with my life\" \"No you can't! Family!\" \"Bah! No!\" Etc stories. Just this past summer the underrated Patti Cakes had that basic premise in gritty rap. This also has to include, as these stories do, the old \"dont meet your heroes\" maxim, in this case with Ernesto De La Cruz, the Mexican equivalent of an Elvis. So while one might think this is where the movie will be going, what throws the plot an excellent monkey wrench is Hector, a gangly undead guy who comes on like he'll be another in a long line of helpful but, again, conventional comedic side kicks (this world's Genie).The power of Coco, past its inspired look and immersive world and its solid aims at humor (ie the wonderful surrealistic scene where the female assistant to De La Cruz makes her Dali-style sets), is that Hector, not Miguel, is the heart of the movie. It should be too jammed full of revelations by the end of the second act (and like other Pixae, this *is* very 3-act structure, and thats fine, they know how to do it well), maybe taking its cues slightly from Telenovelas for dramatic emphasis. But without revealing too much, as you should go in knowing little story reveal wise as pissible, Hector emphasizes the main song of the movie, \"Remember Me,\" and it makes a profound point. Memory is for the living after all - why have a cemetery at all or a memorial like done every Day of the Dead otherwise - and it's another one of those times like Inside Out where a characters existence carries total, paramount importance.Oh, and if you don't cry (as my wife did), you'll smile, genuinely, from the commitment to its emotional outreach. Coco isn't in my top grouping of Pixar films but it's only due to a minor feeling of familiarity. Its strengths are no less though than classic Pixar: amazing and deeply- drawn characters, unforgettable designs, and that is about something at a time when a lot of animation storytellers think having characters dance and tart is enough. This wants you to laugh and cry and sometimes be genuinely surprised, and if you buy the soundtrack that's icing on the cake.", "A film coming from the studio of Disney and Pixar, once again hitting the ground for not only for kids but for everyone.

This could have easily looked like a puddle of unicorn vomit. In Pixar's hands it instead created breath taking visuals.The animation was also second to none. Pixar managed to take something as nondescript as a skeleton and give it culture and personality. Not just by giving them a voice with a Spanish accent, but by giving them very subtle yet nuanced mannerisms that are instantly recognizable to anyone who grew up in or around the Mexican culture.Even though this isn't really a spoiler I'm going to give a SPOILER ALERT anyway.With the jaded cynicism of us all in today's modern audience, what can be bigger praise of a movie than saying that it triggered real emotions in me.

In the movie, the child is passionate to become a musician, and he happens to discover the truth of his great-grandparents' love story during his mysterious journey.For me, this story is also another version of love story. It is about the relation in lovers, how it can mislead the other party, but it is always important to remember the goodness. Fame, wealth and money are no more important than real love. The bad guy is the one who wants the world to adore him that he can kill his friend for being famous.

With all of the music that was produced in coco, and the instruments they used were used in the movie, and just the overall sound and dancing that was portrayed was exactly how modern day latino music is performed and portrayed as in today's world. Although the singing isn't as perfect as it is portrayed in Coco but it really hit the spot with how Miguel would scream or yell before he sang. In modern latino music doing that is quite an impressive characteristic that someone can perform cause not everybody can do it at that high of a pitch for as long as they do it is really something special. Overall Coco was an amazing film and I think since it was animated it really was created to teach more of the younger population about the mexican holiday \"el dia de los muertos\", yes they could have made it with actual people but then the younger kids wouldn't have been able to learn and experience the holiday and learn overall about the mexican culture. These days in mexico when people or a band sing, since dancing is a big part of their culture they tend to draw fairly large crowds \"Brazilian Melissa Carvalho of the Capoeira Academy of Gainesville said the mix of martial arts, acrobatics and dance has helped draw people to the culture of Brazil.\"(Cindy Swirko, September 27, 2014). Since people tend to enjoy the music and love dancing to the live performances and during parties, in the film \"Coco\", \"Music style includes genres such as Salsa, Bachata, Latin Pop and Regional Mexican music\"( Neil Vogel,2016). Overall the movie \"Coco\" very well portrays exactly how the latino culture is today with all of the music that is played throughout the movie and all of the dancing that is performed in the movie and it especially a great movie because it targets the younger population so they can learn about other cultures as well.", "In-depth story should not compromise humor.

It's a stunningly beautiful and sweet celebration that could easily fit into most any cultural tradition, so why isn't it more widely recognized? Well, Pixar is doing their part with Coco. A studio that's never afraid to explore sadness and death with levity and heart, they've given us (in essentially their first musical) a film as vibrantly colorful and moving as the holiday it's informed by. Coco's story is pretty basic: kid rebels from hard-nosed family, makes friends with other outcasts, discovers his true calling, gets into some trouble, and tries to reconcile his tradition with his desire. Think Ratatouille, with music instead of food, and people instead of rats. It falls into some unnecessary story clich\u00e9s and questionable character decisions, but it's never overwhelming. The brightness in the smaller things is incredible. The preciseness of the music, the connection to characters' plights, the energetic scenes and scenery, the jaw-dropping and unique animation; it's all festively enveloping. And beneath the juxtaposition of the unremarkable story and near-perfect details is Pixar's virtually unblemished record of deep emotions. The colors of Coco's world may draw in our sight; however, its characters' arcs, its thoughts on the importance of extended families, and its unapologetic desire to explore the inevitable and inherent sadness of aging and death, with plenty of entertainment along the way, make it another Pixar movie families should be celebrating.", "I was afraid that Pixar lost it!

Instead,the film shows us something deeper and more meaningful.The film wants to convey the idea that many tough choices exist in our life. Fame or Conscience? Dream or family? These are all the crucial questions worth thinking for everyone of us. Cartoon films always finish with a happy ending, which is not the case in the real life. In this sense, the film really provokes our deep reflections on life. P.S. Just as I'm writing this review,I hear someone singing the theme song \"Remember Me\"of this film in my dorm building.

It's not that the trailer was misleading or too vague in regard to the plot, but I wasn't certain as to the tone. There was a lot of chase scenes and slapstick humor sprinkled around some plot points, I was worried that they were going to treat a pretty deep subject matter with too little gravity. Thankfully my fears were unfounded. Everything about this movie was approached with respect and it presents itself as a labor of love. There is plenty of action to move the plot along, and to be honest, there is more than enough physical humor predicated upon skeletons not being the most stable objects in the world when they're unencumbered by muscles and sinew, but the movie has real heart and it deals with real themes honestly and gently at the same time. All of this wrapped up in a vibrant and deep world that immerses you in Mexican culture with an enchanting and romantic score to guide you through this visual paradise. It's not a perfect film, but there's nothing you can point to as a flaw really worth fleshing out and analyzing. Everything that is not perfect about this movie is easily forgivable and forgettable, because it is honest and earnest, visually striking and emotionally rich. This is definitely a film that I'll watch again, and I'm sure with how deep this movie was that there will be even more things to pick up on the second and third time through. I can't wait.", "Some feel that COCO honors pagan holdovers. The \"genius\" of Christianity of the Roman Catholic sort was to adapt what people had to teach a lesson. Look at the Chinese. Missionaries, Catholic and Protestant, saw ancestor worship as idolatry. Now they say it is merely remembering the past, learning the good from it and letting go of the failures. Christmas came from the Saturnalia. During that time, Romans were ordered to be cheerful and generous. On one of the days, servants and masters reversed roles, getting back to the golden age when men were one and in community. Besides who lets anyone freze or starve during the deadliest, darkest time of year. All Saints Day took over Samhain, the Druidic first day of winter when the boundaries between the worlds went down. Saints have always been those who are \"with God\", doing good, being human beings, mensches. Some are declared to be with God and \"worthy of imitation\". The idea of the soul is a pagan construct. The Hebrews believed that you did not worship God from the grave. But God is abstract, no dimension or measurement, Being itself, not a being among other beings. God is present where there is Truth, Justice, Charity. And the dead are still \"with God\" if they were with God in life. They are with God in memory. As the elder Muslim said in a Town Called Alice, \"Who cares for women and children has God not far from him,\" when asked to help wandering mothers and their children in Japanese-occupied Malayia in 1942. All Saint and All Souls teach that: remember the good that your family did and follow it. They loved you. Love others. It is an ordinary concept for ordinary people. It is not some ritual performed at a High Mass in the Cathedral for the rich hacienda owners or the capitalist elite. It is Francis of Assisi, pedestrian, barefoot, not a priest, not in the hierarchy, looking for the man or woman who needs help or a helping hand, who works alongside the men and women in the fields or the factories, who dresses in overalls. So there. COCO has that kind of heart.", "I must say that I went to the cinema expecting a good Pixar movie (of which I like most of them). But I'm happy to say Coco is a movie that changes the way you think even more than Inside Out. I must confess that I had feelings of joy and sadness during the movie and tears are the profound effect of the mix of images, music (the most beautiful short song ever created, \"Remember me\") and the story. Pixar creators are blessed people that bring the magic to life and creates new worlds for us to discover and enjoy.

Dozens of films in, and they are beginning to expand their geographical reach with storytelling. That's a long time sure, but it's most certainly better late than never. Luckily, Coco isn't just an exploration into a new territory for Pixar, it's also a brilliantly charming and original film that delves into deep themes without forgetting what makes kids films entertaining and special in their own right.It's not that Pixar or Disney Animation hasn't given us several movies that encourage children to reach for their goals (but to also remember family), but I love the way Coco uses the power of music into those genre clich\u00e9s. One of my favorite films of all time is Almost Famous, and that's also a film that nails the power of music in an endearing way. Coco does this while also telling a beautiful story of family (a big one that is) in a visually stunning way. Just as Moana, Inside Out, and Finding Dory did for Disney Animation and Pixar in the last few years, Coco once again progresses the world of animation to an entirely new level. There's one particular shot in Coco, as Miguel first enters and gazes upon the world of the dead, that is among the most impresses shots visually that I have seen in quite some time.Of course, Coco isn't just a technical darling, it's also a heartfelt story of a family with tradition, and sometimes there's nothing more likable than that. It isn't easy to truly care about a group of dead family members to the lead character, Miguel, but somehow this film manages to do just that. Probably due to the charisma of young Miguel, the witty dialogue, and poignant direction from Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina.With a few twists and turns, well-developed characters, dazzling visuals, and one epic journey, Coco is yet another solid entry into Disney/Pixar's long list of animated adventures.

The movie began with something that always bothered me, why unnecessary 3D nowadays and it from the start itself made the statement it is a 3D movie. We get to see the story of a boy who loves music, but their family doesn't, which is totally preposterous and downright impossible to believe, but believe me, there's fun around these situations\u0085 And movie does a good job in putting the Mexican tradition and customs out there subtly, but not letting what the movie wants to speak get in its way. That was a job well done. Then we get to the Land of Dead (because if you steal from the dead, you get transported there, which seems like most people must have gone there, but let's move on..) and oh my that scene where the shot spanned from the bridge to the place was beautiful! You might be wondering if all dead people live here how do they cramp in together, well they have built houses upwards and downwards and people who r not remembered die? from that place and it seems like a place for only Mexicans? No racism intended. But they let things that matter explain the mechanisms of the Land of Dead than just show how things work. Job well done there too!

Rebellious, passionate, and determined Miguel is ready to take on the world and his strict grandmother for his dream only to find himself dealing with ghosts from the past\u0085quite literally. A journey to the land of the dead opens his eyes and heart to family and forgiveness. It's a deeply touching tale that surprises you at every turn. What's meant to be a children's movie turns out to be a tearjerker and spirit- lifter for anyone with a soul (the puns are unintended but so fitting). If you've ever felt loss in your life this film will welcome you with open arms.Perhaps I shouldn't call them children's movies because Pixar has produced stories recently (Inside Out and Zootopia come to mind) that a child might not fully comprehend but a knowing adult would be greatly affected by. Coco follows a similar journey of complexity and emotion. The graphics and art are spellbinding and wonderfully mounted. It's hard to look away from everything going on. It's a towering achievement in animation, no doubt. While the look is refined the heart is where the the movie really scores because believe me, you won't leave the theatre with dry eyes.Anthony Gonzalez, the young actor behind the voice of Miguel, delivers a genuinely heartfelt performance as do the older actors who enact their parts with aplomb. Directors Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina have shown Mexico with extreme care. It's an ode to a glorious and rich culture. Everything from the dialogues to the set pieces and characters feel real and close to life. Art isn't bound by one race or location and this movie is a shining example of that.Well made movies will speak to you no matter what language they're made in or what genre they fit it. The story deals with death but it's uplifting in its approach. Watch it. You'll be delighted, thrilled, moved, and ready to embrace your loved ones. That's what this movie felt like- a warm hug from your grandmother. The tears will come and so will the smiles. It's a winner all the way.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com/", "I saw \"Coco\" starring the voices of Anthony Gonzalez-Criminal Minds:Beyond Borders_tv, The Bridge_tv; Gael Garcia Bernal-Mozart in the Jungle_tv, Desierto; Benjamin Bratt-Doctor Strange_2016, 24:Live Another Day_tv and Edward James Olmos-The Blade Runner movies, The Green Hornet_2011. This is an animated Pixar/Disney movie about the Mexican Day of the Dead, aka:Dia de los Muertos. They even use Mexican mariachi style music in the credits-beginning & end-when they show the Disney logo with the fireworks going off. The theater I was at was also showing it in both English & Spanish versions. Anyway, Anthony plays a little 10- 12 year old boy that loves music, both playing guitar and singing, just like his idol, Benjamin. But his whole family does not allow music in the house-because of a great great grandfather that was a traveling musician and left his family to pursue his career-and forbids Anthony to participate in any form. FYI: The title character of Coco, is the daughter of the a fore mentioned traveling musician, who is now Anthony's great grandmother. Anthony decides to borrow the guitar of Benjamin from his tomb-who died in an accident while he was on stage-but stealing from the dead sends Anthony to the land of the dead, where he meets Gael, an old friend of Benjamin, who promises to help Anthony find Benjamin in the afterlife. Edward is a character called Chicharron. The animation is really amazing, especially when they show the culture and traditions of the holiday. Some, I knew about-like the photos and mementos of the departed being displayed in little shrines-but others, I was unfamiliar with-like the animal spirit guides in the afterlife. There is a 21 minute short film called 'Olaf's Frozen Adventure' that is shown before the movie-I'm sure that it is just an early promotion for the next Frozen movie, but it was enjoyable-there are a couple of new songs in it. It's rated \"PG\" for thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. Although it is definitely aimed at a Hispanic audience, you don't have to be Hispanic to enjoy it-I did. I would buy it on Blu-ray.", "Soulless cash grab, tremendous waste of resources that could've contributed to something useful and better.

And the opening, with the storytelling on the flags, is almost magical! I do give the movie an eight, taking away one for the much-too-scary spirit guide and one for the super lull in the story about midway. But I'd give this movie no stars based on the fact that is seems so much like Book of Life! The similarities between the two films are too many to list! I hope Pixar/Disney gives those filmmakers half of their gross! Gee whiz! p.s. - The Frozen short before this movie was not very good. It was interesting too that the short was so \"white\" compared to the film, which felt so diverse.

Characters are fully developed. If there was a temptation to stereotype, it never creeps into the characters or interactions. The skin, features, expressions, movements: With the animation, you forget the characters aren't \"real\" - they seem real all the time, when they ask a question, respond, react. Marvelous. The story line is complex with plenty of complications and cross overs. Had to keep listening, keep watching to pick up the facts and bring them into alignment with the story as it developed and as it surprised. The music .... \"Remember Me\", \"It's All Relative\", \"Adios Chicharron\", \"The World Es Mi Familia\", \"Skeleton Key Escape\".... I liked them all and there are many many more.

It looked like a new and unique concept coming from one of the best animation studios, Pixar. But could the film as a whole live up to the expectations it set for me through the trailer? I went to see the film to find out for myself, and left the film with a feeling of satisfaction. Despite a few minor flaws with the film's plot, the overall experience is one of full investment in world that is so lively and vibrant.The film follows the story of a young boy, named Miguel, who wants to become a musician, despite his family's history of hatred for music. Through a series of events in an attempt to follow his passion and resist his family, Miguel accidentally ends up in the Land of the Dead. The rest of the film follow's Miguel's journey to retain his mortality without losing that which he holds most dear to himself.In essence, the plot is fairly standard for Disney/Pixar family films. When you dissect the film, and strictly look at the plot, it's nothing that we haven't seen before. This is where most of the problems I have with the film come into play. Recurring tropes that we've seen before in other family films make their recurrence in Coco. The use of these recurring plot tropes does not compromise the overall experience. However, it does prevent more abstract and complex ideas to be explored and utilized in the film, which I find to be much more effect, especially in children and family films. The use of more complex and abstract ideas in a children films helps young viewers to gain a new and unique perspective of the world, which can be vital at such a young age of development. They won't gain this perspective if they are subjected to the same over- utilized tropes we've seen in a multitude of films.What the film might lack in it's plot and story, it compensates for in it's aesthetic and unique visual style. The thing that sticks out in my mind when thinking back on the film is the overall visual aesthetic. More specifically, the use of environmental coloring. All of the objects in this film are so vibrant and stand out in my mind. It all pops right off of the screen and is very pleasant to look at. The film could have been nothing but establishing shots of the Land of the Dead, and I still could have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it. Every character has such a unique style of movement in their animations, which helps them stand out through a visual means. The film takes full advantage of it's visual medium to, not only portray the story and characters, but to pull the audience into it's environment and immerse them in the world of the movie.In addition to a visual appealing environment, the characters of the film are also warm and welcoming, making it easier to get drawn into the world of the film, and become invested in the conflict and struggles of our main characters. Miguel is a very warm and friendly child, who has a central conflict which many audience members can relate to, allowing them to easily attach themselves to his situation. Even if you don't relate to his struggle, he is likable enough that you find yourself rooting for him throughout the film. The supporting cast of characters, including a group of Miguel's skeletal ancestors from the Land of the Dead, are all intriguing and enjoyable characters, who you quickly become attached to. They all have fun dialogue, as well as unique faults and flaws, allowing them to become more dynamic characters. With the exception of a few, who fall into the similar plot tropes which we've seen reoccur in recent Disney and Pixar films, the characters all feel very warm and dynamic, and you enjoy watching their journey throughout the film's arc.In conclusion, Coco is a fun and enjoyable film that will be good for the whole family. Adults will get as much enjoyment out of it as kids. Despite some annoying recurring plot tropes that we've seen in other children movies, the visual style of the film keeps you drawn in and invested the whole way through. The positives of this film are far greater than the negatives. Though it doesn't quite reach the same level of intellectual depth that children's films like Inside Out have reached, it still is a visual marvel with warm and welcoming characters that you root for. The enjoyable and fun atmosphere of the film carries throughout, and sticks with you after you walk out of the theater. The lighthearted and fun moments keep you engaged, and the film is not afraid to back down from some more sad and touching moments. I actually found myself tearing up, on occasion, in the last 20 minutes of the film, which does not happen very often for me as a film viewer. If you ever get the chance to see 2017's Coco, I would definitely recommend it. Watch it and see for yourself.", "This will sure to be a classic. I enjoyed this as much as Wall-E and Up! Brilliant themes throughout around family relationships and death all to a stunning visuals. The only thing would have been for Pixar to have cut out the \"highly lacking\" Frozen mini-movie prior the main show. . . or at least paired it with a movie which wasn't as brilliant as Coco (which didn't help the image of the Frozen franchise at all. . .even my daughter was asking when the main move would start and she loves Frozen).

Their last few films such as \"Brave,\" \"The Good Dinosaur\" \"Finding Dory\", and \"Cars 3\" were all mediocre, or at least below the bar of what I've come to expect from Pixar. This gets back to what put Pixar on the map in the first place: Amazing stories with a heartfelt message. The visuals in this movie are amazing! They pop off the screen! I'm amazed how Pixar manages to outdo themselves with the animation every year. They really put a lot of time, care, and effort into making this film the best it could be. The story is fantastic, has some good twists and a bit of dark humor (which is surprising from Pixar), and an important, heartfelt message that will make you emotional. The songs in this movie were fun and catchy (although it is not a musical). This is one of the few times where I agree that Pixar should win all the Oscars, as opposed to more recent years where I said that they had monopolized and stolen the awards from films I thought were superior. As hard as I tried, I couldn't find anything to nitpick. Nothing that would dock this film from being a perfect score. It's not that I didn't want to like the film, but part of being a film critic is being critical. I tried to find something, anything, that could improve this film, but as hard as I tried, I just couldn't. It's a perfect film! This will definitely win the Oscar for Best Animated Film, and this time I agree that it deserves to instead of \"It's Pixar. It wins by default.\"\nGrade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars", "1.

What makes up for these problems are: the jaw-dropping animation, the vast and vibrant world that you can't help roaming over it in your mind, and the flawlessly-executed heartbreaking final act.

Not to mention the main song of the movie 'Remember Me' ( as it happened, completely unmemorable) a song Hector would sing to his daughter, but, Ernesto' greatest hit which he claims to have written. Well, to get around that they have the grandmother's psychotic hatred of music and the banning of it in the home (Footloose?) But, it would be impossible to avoid it if Ernesto de la Cruz was such a huge star in his home town which is Miguel's home town. Silly, lazy plotting.\nSuch a shame as the idea for the story could have been really good if they had sat down and thought out the plot a wee bit more.", "My toddler means I don't watch a lot of films, but when I do then I tend to watch it over and over and over again. Over time I have tried to bump her to different things, even if only to get more diversity in the mix. Coco was one such film snuck into normal habits, and it was done because I'd not seen it myself. The film follows a young boy who is banned from playing music due to an ancestor who was a musician but left the family, and when he tries to steal a guitar to enter a Day of the Dead contest, he finds himself transported to the other side and needing the help of his family in getting him home.As is often the case with Pixar films, Coco deals with some difficult issues in a way that is accessible and not too challenging. In this case it is death and loss, and the film deserves credit for the way it gives messages of acceptance, of grief, and of memory. Coco is also notable for the cultural setting, which is unusual in such a mainstream film. The pressure of both of these things can be felt though, and while the film is pretty light and well balanced, it does feel a bit restrained by the pressure of being respectful and serious on its setting and themes. Perhaps related to this, the film is not as sharp in the narrative as Pixar at their best - it doesn't totally have the heart, laughs, or intelligence that an Up or Wall-E or Toy Story would bring to the table. For sure it is still a very good film, and is solid across the board, but it rarely rises above this - which is more than fine were it not for the film's own ancestors standing above it.", "Beautiful story and visually stunning.

But something told me: this was going somewhere I didn't predict and I was gonna love it. That spirit animal that led me was right.It's hard to describe all of Coco without spoilers or things best left explored by new viewers. But, suffice to say, it's about a musical soul who is held back by family and must reveal the truth, come hell or living activities.I love family and the bonds, but damn it, do NOT hold someone back from their dreams because of your own pasts. If you do, you're just as evil as the evil you're trying to conceal.Additionally, while family is important, dreams matter. Remember that.Coco is an ingenious and courageous film with a TON of heart. It doesn't solve the world's problems or show people need to be as creative as their souls want them to be, but it will blend the worlds and still show forgiveness is key to expanding your universe.***Final thoughts: This is my friend's favorite Pixar movie. I agree that it's FANTASTIC and I loved almost every minute. No buts here. It's incredibly awesome and KRRRRR!", "The movie had some beautiful moments, but it was very predictable, at times unbeleivably boring and it missed the mark for me as for whom the movie is meant for. Not quite a childrens movie for it has so much \"drama\", but not deep enough a storyline to be for older audience. I appreciate Pixar for highlighting different cultures such as Mexican culture in this one, but many of these reviews are biased for that exact reason.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "The movie was fun!

A masterpiece.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I am a huge fan of animation films. Whenever I feel bad or in the need of a friend, I choose an animation film and watch. After I finish it, I feel recharged and energetic. \"Coco\" has been on my list for a very long time, and finally I have decided to watch it last night. This was one of the best decisions I have taken for some time. This morning I woke up smiling and, so far, I am having a very good day. This is all because of this beautiful animation film. \"Coco\" is produced by Pixar. When you see this name, you should probably think about; Toy Story series, Cars series, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc, Monsters University, Inside Out, Up and WALL-E. All these films have a classic story wrapped around an emotional content. In my opinion, this emotional content is the trademark of Pixar made films. In these animations, almost all the time, you hear beautiful music, witness unbelievably creative visual effects, bright colors and powerful voice cast stars, but the story is almost always a classic one and the weakest point of the chain. This, however, doesn't apply for \"Coco\". \"Coco\" has an original story as well as all the other features I have counted above. This is the reason why it has won two Academy Awards, Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Picture (Original Song: Remember Me) and Best Animated Feature Film, and while I am writing this review, it is the 63th best film on IMDB's top 250 films. \"Coco\" is directed by Lee Unkrich and co-directed by Adrian Molina. Lee Unkrich is also known as the main director of Toy Story 3 and co-director of Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc. \"Coco's\" beautiful story is also written by him. \"Coco\" has a runtime of 105 minutes and grossed up to $807 Million against a budget of $175-200 Million. Just by looking at this huge budget, you can understand the importance of animation films for the cinema industry.\"Coco\" is born out of the original idea of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the dead). This day is celebrated in Mexico between October 31, and November 2, every year. The idea is to remember the dead in the family. People go to cemeteries, they build private altars containing their favorite foods and beverages. In the film, during this period, deceased watch their relatives while enjoying the foods and drinks. It is also believed that when a deceased person is forgotten by everyone, only then he truly dies. So, the true meaning of death is when you are forgotten by your family, friends and loved ones. The film opens with Imelda's husband leaving Imelda and his 4-year-old-daugter \"Coco\" to make a career in music. Since then, this man is the most hated person in the family and music is forever forbidden. To survive, Imelda starts making shoes and this becomes the family's official business throughout the generations. After many years, great-great grandson of Imelda, Miguel, at the age of 12, secretly dreams of being a musician finds out that his great-great grandfather managed to become a worldwide famous musician. When this family secret is revealed to him, he goes to the mausoleum of his great-great grandfather to borrow his guitar to perform in the talent show; there he accidentally enters in the land of the dead and starts to seek for his great-great grandfather to get his blessing to become a musician. As an additional note for the film, dead are shown as skeletons and they have colorful drawings on their faces. I enjoyed the depiction of the dead people very much. They seem to go on living their lives in pretty much the same way.In Pixar films, you get to receive a lot of meaningful messages. Those messages are generally universally known. This rule doesn't change when it comes to \"Coco\" either. It hides the message of self-trust. It reminds you to keep going after your dreams no matter what. There will always be people who will try to bring you down, but if you keep believing in yourself, you will always get what you want. Thanks to these motivational messages, Pixar films always hides extra boost for the audience, in them. When Miguel enters in the land of the dead, everywhere is as colorful as a rainbow. This contra belief creates and amazing ambience and atmosphere for the film. Death is believed to be a sad thing, but those bright and colorful and happy cities of the dead, prove this concept wrong. \"Coco\" is also praised for respecting the original traditions of Mexico. The film shares its knowledge about this culture. Just like any decent film, \"Coco\" follows a story with beginning, developing and ending. There is absolutely no difference between animated and non-animated films in the means of story anymore. For all these reasons I have mentioned above, \"Coco\" is one of the most beautiful animation films I have ever seen.", "One of the best animated movie by pixar. Very realistic character depiction.

To introduce such a complex world and set of rules, exposition is the order of the day and Coco is slow to get moving. This was also the case with the opening of Inside Out but Wall-E managed to introduce a wholly different world with minimal effort. Once established, and 12-year-old Miguel is transported to the Land of the Dead, the film is nothing short of a joyful and emotional journey through a genuinely interesting story intrinsically linked to a culture which holds family and loved ones so dear.As in many a Pixar caper, you can never quite predict when the emotional gut punches are going to hit - and believe me, there are more than a couple here - you only know it when you're in the middle of a scene and suddenly a tear rolls down your cheek (I dare you not to cry during the final scenes between the young Miguel and Mama Coco).\n \nThe story moves along at a slow pace to begin with but picks up once Miguel meets his skeletal relatives and goes at full whack through the final act before it takes its time to wrap up the loose ends and leave you with an incredibly satisfying tear running down your cheek (or else you're not human!). Likewise, in typical Pixar fashion, the twists and turns in the plot seem plainly obvious in hindsight but when it's moving at the pace that Coco does, you never get a chance to second guess what'll happen next.It's arguably the studio's most controversial 100 minutes to date as well - not everyone was enamoured with the idea of introducing death to a young audience when the film was first announced. However, the message that's trying to get across is that no-one truly dies if they are remembered by those who loved them in life and cherish their memories in death. Just expect a few soul-searching and ancestral-based questions from your little ones in the days following them watching it.To be this deliberately life-affirming but equally obsessed with death (even today, a bizarrely taboo topic of discussion) is a tricky high wire for any film to pull off. Coco, in no small way, nails it. \n \nBest Quote: \"You don't have to forgive him, but we shouldn't forget him!\"", "This movie is a masterpiece. Pixar is genius. The world of the dead comes to live in this movie. Mexico also comes alive, from the pan dulce to the streets of tiny mexican towns. I think this movie is great for everyone to watch. It helps teach people a little bit of mexican culture and how beautiful it is. It also helps teach kids about death and how it's apart of us and can be celebrated.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "I love this movie the colors in the movie are beautiful I love the music you fall in love with the characters What I liked more about it is it gives you a since of what family is all about family stays together know matter what.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This movie is a masterpiece.

It's something that had never happened to me before, in no movie, whether it's animation (which I love to madness), or not). Initially, seeing the trailers, I didn't think that I would have liked it so much (I thought that yes, I would have definitely liked it (if we talk about Disney and Pixar, then, it's more than certain), but not so markedly), and I didn't think it could be so tragic, deep, hard, sweet, joyful and delicate at the same time... it's a movie that bewitches you, literally. Takes so many topics in depth, that Coco is really a movie with many levels of reading, which has so many meanings, so many moral, so many emotions, in short, has a very complex plot (although it may not seem, especially at the beginning, then), and this made me appreciate it even more. Also, I think it's the movie that, more than any other, embodies both the Disney and Pixar soul, in a simply perfect marriage, and I love all that... and for this reason, for me, Coco is Pixar's most interesting, flowing and engaging movie. It's wonderful then, beyond all this, how the Mexican culture, and specifically, the \"Dia de Los Muertos\", has been represented, respected and honored in this movie... really, you can see and hear how much love they made for this movie, how much they put on theirs to respect this beautiful party... they did it so well, that now I'm much more curious about Mexican culture than I was before. Coco is a movie that makes you think, also, and after every vision of the movie, it makes you think long... well, this movie is a rich experience, a journey, this is more than safe. Then it's useless to say of the graphics, the colors, the settings, the atmospheres (I love it's so dark and psychedelic, but at the same time, joyous), the animations, the design... are nothing short of exceptional. And music, oh music is something positively impressive! The soundtrack is creepy and all the songs, in addition to remain in your head for a long, long time (even just for their beautiful music and for being very Mexican), have various very beautiful meanings, and various levels of reading, depending on the context and/or use of the instrumental part of the song itself, particularly \"Remember Me\", is a monstrous song, perfectly embodies the main messages that wants to send the movie, in addition to be very poignant... I also love so much \"Proud Coraz\u00f3n\", wow, really beautiful... It's perfectly visible that the music is the basis of the story. And I haven't said anything of the characters yet... the characters are perfectly characterized, have a lot of facets and are very credible, not to mention H\u00e9ctor, which is nothing short of amazing for me! (Not for nothing, he became my favorite movie character of all time, and besides, I love his story and his character)... but also Miguel, Imelda, Coco and Ernesto are great characters, no doubt (I also love Dante, Pepita and Abuelita, however). I also appreciate how, in this movie (but Pixar is more than good in this, even though here, for me, has reached its climax), just a dialogue of a minute or just a scene can give importance to a thing or a character that before had little, if any, relevance... wow really, I am speechless. All this movie is \"speechless\"... the way it enters you, in the heart and soul, being both delicate and overbearing, is something I had never seen in another movie, and, of course, I really appreciate it all that. Coco is a movie where EVERYONE can identify and relate with someone and/or something, and this does nothing but increase its value even more... it's, moreover, the most moving and profound movie I've ever seen (I cried at least 75% of it)... deals with themes like life, death, life beyond death, memory, forgiveness, love, family, oblivion, the power of music, heritage, traditions, dreams, friendship (but also many many others), in a truly impeccable and enviable way. I find it to be a perfect movie, an example of how a movie should be created. For all this, I really think it's an AWESOME movie and is a MASTERPIECE with a capital M, and I'm shocked that it wasn't AT LEAST nominated for \"Best Picture\"... I'm sorry, for me is an unacceptable thing. But I'm super happy that he won at least in his two nominations, because he deserved fully, by a landslide. And nothing, for those who haven't yet seen it, do it as soon as possible, otherwise you don't know what you're missing! It's a movie for everyone, it has so much joy, love and truth in itself, so look at it, and surely, like me, after the vision, you'll feel better, I'm sure.", "Just watched it and I was first of all amazed by the incredble animation!!!!!

Most movies don't deserve 1 star, and people who rate this low are obviously going by their own biased opinions that don't make any sense.

For every Inside Out it feels like we are given two unnecessary Cars sequels. They are at their best when they let the quality storytelling drive everything else, which is exactly the case with Coco. While this effort may not be their best to date, it is certainly one of their most balanced.The premium placed on aesthetics places it up near the top with Ratatouille and WALL-E in that regard. The tear jerking climax puts it in the same conversation as strongest emotional connection along with the opening love scene from Up, the incinerator scene from Toy Story 3, and the cathartic culmination of Inside Out. The aspiring guitar player story and incorporation of great original songs makes it one of their most memorable in regards to musicality. Finally, the messages of mortality, valuing family, pursuing dreams, and celebration of Mexican culture feels like it's one of their most necessary and timely stories in the context of our current political climate.", "REVIEW: I loved this movie.

This sets off a chain of events, resulting in Miguel entering the afterlife and needing to get Ernesto's blessing to re-enter the living world.Sweet, entertaining movie from Disney and Pixar. Energetic with an emotional ending and some interesting takes on family, loss and memories.Not brilliant - it is slanted more towards kids than adults. Once the afterlife segment starts it relies a lot on cheap sight gags involving skeletons' body parts. The middle section feels like your usual kids' adventure story, with predictable, action-based plot development.

Not only it's a lavish and beautiful drama fantasy, it is also, in part, a pretty sneaky mystery film as well, that doesn't seem like one at first glance. The film scattered an obscure string of Chekov's guns throughout in a way that one would treat casually yet not completely miss, only to have all these details unexpectedly tie into the final revelation. And with the superb work gone into building all these characters and the world itself, the emotional impact of the revelation becomes tenfold. Kudos to the directors, story supervisors and writers of this all-round intelligent film -- or I might just overthinking it. The 3D animation is pretty seamless, almost life-like, but most of all, the art direction is a grand visual feast, most notably its portrayal of the Land of the Dead, which is not just pure world-building, but also an integral part of the story's emotional core (yes, that includes the immigration counters). On top of that, there is music by Michael Giacchino, the man behind the music of 'The Incredibles', 'Ratatouille' and 'Up', and the Lopez duo, who wrote the songs of 'Frozen'. Not only is 'Remember Me' a pretty great song, the way it is portrayed and used throughout the movie is pretty smart. When it first played, there was fanfare and celebration and glitter all over, almost like a pop song consumed by the masses -- almost quite narcissistic -- which later became one of the few inspirations for our protagonist, only to be later stripped down to its core, revealing the meaning of the song, and it's deep-rooted connection to the themes of the movie. A song that is in of of itself a character of the story.

Damn great films, just when you think you've seen them all, there comes a little gem of imagination that catches you off guard and grab you by the heart and plunge you in a universe that look magnificent on screen yet the magnificence is nothing compared to the inner beauty of the story.\"Coco\" starts with your \"typical\" Disney family, but you've got to love how atypical they are from Disney standards, yet typical in an archetypical way. The Riveras, four generations of proud shoemakers and perhaps the only Mexican people to have banished music from their life... because the previous matriarch of the family was abandoned by her husband to pursue his career as a singer (the backstory-sequence is colorfully rendered in the beginning). The singer died, Music became a taboo and a golden rule was to never mention his name, ever. His last connection with the world of the living is Mama Coco, the great-grandmother of Miguel.Miguel is also your \"typical\" rebellious kid, his dream is to become a musician, he loves music and his idol is the great Ernesto de la Cruz, a crooner-idol who died too soon in a freak accident. \"Seize your moment\" is the legend's motto, a hymn to every dreamer who wants to be a doer. And even if the phrasing conveys some opportunistic undertones, we want to embrace it, because well, isn't that the most valuable lesson to teach kids? (especially when you have every member of a family leagued against a child, wasting his talent).But this isn't exactly what the writers of \"Coco\" had in mind... sure, the Riveiras strike as quite annoying dream-killers, sure, music is important but it's less an end than a mean, a mean to reconcile the present with the past, to resurrect memories that have been buried in a ground of misunderstanding and bitterness. The magic of \"Coco\" is to translate matters of life, family and death into fantasy elements and dazzling visuals, just like \"Inside Out\" did with life and family period.\"Don't forget me, I'll always be there\" says a dying character while pointing his index on his beloved one's heart, it's a common clich\u00e9 but it's the only relief one could take with him to the 'long road\". And \"Coco\" turns it into a simple but heartbreaking song, \"Remember me\" and it says a lot about our deepest needs in lif... whether you believe in it or not, after watching \"Coco\", you just want to believe in an afterlife that allows to live as long as you're being remembered... aren't we all in the same boat after all?Maybe not. Maybe fame is the ultimate the antidote against oblivion. Maybe that's why many people dream of posterity... yet \"Coco\" doesn't say that posterity doesn't matter, it just says that it doesn't matter the way you think it does. And it simply gives a meaning to the idea of being part of a family in case some of us have forgotten. We don't choose our families, but they're part of our DNA, it's there from the start and no matter how far we go, we can never forget where we started especially when we want to move forward. Remember Mufasa's words to Simba about forgetting himself.Miguel sees his future in music, and his journey takes him to the Land of the Dead, where dead people are much alive, hanging on the memories of their families and their celebration during the 'Day of the Dead', the only occasion for them to visit the real world in a night where their pictures are surrounded with personal items, candles and flower petals. Ever since Disney's seminal \"Dance of Skeletons\", there seems to be a mix of fascination and revulsion with the world of the dead Disney. But it's only fitting that a universe that killed so many characters could provide us a light of hope and allow the dead to show up once in a while like in \"The Lion King\".Maybe it's a clever way to tell kids that death isn't final, the real death one when we're forgotten, maybe the reasons humans live long enough to see their grandchildren grow is to being remembered for a much longer time. The adventure in the world of the Dead with Hector, all the dead Riveras and de la Cruz is an adventure like only Disney animators at the top of their game can provide, but the film reminded me of many other life-changing classics that made me think.\"It's a Wonderful Life\" made me wish more people could forgive themselves for so-called failures, \"Back to the Future\" warned me that a simple choice can lead to failure and there was no coming back. \"Coco\" filled my mind with similar thoughts, so many people die without coming to terms, living apart while they have so much to share and so many grandchildren don't realize what a blessing having grandparents still alive because we're blinded by ego or by dreams.This is how the film spoke to me, we all wish to accomplish big things but sometimes, instead of seizing the moments, we make the \"wise\" choice... in a world that cherishes dreamers, starting with Disney... so we spend our life blaming ourselves for these choices. \"Coco\" made me feel like Dorothy ended up saying \"There's no place like home\", the film moved me and made me feel a little better with my choices... and that was something I didn't see co-coming.", "I am a big fan of animation movies and I use to watch movies constantly but really I have never seen such a beautiful emotionally stimulated movie, his marvelous story combined with a considerable amount of emotion that follow the teaching pattern to the children as well as the adults about the importance of the family in the one's life, all of this mixed with the colorful tasted motion pictures that present this movie as one of the best movies ever produced in Cinerama industry, it is not my mere opinion, my wife as well as my son has the same opinion, also the movie has viewed in my son school and there were too many attendants from different ages and all has only one unified opinion \"there is tremendous amount of feelings mixed with very well animated pictures, I will give him 10 and I amglad for your readings of my review.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This is probably one of the best animated films I've seen in some time, though I never would have watched if not for seeing it praised in somebody's must-watch list.Let's get the handful of flaws out of the way first. That is a terrible title. It conveys nothing useful, inspires no intrigue, and is utterly forgettable. The premise is also insanely bizarre. The entire conflict in the film comes from a matriarch forbidding multiple generations of her family from music. Remarkably though, that almost makes sense in this movie, probably because the characters are charming and realistic, and the Mexican setting is bright and exuberant. In regard to the nonsensical anti-music setup, this is the anti-Hollywood movie. Where Hollywood starts with an interesting premise then devolves into hackneyed and formulaic storytelling, Coco starts with nonsense, just to let it get to the fun parts.But the rest of the movie is fun. At first, it seems like a standard Wizard of Oz style quest to go home, but then twists it with mild, but satisfying surprises. There are gags throughout, but they're folded seamlessly into the story and the universe. Even if they don't necessarily add to the plot, they importantly never deviate from it. The plot itself is satisfying and cathartic, even if predictable. One of the film's strongest aspects though is the emotional attachment it manages to evoke in the audience. There are several moments of intense both intense sadness and joy. Unlike so many movies, you genuinely feel happy to have shared in these imaginary characters' lives.Probably the most remarkable thing about the movie, however, is that it is such an impressive way of helping kids deal with death and mortality in both a non-horrifying and non-trivial way. Most likely just as the Mexican \"Day of the Dead\" the plot is based around is meant to do.

You only accepted the cream of the crop. And when I saw the trailers for Coco, I didn't waste any time, even before I went to see it at the theater, I automatically rated it 10 stars, because I knew it was automatically going to be great. After what I saw? Congratulations, Pixar, you created the very first Pixar movie I do not like. Let me explain. I've been around long enough on this planet to know, some films deserve hype, and some films don't deserve hype, but get hype. That's Coco, ladies and germs! It wasn't bad, but there's no way in any corner of this universe that you can convince me this is a 10 star winner. Please disregard those reviews, it just doesn't math up to what Pixar used to be, and this movie confirms for me the beginning of the bloodbath for Pixar altogether. ( Anything left for you to ruin now, Disney? My dinner is on the stove!)

We learn that the young lad, Miguel, is related to this sensation, and Miguel has a deep love for music, but every time he tries to pick up a guitar, he is shunned upon, mainly by his senile granny. When his guitar is broken purposely, he finds out at the same time that a concert is playing, and that he should audition. He would love to, but he doesn't have a guitar, so he sneaks off to the museum where the real legendary guitar is kept, and attempts to steal it for the audition. With no explanation on how it happens, he is transported to the land of the dead, where the movie itself falls dead in its tracks. I'm sorry, but I thought this was going to be a musical, and 45 minutes in, I only heard one song, \"Remember Me\", ironically sang by the victim of the bell. ( Bell not secure, the guitar not secure to the wall, do you guys secure anything in this movie?) The humor I was expecting fell flat, falling victim to recycled slapstick humor I used to laugh at in the 80's. The last half of the movie was dull, weak and boring, and too predictable.

I'd say this is probably in tie with my other favourite Pixar film (Ratatouille). The ending is very sweet and a little bit sad, and the music is beautiful. Please give it a watch, you won't be disappointed!", "Based on an original idea by Lee Unkrich (who directed Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo) and co-directed by him and Adrian Molina (a Pixar storyboard artist who was directing his first film), Coco is all about a 12-year-old Mexican child named Miguel. He dreams of being a musician while the rest of his family is content to make shoes and wonders why he should care so much about his family history as the Day of the Dead draws near.Miguel figures out that Ernesto de la Cruz (voiced by Benjamin Bratt when he speaks and Antonio Sol when he sings) is his great-grandfather whose leaving the family made everyone hate music. He steals the revered man's guitar and runs to the plaza to enter a talent contest. However, he has crossed over to the land of the dead and must now reconnect with the relatives he never wanted to know about, earn the respect of his great-grandfather and get back to our world before the sun rises.Along with the con artist H\u00e9ctor, who is being forgotten by his family in our world, Miguel will learn the truth about his family, his culture and the music that he loves. I don't really want to spoil much more than that - this movie was pure joy from start to finish.This film took six years to make - much longer than other Pixar movies. You can really see the care on the bonus features, where we learn about the inspiration for Dante, the Xoloitzcuintli dog.Coco also features many Mexican celebrities, including El Santo, Cantinflas, Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Emiliano Zapata, Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix and painter Frida Kahlo, who saved the Xolo dog breed along with her husband, Diego Rivera. Dante is also inspired by that. Director Lee Unkrich claims that there are more celebrities hidden within the land of the dead, too.Boasting a cast rich with authentic latino voices, the lone exception is John Ratzenberger, Pixar's good-luck charm, who has been in every one of their films. Here, he plays a skeleton whose dentist remembers him in the living world.What really struck me was the gorgeous near-realism of the animation, which contrasted with the cartoony elements. This is the first time that I've felt that computerized animation is on a par with the traditional cel era.This is a bit rough for kids in parts, but ten-year-olds or older should be able to handle it.

It displayed the women as housewives basically, when Latin American women have made big strides in equality. For example, \"Women have made great progress towards equality with men, especially in schools, workplaces, and politics.\" (\"Wonder Women in Land of Macho Men\", 2015). This quote explains how women have earned better roles in society and in their families. They are also getting more jobs than they used to, including more influence in politics and higher power jobs. They have been given chances, and they took full advantage of them. Furthermore, \"In the past quarter-century, the proportion of women in the workforce has risen more in Latin America than in any other region.\" (\"Wonder Women and Macho Men\", 2015). This quote shows that the Latin American women have made huge progress in their careers per se. I feel Coco should have shown this in the movie so it doesn't look like the men are doing all the work outside the house, and the women are stuck inside doing all the house chores. In my opinion, the Latin American women deserve the credit they aren't receiving.", "I think that the latest Disney Pixar movie Coco shows a culturally correct representation of Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead). In the movie, 12 year old Miguel Rivera is in love with music. He wants to see his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz but he has to cross from the living to the dead in order to see him. In the movie, people celebrate the day by dancing, decorating their loved one's graves, making altars with decorations to celebrate their passed loved ones, and by celebrating with many family members. \n There are many examples of how this correctly corresponds to how people actually celebrate Dia de Los Muertos. Families do a lot of many different things together to celebrate this holiday. Global Issues in Context states, \"Families also visit their local cemeteries, usually from the night of Nov. 1 throughout the following day to clean their tombs, place fresh flowers, light candles, and even share a meal with the visiting souls\" (\"Global Issues in Context, 2017\"). The movie portrayed many families doing these traditions. Many families put candles and flowers near their deceased relatives graves, and invited their family member's souls to eat their favorite foods for dinner with them. Many families in the Latino culture have different views on their loved ones' passing, and celebrate instead of mourn their loss. According to the Literature Resource Center, \"The Day of the Dead is not a day of mourning but a day of celebration, feasting, and colorful altars built for the memories of loved ones\" (\"Literature Resource Center, 2008\"). This was represented perfectly in the film because every family was hanging out with each other and decorated altars with their loved ones pictures. They weren't sad that their loved ones were gone, but instead celebrated their time in life and death, and gave them gifts that were things that the person liked when they were living. The way that Latinos view heaven and seeing their family members pass is different than how many Americans view heaven. Helene Henderson claims that, \"Many Mexicans believe that the spirits of the dead return to enjoy a visit with their friends and relatives on this day\" (Henderson, 145). In the movie, the spirits of family members walk across a bridge made of the flower of death to go celebrate with their family and this is also believed by some Latino families in the real world. Also in the movie, many families are seen dancing and singing along to music for their deceased loved ones and to help them find their family. This happens in the real Latino culture as well. According to Tony Johnston, \"The people dance, sing, and share memories of their loved ones, welcoming their spirits who are thought to return briefly to take part in the celebration\" (Johnston, 1997). In the movie, many families were seen eating, playing games, and talking to each other with the spirits of loved ones. They believe that they can possibly see their loved ones again, and that they are always with them. The families make the ofrendas personal for the deceased by putting up pictures, drawings, and sometimes their favorite foods and drinks to remind them of the things they enjoyed in life. Tribune Business News suggests, \"The ofrendas include pictures of the deceased, flowers and plates with meals and drinks they used to love\" (Tribune Business News, 2007). Many of the ofrendas shown in the movie also had pictures of the deceased, food, and drinks that the family members onced loved. I rate the way that CoCo culturally showed Dia de los Muertos a 9/10. I rate the movie culturally a 9/10 because it showed families celebrating in ways that families in the Latino culture celebrate the holiday.", "The Latino movie, Coco, focuses on a boy's journey to find the missing face on his families ofrendas but also includes the Latino annual tradition of remembering their loved ones who have passed. Coco explains the Latino culture easily for young kids to understand the Day of the Dead. This movie represents the culture and traditions of The Day of the Dead correctly, however, some parts of this holiday is missing. \n The biggest tradition is the ofrendas. In the movie, it is portrayed as it would in the regular world. The ofrendas are something mostly to all Latino families puts up in their house. Some families keep it up year round to always have the remembrance of their ancestors. Others make it a tradition and family bonding time to make their ofrendas more meaningful. In an editorial about The Day of the Dead the ofrendas are a big part of the tradition. \"People who celebrate the holiday prepare ofrendas, or altars, in honor of their departed family members\" (Anonymous, 2007). Deceased family is very important to those of the Latino culture. The ofrendas is made with the things the ancestors liked. Majorly, the favorite foods of the ancestors are laid out on the ofrendas.\n Alike the ofrendas, cemeteries where the deceased ancestors lie are the gathering places of dead to living on this annual holiday. This is a place for the dead to see their family again. In Coco, this is really well explained by illustrating through the dead as ghosts and looking out over their sons and daughters with their own kids. It was not only realistic, but you could clearly understand what was happening. From a Day of the Dead editorial the author states \"cemeteries are a comfortable space to allow the spirits to gather and enjoy themselves on Earth once again,\" (Anonymous, 2007). Cemeteries are \"reconnecting stations\" of the living and the dead. Although the living cannot physically see the dead, they know they are there and Coco expresses this in a positive way. The movie shows how only the dead can see the living and how no one is ever sad, but always happy in the presence of each other. This tradition is shown very clearly and I agree that it would be the strongest connection the movie has to real life.\n An important element of of The Day of the Dead is lacking in Coco. In the movie, it only shows one day of the holiday when in reality it lasts three days. Each day is for a different age group. An article written by Diane Stoneback titled The Morning Call explains that \"The Day of the Dead actually last three days it begins October 31 when the spirits of the angelitos (little children who have died) start returning. They are gone by November 1 (all souls day) when the adult spirits begin coming back. The oldest spirits leave by November 2 (all Saints Day)\" (Stoneback, D1). This fact about this holiday is something that shouldn't be skipped over. Each family member should remembered on their own day, but was not portrayed during the movie. With this tradition of The Day of the Dead it would have been more realistic and maybe even a little more fun for young children to see that culture idea. \n Overall Coco represents The Day of the Dead in a realistic and true representation to the non-fictional world. Although it is lacking a key component to the Latino holiday this movie still positively shows the culture. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn more about Latino culture without watching super historical movies.", "The film Coco, a powerful movie made by Pixar about Latino culture specifically celebrating the Day of the Dead or Dia de los Muertos. In this review I will be comparing the traditions for the Day of the Dead shown in the movie, to real life traditions for the holiday. \n When you start up the film, on of the first things that you are given information on is the ofrenda. It is explained to be an altar for the deceased of your family. In the film it is shown with all the pictures of the dead, flowers, candles, drinks and food placed around it. Compared to real life, this is very accurate. Based off what I found, ofrendas are usually accompanied by the dead members' favorite food/drink, their picture, candles and flowers called marigolds(Trecker, Jamie). Another common tradition is the use of wearing handmade masks to honor the dead(Trecker, Jamie). This however, is not found in the film. None of the living characters seem to wearing any masks at all. The main character at one point does end up having a \"mask\" from makeup, but that's the only time we see this tradition in the film. Early on in the film, during the evening of the Day of the Dead, we see a bunch of families and people going to the local cemetery to put up things for the dead when they visit in order to please and honor them. This is a very common tradition for the Day of the Dead in real life. People visit the dead's graves to lay things like their favorite food/drink(Epifanio Cortes Cedillo). The previous mentioned marigolds, are a strong symbol throughout the whole movie. In real life, the marigold is laid out for the dead in order to lead/guide them to their families home, and to the living world(Nutini, Hugo G). This is shown very strong in the movie as there is a scene where the main character runs from his home to the cemetery, and the whole way is followed by marigold pedals, so their family's deceased can find the way home. The marigold pedals are also shown as bridges for the dead to get from the land of the dead to the land of the living.\n All in all, Coco is an excellent movie that represents the Day of the Dead's traditions very well, with very accurate representations of everything. Based of of how it compares to real life.", "The latest Disney Pixar Movie Coco was based around the spanish holiday Dia de Los Muertos. It shows lots of traditions that are a part of the normal life in Mexico. It represents all of them really well. Some of them are in big parts in the story and others are small details. During the first part of the movie they show paper cut outs showing a story. This is very common during that time of year. According to \"Mexico.\" Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of World Holidays, edited by Robert H. Griffin and Ann H, \"Artisans are famous for their carefully cut tissue banners, which are displayed to welcome the spirits of the dead. Designs are cut into as many as fifty sheets of tissue paper at a time.\" They show lots of the paper designs in the intro and this quote shows that the movie was accurate with the paper tissues. One of the small issues with the movie is when they have dinner. Mexico.\" Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of Foods and Recipes of the World, edited by Susan Bevan Gall and Kathleen J. Edgar states that, \"Cena, supper, is typically a light meal eaten after 9 p.m,\" In the movie they eat a large meal with lots of different foods. I think they did this to show different types of food but they could have shown that during a different part of the movie. G\u00f3mez, Edwin. \"Latino Leisure Lifestyles.\" Encyclopedia of Recreation and Leisure in America, edited by Gary S. Cross says, \"Leisure and recreation for Latinos tend to be very social. In general, Latinos participate in recreational activities in larger groups than other Americans, and these groups are composed of family members, extended family members, and close friends.\" They show this in the movie during the main characters Home life. He lives with all of his family. He eats, sleeps, works, and celebrates with all of his family. This was portrayed very accurately by Pixar in multiple scenes. Over all I give the movie an 8.5/10 on accuracy of Latino traditions. The only downside was the meal but it was only a minor thing. Pixar did an excellent job representing Latino tradition.", "In the cartoon movie CoCo (directed by Lee Unkrich), a young boy named Miguel (Voice by Anthony Gonzalez) tries to find his voice in being a musician meanwhile celebrating his ancestors in day of the dead. During day of the dead (From October 31st to November 2nd) the latino culture celebrates and honors their past ancestors. Due to a rough past in Miguel's family's past, they decided to not enjoy music like the rest of the culture does in the time of celebration because of how a great great grandpa left the family for his love of music. Miguel's family found that as a disgrace and decided not to honor him or his music. So later on Miguel realizes he has a passion for music and he wants to share it with everyone. His family disagrees with this passion but despite that, Miguel's feelings got the best of him and he tries to steal his great great grandpa's guitar (voice played by Benjamin Bratt). It turned out the guitar had magical powers so he then magically transfers to a colorful world of his past ancestors, away from his current family. Miguel meets his past ancestors and sees their past. Later with a blessing from Miguel's great great grandmother, he goes back to the current world and lives happily after. CoCo does a good job with making sure most of the movie's events matchup with what the Latino culture does. It's easy to tell the director paid close attention to this. The only choke point of this movie is that in the Latino culture, it is not believed that a living person can go back and visit their ancestors in there world. Obviously this is just a cartoon catering to a very young age group so it at the end of the day it doesn't make a huge impact on the movie. It's mind candy for the little children. All things aside, overall CoCo is a well done children's movie that resembles a lot of the Latino culture and helps others learn about it. I recommend this movie to little children whose parents want them entertained for a few hours.", "Disney's Coco illustrates an overall accurate view of Mexican culture. Obviously, it's not one hundred percent spot-on and it has some misleading aspects, but the film overall is accurate in portraying Latino culture. More specifically, the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead or D\u00eda de los Muertos. An example from CultureGrams.com states, \"During D\u00eda de los Muertos, families gather to celebrate life while they honor the dead, sweep graves, build special altars to honor the newly dead, and place items such as flowers, cakes, and soda next to photos of loved ones in their homes. Graveyards become the place for large parties with fruit punch and concerts.\" (\"Mexico: Holidays\"). This is clearly shown in the film. Many aspects of this quote are directly related to the film. For example, the main character, Miguel, and his family setup altars and photos of dead loved ones in their home. These altars, referred to in the movie as \"ofrendas\", represent many similarities to those made today in Latino culture. These include candles, flowers and foods. Another example from the quote that directly relates to the film are families going to visit graveyards. In the film, families visit the spirits of their dead loved ones in graveyards. These spirits cross over from the Land of the Dead. This portion of the movie creates fun, entertaining characters while emphasizing the importance of connecting with dead loved ones. Obviously, there is a much brighter, colorful, Disney interpretation of this, but it shows a culturally accurate part of the holiday. Overall, Coco had a very accurate, fun and exciting portrayal of Day of the Dead, however, as an audience I was personally left with some minor confusion. This quote from Ricardo Sandoval claims, \"On Nov. 1 and 2, entire families continue the centuries-old tradition of laying out the welcome mat for departed loved ones. The first day is for departed children, and the second for adult relatives. Mexicans tidy up and decorate gravesites of relatives. Many even sleep next to graves, knowing that sometime during the night they'll commune with the spirits. And if Mexicans can't make it out to graveyards, in-home altars guide the spirits home for their annual visit.\" (Sandoval 1). In the film, there was only one night of celebration shown. This quote goes against that, because in Mexico they celebrate Day of the Dead for three total days. Coco's plot had plenty of interesting twists and turns, but the overall storyline seemed to make a big deal on the timeline of these events. It emphasized a lot of importance on one day, and at sunrise the holiday was over. This led me to some confusion and can be seen as an inaccurate representation of the holiday.", "I LOVED this movie! Really refreshing to see a main character that is male! It also captured the spirit of dia de los muertos very well.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "\"Coco Montrese, in the challenge we were raised from the dead, but on the runway your Latino blood was muy caliente. You're safe.\nSeldom does a movie inspire me and propel me to what's best in filmmaking. Coco is one of those rare films you watch that become an instant classic. And yes, the lustful visuals and the upbeat and melodic songs are a great part of the experience but what makes this movie great, is its emotional sincerity, expertly complemented by Giacchino'a score. It's clear that this movie was based around a simple premise and a love for telling stories. And when that happens, everything else is so much easier. What Coco does fantastically and what so many movies fail to do is building a connective tissue that amounts to something greater than the movie itself, as if the fibres collide to do movie magic. When we reach the climax, it feels so earned because it's simple and because it's based on sincerity. Yes, the driving force of Coco comes from the beautifully apparent simplicity in its storytelling. It's a movie that is both a stunning visual spectacle and a touching piece of art. Also, in a time when racial segregation repeats its cycle of power, it's unusually brave to have an American studio make such a radiant homage to that culture, taking the pre-emptive measures for it to be an honour, not a steal. It comes as a surprise to nobody when I say that this film will leave you emotional (granted you belong to the human race). It's uncontrollable, it's within you to be moved when you have accompanied a character and watch the climax unfold and feel like you have earned the right to cry. And normally climaxes are huge and loud but Coco keeps it simple and quiet as moments that really strike a chord often are. What's also not so common is the movie's thematic lines, as you can't help to find incredibly brave that betrayal, murder and death are topics that the movie delves in profusely (yet never tackily). In the year in which Inside Out was release, that was, hands down, my favourite movie of the year. And, damn you Pixar, it will probably be again this year. At the end of the day, you sometimes go to the movies expecting a certain familiarity, something that you can rely on. Coco feels just like coming back to a loving home, it has the sweet scent of your grandmother's cake, it's as cosy as your childhood bedroom and it reminds us of the reason we keep coming back to these movies: to feel the warmth of the purest form of cinema.\"", "I have to admit, I haven't been in love with the last few Pixar movies. The Good Dinosaur, Cars 3, even Finding Dory was far more forgettable then I was expecting even though it was entertaining. Inside/Out was pretty terrific, but the midas touch appeared to be wearing off a little bit for this storied studio of animation. So, when I ended up going to see Coco almost unexpectedly, I didn't really have any set expecations for what I was going to experience. I had seen the teaser trailer way back in the summer, and my first thought was that it was kind of ripping off Book of Life, which I loved. After the interminable Frozen short before the film (which wasn't bad per se, but it was long, way too long to play before a 100 minute children's movie), Coco began and I was transfixed from start to finish. Beautiful, funny, full of heart and warmth, it earns it's tears at the end of this sweet story and will have you humming the songs for weeks to come, at least I have been.The film follows Miguel, a boy in a small town in Mexico, whose family's tragic past led them to ban all forms of music from their house, but that hasn't stopped Miguel from falling in love with the music and films of the most famous person to come out of their village, Ernesto De La Cruz. He sits in a hidden room and watches his movies and plays a beat down old guitar. This is one of the first places the movie really got me, because I play the guitar and this is the most realistic guitar playing that I have ever seen on film animation or otherwise, it's really brilliant to watch.Anyway, on the Day of the Dead, Miguel wants to enter a talent show, but his guitar is unsuable based on reasons that I will allow you to find out and he has to find one himself. His last resort is to borrow the guitar of De La Cruz, located in his mausoleum, which is a big no-no on the Day of the Dead. Stealing from the dead sends Miguel straight to the land of the dead, where he goes on a wild adventure with ancestors and other coloful characters to get back to the land of the living and hopefully play some music while he's at it.This movie is truly wondeful, a delight from start to finish with more heart than you can ever find in ten movies from other studios. I can't say that I'm particularly knowledgeable about Mexican Day of the Dead customs aside from the most superficial, but the film feels well-researched and respectful of the beliefs and customs of Mexico, and the characters come off as authentic, the voice acting is excellent, and again, the animators have truly outdone themselves in all aspects technically.***1/2 (out of four)", "The nitpicky asshats will point out why the movie's called Coco since they did the Legend of Zelda thing where the titular character isn't the protagonist and is instead a kid named Miguel. But that's not the point. I admit the movie gave off a bad first impression not simply because of Pixar's decline in quality in recent years but also because the teaser trailer gave off the impression that it was going to be a Book of Life knockoff. Although in that movie, he doesn't even die until the third act which trailers made the main selling point. However, that has always been Pixar's thing. The trailers make the movie look like your generic animated comedy but are more than that. And Coco is no exception. Once again, Pixar demonstrates how they're still the best in the business when it comes to modern animated movies. They're not terrified of moral guardians, something which even DreamWorks succumbed to after How to Train Your Dragon 2 despite what my opinions have to say about that. The animation is beautifully crafted. The animators once again worked their asses off and it shows. There's always a fine level of detail added. It deals with the themes of death from a child's perspective amazingly well and balances out slapstick antics with skeletons and a fine level of poignancy especially near the end of the movie. The music. Oh, God, the music. It's practically tearjerking. Bring some onions as an excuse for crying. Since most of Pixar's cast and crew was Latino, it showed that this was indeed Pixar's love letter towards Mexican culture, specifically Dia de los Muertos. Nothing feels like it's racist. There's is a predictable plot twist since we're constantly whacked on the head about a certain fact regarding Miguel's family but what movie hasn't done that? I think that was the writer's point. That you shouldn't make blind beliefs based solely off of pictures. Looks can be deceiving. Family comes first, all dreams have their own limitations, we should always consider the consequences of pursuing fame. And also, don't steal on the Day of the Dead if you're Mexican. Much like Inside Out and, to a lesser extent, Finding Dory, Coco shows that Pixar still hasn't lost their touch. Let's hope Incredibles 2 is just as awesome as the first movie. It has the same director though given Tomorrowland's reputation, we might have to be wary when going to see it. Only time will tell.", "Kids will love coco and most adults can enjoy it too.

This is taboo in his family who still greatly resent his great-great-grandfather for betraying his family to pursue fame and fortune via a musical career. During Mexico's famous Day of the Dead, a mishap has Miguel entering the spirit world of the dead in which he learns a lot about his family's history. (\"Coco\" is an animated Disney/Pixar production.)Firstly, this has to be one of the most beautiful animated films ever. The elaborate, multi-dimensional, brightly coloured settings in both the living and spirit worlds are - please pardon the pun - to die for. One highlight is a colourful, flying, jungle-cat spirit guide.The narrative has many adventurous twists and turns and it always stays within its theoretical structure of what life could be like in spirit world as well as how the spirits connect with the living. While this is engaging enough, the added humour is the icing on the cake. Such concepts include bureaucratic procedures of leaving and re-entering the spirit world. There are also numerous funny sight gags.Adding to the already brilliant story is a rich, well-developed array of characters - indeed, they were truly \"characters\" in every sense of the term. The story is enriched even further with a unifying theme: the caution against the relentless pursuit of fame and fortune at the expense of other, more important things.The story concludes with a scene that must be among the best of the year. Though the title character (Miguel's great-grandmother) is rarely seen, it is easy to see why the movie was named after her. Her special moment is a sincere tear-duct opener that also widely opens the heart. Truly memorable. The epilogue that follows this scene is also a delightful and intelligent conclusion.2017 must be one of the best years ever for animated films. \"The Breadwinner\" and \"Loving Vincent\" are also superb. Yet, \"Coco\" manages to top even these two great works. It lives up to the historical intention of Disney (with its younger aspirant Pixar) of appealing to the child in all of us - even those of us who've lived so long, we forgot what childhood enthusiasm felt like. In this way, everyone behind \"Coco\" is a hero for reviving such feelings long buried. This film joins \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"ET\" as classics whose premise involves a main character leaving \"home\" and spends the rest of the movie trying to get back.It was also great news to know that this Hollywood production was very accurate in its depiction of Mexican culture and folklore.

What can I say except 'de nada'...", "Coco is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It has a whole lot of heart, but never forgets to have fun either, taking us on a jam packed adventure, loaded with colour and spectacle. There are also plenty of sombre moments and, as you would expect from Pixar, some tearjerkers, the song Remember Me is a particular high point of the movie, which I am not afraid to admit had me holding back tears.However, as far as my standards for Pixar goes, it is nowhere near some of their best work. While it may be far superiour to recent movies, such as Brave and Cars 3, it comes nowhere close to the likes of Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Up, main reason for this being that I never truly cared for these characters, they were not as loveable as the likes of Mr. Incredible or Joy, and there was certainly no Mike Wozowski or Dug in the mix either, they were all a little flat.The voice cast is all around terrific, Anthony Gonzalez breaths a whole lot of life in to Miguel, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal brings a lot of richness to Hector, by far my favourite character in this movie, and Benjamin Bratt manages a lot of complicated layers to his character, Ernesto de le Cruz, with confidence and class.Not spectacular, but certainly left me smiling.

This is their finest work since game-changer Inside Out in 2015, again tackling complex themes most studios would shy away from exposing their young audience to, and doing so with a technical flourish and completely free from the white-washing so common in American films dealing with a culture and folklore from overseas. I'm not ashamed to admit that I wept like a baby at Coco, the first time I had done so since, again, Inside Out.Despite the title, our protagonist is Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez), a 12 year-old wannabe musician who seems destined to follow his elders into the family shoe-making business. 96 years earlier, Miguel's great-great-grandmother forbid the sound of music in their house when her song-writing husband left town in search of his dreams. As a result, Miguel is forced to teach himself guitar and worship his idol Ernest de la Cruz, a famous crooner who was killed in an unfortunate on-set accident, in secret. His grandmother Abuelita (Renee Victor) is keen to enforce the rule, literally shoeing away a mariachi who asks Miguel to play for him. His refusal to follow his family's ban leads to an argument and a supernatural encounter, after which Miguel can only communicate with those from the other side who have crossed over to take part in the Day of the Dead celebrations.Miguel's only hope of returning to his family before he fades away himself is with a magical marigold petal willingly handed to him by an ancestor. It doesn't take long to locate great-great-grandmother Mama Imelda (Alanna Ubach) and some other faces familiar from photographs, but the matriarch will only allow him to return if he promises to give up music forever. With the help of lovable scoundrel Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal) and a large-tongued stray dog, Miguel journeys across the Land of the Dead in search of the musician ancestor his family have been banished from mentioning. with only an old photograph with the face torn away for help. But could it be that Miguel was always destined to follow his muse, and that Ernest de la Cruz himself, who came from the very same town, may hold all the answers?Pixar take every opportunity to illuminate the screen once we cross over with Miguel into the bright, almost psychedelic land of his ancestors, which is protected by dazzling alebrijes and connects itself to our world by a glowing marigold petal bridge. Yet beneath the surface there is a richly textured script by Adrian Molina and Matthew Aldrich, complete with fully realised characters, fluid storytelling and heavily-researched attention to detail. Ana Ofelia Murguia as the titular Mama Coco does some stellar voice work, easing us into those lip-quivering final scenes assisted by Pixar's wonderful animation, as does Benjamin Bratt as the self-admiring de la Cruz, a man who does well for himself in a world in which you can only exist whilst you are remembered on the other side. And this being Disney, it wouldn't be complete without a signature song, and Remember Me, written by married team Kirsty Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez of Let It Go fame, is another winner. The song might be stuck in your head for days, but the emotional impact of this tale of family, music and death will last much, much longer.", "Our cultures are not so far off from each other's.

Knowing that the Disney films repeat the same themes over and over again, I did not expect this film to be something unique or outstanding. However, one thing that stood out to me was Miguel's passion for music even though he belongs to a family of humble shoemakers where music has been forbidden for generations. His perseverance for his dream is a spirit that everyone should learn or possess. \"Coco\" takes deeper than Miguel's passion for music and the importance of family, moreover, this movie stresses the conflict between inflexible rules and personal interests. It shows how we, Americans, have moved on from traditions and take liberty of our own lives.\n Despite of the violation of his family's rule, Miguel has taught himself how to play the guitar during his free time. He often hides in a secret room trying to watch and memorize lyrics from a black and white film he collected long time ago. On the day of the annual D\u00eda de Muertos talent show, his family discovers that he's doing the competition, and they smash Miguel's beloved guitar. Rather than giving up, Miguel sneaks into Ernesto de la Cruz's mausoleum in attempt to steal the star's guitar. Miguel unleashes a curse that forces him to travel to the Land of the Dead where he must find his family, receive their blessings, before being allowed to return home. Many conflicts rise in the Land of the Dead where Miguel finds his biological Great Great Grandfather, and Miguel is looking for ways to have his relatives forgive himself for violating the family rules and also forgive his Great Great Grandfather for leaving his family behind. Although Miguel has violated his family's strict violation, his surprising findings of his ancestors' history untied their deep hatred for his Great Great Grandfather and for music and brings the entire family back into union. Miguel's perseverance is a spirit that most of us lack of nowadays, and this movie is definitely a good choice for inspirations. \n Some of us still have the idea that adults are always right so whatever rules the adults set are unbreakable. In \"Coco\", rather than following the family tradition, Miguel takes his liberty and decides to not listen to the older adults in his family. He does not understand the wickedness in music and does not want to end his dream. Miguel's presence in the movie is an accurate representation of how young adults are standing today. They often have conflicts with their family leaving generation gaps with their parents. It is interesting to see how Miguel mirrors young adults nowadays. \n Although many Pixar films before have similar storyline as \"Coco\", however, Coco is definitely a movie that targets the emptiness in young adults' heart, teaching them to preserve and respect the memory with their family members. The movie begins with the same old same old where the main character faces oppositions for music and his guitar gets destroyed. His traveling to the Land of the Dead sparked some interest to me. And then he faces some more conflicts. The best part is the ending where his family regret for everything they did for music violation and the death of Coco and Coco's father. This scene truly touches the inner feeling of people's heart. I watched this movie with two of my other friends, and one of them teared in the end of the movie. She said \"This is so sad.\" I also had the same feeling but I just didn't express it. Even though the theme is cliche, to value every moment with other, this movie is definitely a great movie to watch with friends! \n The great music and colorful scenes add the finishing touch to the movie. These were the only reason why I did not fall asleep in the beginning of the movie because the colorful scenes are so vivid that I wished I was in that same world with Miguel. The extravagant world gives viewers, like me, interests to continue watching the move. The music are enjoyable and they also have good effects on the movie.", "Charming movie, really enjoied watching coco\nThanks pixar0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Things I have learned from the movie:1.

Trying to choose just one is going to be a difficult task. Even more so when you see a film like COCO in the mix.Years ago a musician in Mexico left behind his wife Imelda and their young daughter Coco to pursue his dreams of offering his music to the world. When he never returned his wife had to fend for herself becoming a shoemaker in their town. She passed her business on to her children along with the edict that no one would ever partake in or enjoy music in their family ever again.Flash forward several generations to the present where young Miguel feels a passion for music in his soul. With no outlet he hides his talents, listening to the music of Ernesto de la Cruz and watching his old videos. Cruz was a national treasure, beloved by all, whose music is remembered to this day.The annual Day of the Dead festival is fast approaching, a time when families gather together and honor their namesakes by placing pictures of them on the mantle surrounded by food and gifts when they return to look in on at their ancestors. Miguel is reminded of this by his grandmother, Coco's daughter, as she sets things in place with Coco sitting nearby, the oldest member of the family now.In the hope of showing his family how wrong they've been about music Miguel decides to enter the local talent show during the festival. Before he can do so he is discovered and his guitar smashed to pieces. At the same time he finds the picture of Imelda was folded and it appears de la Cruz was his Grandfather. With no instrument he decides to borrow the guitar of de la Cruz displayed in his crypt. But on this magical night when the dead are allowed to look in on their families touching the guitar sends him to the Land of the Dead.Miguel finds his family including Imelda. Still bitter she forbids him from pursuing music when she helps him return. Needing the blessing of a family member to return home, Miguel escapes Imelda and the rest, setting out to find de la Cruz with the help of Hector, someone who claims to know him. Their search reveals more than Miguel expected to learn as well as helping him to realize that family is indeed the most important thing there is. If only he can make it back to them.Disney and Pixar have come up with a meaningful story that doesn't rely on a standard fairy tale, incorporating the traditions and history of a culture taken for granted many times. Most of us may not be aware of the traditions of the Day of the Dead or know only about it on a superficial level seeing the painted skulls on display in movies and TV. By using this as the background for the story here they're opening up to many for the first time the richness and importance of the holiday.If the historical aspects themselves were not important enough the tale of the importance of family is one that should be heeded. In a world where young people toss aside their heritage and ignore the family structure in society this movie takes that concept and clings to it, showing that family is perhaps the most important thing there is in life. The support and love of family supersedes that of close friends, well intended politicians or anyone who feels they should be more important in your lives. In telling this story it shows the heart that is the center of a true family.But the story isn't the only thing to enjoy here. The Disney tradition of mind boggling animation, in any format, is still on display. The sumptuous colors seen here will dazzle the eye and capture your imagination. Miguel's first glimpse into the world of the dead is fueled by a combination of deep blues and bright oranges mingling together to show the city lit in celebration.When I first heard of this movie nothing piqued my interest. I'm delighted to report that even those unsure of whether to watch this film or not will find something to enjoy here. For me this is another great Disney movie to place on the shelf alongside the treasured classics of the past.UPDATE: Since this review was written COCO has gone on to win the 2018 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Original Song. Congratulations to the film makers behind this film, it was well deserved.", "I wasn't so sure of this movie but afterall I am in a big awe. It shows a love both for family and music.

I cried twice and tears are still falling down my cheeks whilst I'm writing this review. \nI must say, that the plot was really unexpected, there were some twists that I didn't expect and that's a rare thing when it comes to animations (same like in zootopia).\nAfterall, the moral this movie learns is to love both your family and music.

Some Mexican friends of ours saw it and were lavish in their praise. Miguel is a music-loving boy in perhaps the only family in Mexico that hates music. His great-great -grandfather left the family to pursue a career as a musician, and to make ends meet, his wife took to making shoes, and banished all music from the home. Miguel wants to enter the music contest for the Day of the Dead but his hopes are dashed, literally, when his grandmother smashes his homemade guitar. And this is why I give this a 9 rather than a 10. She's an utterly despicable, mean-spirited witch, and the rest of the family is too cowardly to stand up to her. At the end of the film she sheds a tear, a perfect example of what I call a Nazi With A Puppy Dog Moment, where a repugnant character gets a token humanizing moment.In desperation, Manuel \"borrows\" the guitar from the shrine to the most famous musician in the town's history, and in so doing he ends up crossing over to the Land of the Dead. Wow, is this a dazzling film. The color and intricacy of the Land of the Dead is beyond amazing. Miguel attempts to reach the spirit of the great musician, and in the process discovers that his great-great grandfather had been murdered and all his work stolen.A year later, at the next Day of the Dead, all Miguel's ancestors can now come back to visit, and his great-grandfather gets the credit he deserves.One figure that has pursued Miguel through his adventures was a gigantic spirit jaguar who looks terrifying but is actually benevolent. Anyway, during the next Day of the Dead, we see a dog and cat emerge from an alley. Look carefully at the shadows on the wall just before it happens.", "I just need to say \"Watch it\". It is enough.

He wants to pursue his dream of being a musician and accidently transports himself into the land of the dead. Where he has to seek his great great grandfather to return him back to living and to share the truth to his family about him.Pixar has made a comeback. They have been struggling with there sequels like Cars, and a boring The Good Dinosaur. Coco turned things for the better. It was a really good film. I am not sure if this one counts as a musical film as well. Since Miguel sings in a competition concert and a break out song. But the musical score was also beautifully done as well.The story and concept was great. It also explores the Mexican tradition of the day of the dead holiday. On why they celebrate it and there perspective on the living and the dead. Basically, families put out pictures of lost loved ones and their favorite foods and items by their pictures. And the spirit is able to come and visit the living if they are still remembered. Those who is slowly forgotten, they disappear from the land of the dead to another world.The film did a great job exploring the plot. And a boy's dream of being a musician while his family disapproved of and hoped he can join the family business of making shoes. The visual effects and animations is top notch beautiful. It is colorful, amazing, and eye candy to look at. When the land of the dead scenes are shown. Every skeleton design has decorations on them, or costumes, or the scenery of that world is just amusing. There was never a dull moment.The voice talent of Anthony Gonzalez did great as Miguel.

A bit of a Spanish song with some English was great.It is also a tearjerker when you actually care for these characters.

It was not as recognizable or memorable compare to his earlier work. Sadly, his music score in Good Dinosaur was more noticeable than this film.Overall, Coco is a really good film. Fun for the whole family. A plot and concept that explores the culture and tradition of the day of the dead which is really neat. The visuals and animation was beautiful and colorful.

Especially because I found that film to be incredibly good and the art so beautiful. I knew Coco would still be great, and that it would still be an original story (which it was), but I still can't help but still feel just a LITTLE disappointed that, being Pixar and all, they couldn't come out with something completely original. But, I realize that Hollywood is a small place, and I can't even imagine the politics of idea sharing there among the animated artist community. So, I wasn't AS excited about this film as I usually am, but its still my favorite Disney movie since Guardians of the Galaxy 2.By far the most moving and memorable thing was the animation of the great grandmother - she was the primary symbol in this story about the continuity of life, told so well through the Mexican tradition of Dia de Muertos. Even before Book of Life, and as a person with no direct cultural links (although I traveled to Mexico with my family a couple times for my dad's business as a child), I have long been a fan of the holiday and wished it was also a part of our own American culture. Even though we tend to remember loved ones around the holidays, it is not a primary focus of Christmas, and I always wish we had a special day just for that. Instead, we tend to avoid thinking about the past in our culture, and avoid cemeteries except for funerals. I love the idea of celebrating the lives of loved ones passed.As we've come to expect from Pixar and family animation in general, there is plenty of campy humor, and there are also abundant references to Mexican culture. I particularly enjoyed that Frida Kahlo was a character, and portrayed with her art. Also true to the genre, and particularly Disney, there were countless memorable characters, especially adorable Miguel, with one dimple. I also appreciated the numerous odd jokes, like the strange spirit animals or the shoes stuck in the ceiling. It made it feel not too perfect, which can make emotional films feel empty. Although I would have liked more music, because this is also a trademark Disney thing, the music that was present, was well placed. Despite being a film about a boy's passion for music, it is not a musical. The music, too, was representative of the culture being portrayed - classical guitar and traditional Mexican singing styles. In fact, after writing this, I plan on adding the sheet music to my Amazon wish list, as watching the guitar scenes inspired me to dig out my guitar.Lastly, I cannot ignore the fact that I found great joy from this film about a culture not my own while in the current political landscape of anti-immigrant sentiment. This month (March), as Dreamers face legal battles and deportation, their native cultures are simultaneously being celebrated in mainstream art, and that troubles me. And even though I have a heavy heart from that fact, I take solace knowing that art is truer, and lasts longer than politics.", "\"Coco\" is a new movie from Disney Pixar Studios and tells the story of a young boy named Miguel who wants to be a musician. He wants to be such a great musician as Ernesto de la Cruz, who in this film is the greatest musician ever. And one day he decides to steal Ernesto's guitar to play with it, but accidentally he goes to the land of the dead and he has to figure out how get out of there. And from there we meet a lot of characters and maybe Ernesto de a Cruz himself.Look, when a new Disney Pixar movie comes along i'm excited. They have accomplished so many things with their animations techniques and bringing also a great story that kids and adults can enjoy, that is virtually impossible to go to a Pixar animated film without great expectations. So i went to this film expecting great things but also with an open mind to seek any flaws with the story or something else.\"Coco\" really surprised me, is a great animated film, and Pixar has prove once again that they are excellent at their job. This movie has, i think, the best animation that i have ever seen in an animated movie. You see the streets, the people, the animals, and it looks real. This movie is very colorful which is also great because it keeps you energized, and you want to see more from this world. The music in this film is terrific, i adore the music of this movie. Another great thing about the film is the characters, this movie has amazing characters. And this movie has great messages about follow your dreams, about how important family is, and their are great thing for kid to appreciate this film.Another thing about the film is that the last 10 minutes, the movie becomes so emotionally powerful that a lot of people cry while watching this film. When you watch the end of the film, it leads to some great satisfying moments and i loved it.The biggest flaw that i have with \"Coco\" is that sometimes the story becomes a little predictable and that is because the story in \"Coco\" is a story that we have seen before in movies, especially in animated films. You see certain things happen and you think: I have seen that before, It reminds me of that other movie. That is a feeling that i had for the majority of the movie, but for the most part, this film is great.In conclusion for this review i would say that \"Coco\" is a story that we have seen before, but is told in a very unique way. Has amazing characters, the animation is great, the music is awesome, and is a great movie for kid to appreciate. I will give \"Coco\" a 8/10.", "No particular reason to love this movie. but the whole thing is awesome.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Pixar rarely put a foot wrong, but lately their animations have become slightly uninspired (I'm looking at you 'Cars' franchise).

Rebelliously he ignores his family's wishes and steals a guitar, to which he suddenly becomes cursed and now resides in the afterlife. This is probably as adventurous a film can be for children in regards to portraying death. Highlighting the importance of remembering loved ones and embracing your family, it's an extremely tender story that rather touched my heart. Trust Pixar to make me emotionally vulnerable. On top of this it's packed full of Mexican culture, in particular the Dia De Los Muertos (\"Day of the Dead\" between you and me) event that is brimming with hearty family values. Miguel, our protagonist, starts off as a stubborn rebel but slowly succumbs to the realisation that others are just as important. Being surrounded by his deceased relatives develops him as a character, to which we emotionally become invested in him and the story itself. A few twists and turns to keep all viewers engaged. Absolutely gorgeous animation, especially the afterlife world which is populated with vibrant spirit animals and colourful architecture. An all Mexican cast is much appreciated and definitely enhances the authenticity of this production, the voice acting and musical numbers were both executed perfectly. \"Remember Me\" was a beautiful song, its lyrics pulled me in. The humour doesn't always hit, and that really is my only flaw. The screenplay just tried too hard.

The movie story is strongly related to music and Pixar studios really made their job researching Mexico's diverse musical genres.Digital textures: I was blown away by the skin textures, grandma Coco's wrinkles were really really realistic, and don't get me started with her clothes, the embroidery... just wow.Visuals: The Land of the Dead was so beautiful as well as the chosen colors.The story: Very heartwarming. It will tug at your heart strings more than once but specially towards the end and even more if you have a loved one who recently departed (Like me).Good exposure to another culture that usually is perceived in a negative light due to mostly stereotypes and people focusing on bad news.What I did not like:Nothing! I absolutely loved everything!'I recommend everyone to watch this movie immediately if you haven't done so.", "Before you start reading or vote unhelpful, let me tell you some things: first of all that I am mexican and second of all that yes, it is a children movie... That deals with death, cheating, murder, treason and kidnapping; so any criticism I make is going to be like of any other movie. The \"this is a movie for children OMG!!1!\" defense is pathetic and you should be ashamed of using it in this movie.Lets start with the title. We found until 20 minutes into the film that Coco is the great grandmother, that has importance until the last 15 minutes. Why calling your movie after an element so unimportant until too god damn late? That would be like calling Se7en 'the box' or Wall-e 'Angry Captain'. Why not \"Miguel's tale\" or \"Music in the heart\" or \"land beyond death\" or some other title?First of all: The animation and the music are really sweet. Both elements are beyond the normal animation. The music is actually chilling, so adequate, extremely beautiful. My only criticism is the dumb dog that is there as a comic relief in an already funny movie, Why does it exist is beyond me. You could have kicked it out and nothing would have been lost.The voice acting is outstanding. I loved it and it actually expresses emotion. They deserve a raise.The plot is solid... although I have a question that is almost nitpicking: Why in the name of everything holy would his great great grandmother doesn't tell him that De La Cruz is not his Great great grandfather from the beggining? You know... What any person in the universe would have done after hearing \"I am going to find my familiar, de La Cruz!\" and knowing he is not your family! I know this would have made the movie an hour shorter, but at least it would not have put your Great great grandson in danger... something anybody would have done. And how did the family made everyone forget about De La Cruz in one measly year? That would be like finding out The beatles stole all of their music and make people forget about them in a year.It is an good movie. I would watch it again.", "Wao...wao... wao...\nwhat i just saw.. what a movie...a movie which Connectify the bondage of a father and a daughter. hats of to the director and screenplay. such a good movie.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "First of all I am going to tell about the animation, gracias Pixar for this great film and awesome animation.

But when he strums the instrument Miguel is spritied to the land of the dead, where he must work with a disgraced skeleton (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) to get back home before he joins the dead.A vibrant and colouful adventure that utilizes elements from the Mexican holiday to weave a touching tale about family, tradition and life after death.

In this movie, we follow a boy who is taught the importance of family and remembering the ancestors while being yourself and fighting for what you love.This movie was all warmth and hearts and had a good deal of funny moments. \nI love when movies shows culture, language and tradition for two reasons. Firstly, because I might learn something new, and secondly, because those in that culture will recognize themselves in the movie. Of course, Disney has done a lot of movies where they show a different culture and traditions, but it might not always feel 100% authentic, but here, from the reviews I've read so far, they really did their research. From the traditions of the ofrenda to the race of the dog that is domestic to Mexico and which Frida was a huge part of keeping alive.

They've been teetering lately with their three most recent films (The Good Dinosaur, Finding Dory and Cars 3) all of which received relatively mixed reviews from a studio who have churned out more timeless animations than any other. Coco sees them back on top form though by emotionally weaving an engaging and constantly surprising story about family, love and loss.It follows a spirited Mexican lad called Miguel who wants nothing more than to be a musician. Unfortunately for him, his family are from a long line of music-haters after Miguel's great great great grandmother's husband left her and her daughter alone in order to pursue a career in music. Since then every child from the family has been raised to detest all kinds of music (as any sane family would do) which means Miguel has to tinkle his ivories in secret whilst worshipping his superstar musical idol, Ernesto De La Cruz. For reasons never quite explained, Miguel ends up in the Mexican land of the dead where a madcap adventure ensues, never failing to entertain along the way.Coco fools you initially by pretending to be a straightforward family adventure film with stunning visuals and cute characters, but a genuinely shocking third act twist reveals itself to be so much more. It's quite barmy how a film targeted for children is more unpredictable than the majority of films aimed at adults in this day and age. Nevertheless, this is Pixar and we all know that despite being family friendly, they're really made for adults!What makes the film so memorable though is its pure emotion. Pixar have been pulling at our heartstrings for years from the infamous opening of Up to the tragic demise of Bing Bong in Inside Out. I'm happy to say that Coco is no exception. I'm not one to cry in films but I must admit to being quite choked up several times in Coco, particularly in its closing moments. This isn't manipulative, sugary, trying-desperately-hard-to-make-you-cry kind of emotion seen in the likes of the recent Wonder but genuine tear duct pulling. This is a film which genuinely cares about its characters so the audience does too.Some people are calling this the best Pixar film ever but I think that's a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. It lacks the innovation of say, Inside Out and the comedy of Up but that's not say it's a great film because it is. Pixar have just churned out such a high calibre of animated features that to say one is better than the other doesn't really count for much. Coco will certainly be beloved for years to come though, I know I'll be watching it with my kids all the time if anyone would have them with me.", "It's a good movie.

HIGHER THE RATING\nIn Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Imelda Rivera was the wife of a musician. Imelda's husband left her and her daughter, Coco, to pursue a career in music. She banned music in the family and opened a shoemaking family business. In the present, her great-great-grandson, Miguel, now lives with the elderly Coco and their family. He secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Imelda's generation. One day, Miguel inadvertently damages the photo of Imelda at the center of the family ofrenda and removes it, discovering that her husband (whose face is torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.Concluding that he is Ernesto's descendant, Miguel leaves to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead despite the objections of his grandmother Elena. He enters Ernesto's mausoleum and steals his guitar to use in the show, but becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can see and be seen by his Xoloitzcuintli dog Dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him there, they realize that Imelda cannot visit as Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Discovering that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, Miguel must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead: to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family using an Aztec marigold petal that can undo the curse placed upon him by stealing Ernesto's guitar. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing but on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits when he returns to the Land of the Living; Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessing.Miguel encounters H\u00e9ctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played with Ernesto and offers to help Miguel reach him. In return, H\u00e9ctor asks Miguel to take his photo back to the Land of the Living so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him and he disappears completely. H\u00e9ctor attempts to return Miguel to his relatives, but Miguel escapes and infiltrates Ernesto's mansion, learning along the way that an old friendship between the two deteriorated before H\u00e9ctor's death. Ernesto welcomes Miguel as his descendant, but H\u00e9ctor confronts them, imploring Miguel to take his photo. Miguel soon realizes that Ernesto poisoned H\u00e9ctor to death and stole the songs he had written, passing them off as his own to become famous. Ernesto steals the photo and has Miguel and H\u00e9ctor thrown into a cenote pit.Miguel realizes that H\u00e9ctor is his actual great-great-grandfather and that Coco is H\u00e9ctor's daughter, the only living person who still remembers him. With the help of Dante - who turns into an alebrije - the dead Riveras find and rescue them. Miguel reveals that H\u00e9ctor's decision to return home to her and Coco resulted in his death, and Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile. They infiltrate Ernesto's sunrise concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo from Ernesto and expose his crimes. Ernesto is crushed by a falling church bell as in his previous life, but the photo falls into the water and disappears.As the sun rises, H\u00e9ctor is in danger of being forgotten and disappearing. Imelda blesses Miguel without conditions so he can return to the Land of the Living, where he plays a song for Coco that H\u00e9ctor wrote for her during her childhood.

Yes, yes I know not quite Bambi in fact the pitch raises the question as to whether Disney was taken over by a morbidly obsessed fan of the latest Mexican hating President but evidently that is not case.Coco is a beautifully crafted story that has to be one of the more original animations from Disney for some time. The premise fresh playing on the traditions of the Mexican nation. The film highlights their diverse culture and celebrations in a glowing light instead of the hate filled rants coming from a certain White House Resident. The film makers have almost purposely taken the film as a climate orientated opportunity to , show the world that not everyone is painted with the same brush.\n \nThe story flows in the rather standard way in the first act but is truly notched up there onwards to propel expectations and style of the modern day animations much like Frozen allowed the twist to freshens it's style.The animators are in no doubt of their audiences which accounts not only for children but the adults accompanying them with a story that in the third act has borrowed a narrative that is almost Shakespearean in it's tragedy and unites the audience with it's common humanity.Knowing full well that the prime audience is children the makers impose good morals and messages in a story that touches, amuses, entertains and surprises you with sweet tenderness.\n \nThe jokes are funny, the songs are catchy and the effects are the standard spot on animations that just seem to fail to age.\n \nI was skeptical of how Disney would pull of a hard sell premise of a kid who spends the film hanging out with dead talking skeletons but hey it works and I can't wait to see what they do next.", "Im so in love with this movie.\ni had tears in my eyes.", "This is definitely up there with Wall-E for me.Coco is one of the saddest pixar films that I have seen.

With the help of Dante, who turns into an alebrije (a brightly coloured mythical creature), the dead Rivera find and rescue them, Miguel reveals that H\u00e9ctor's murder was the result of him wanting to return home to his family, Ernesto killed him for halting their success, Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile.

The story is predictable but done in an extremely engaging matter, balancing the thin line to provide a smart story for both children and adults.

It's a visual, audible and emotional delight, enlivened with loud splashes of color and texture, and accompanied by a constantly upbeat musical vitality. There's no escaping the visual fabric of this film, immersive and jaw-dropping, as it constantly one-ups itself right alongside the developing plot. Particularly stunning is our crossing into the land of the dead, a monumental city of stacked shanties that shimmers and glistens and pulses as its residents decorate and celebrate their annual recognition. The story is simple but effective, perhaps a touch on the predictable side... but so are many animated classics, and sometimes there's something to be said for following through on a promise. Coco wears its heart on its sleeve, with a permeating, spirited warmth that's impossible to ignore, while also touching on tricky, lingering feelings of betrayal and repression. Dazzling and optimistic, with a subject that's, surprisingly, never been explored with such playful reverence in a major family film. Good to see the studio has kept tabs on that bottled magic; for a while, I worried they'd misplaced it.", "This movie is based on beautiful Mexican tradition regarding life after death & family values. It will make you laugh, cry & amaze all at the same time. High points are the animation, story, dialogues, screenplay, songs.. I think it's one of the best animated movies since long.

In fact, I honestly went to see it solely because - with the lazy multiplex habit of milking films like Jedi, Jumanji and (God help us) Pitch Perfect 3 - this was the only film at my local cinemas that I hadn't seen. But wow... just wow!For this is a masterpiece, and with the Oscar nominations released yesterday, it almost seems a crime that it wasn't included in the Best Picture list (it must surely follow its Golden Globes win and snatch the Best Animated film category... although I admit that \"Loving Vincent\" clearly looks like it took a lot more work!).Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) lives in the quaint Mexican village of Santa Cecilia with his extended shoe-making family, including his grandmother Abuelita (Ren\u00e9e Victor) and his wizened old great-grandmother Coco (Ana Ofelia Murgu\u00eda, via a brilliant piece of animation). Coco was a child from a broken home, with music being the cause of all the trouble, and this has led to a multi-generational ban that Abuelita polices with fierce passion. Unfortunately, Miguel \"has the music in him\", idolising the - now deceased - singing sensation and matinee idol Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt, \"Doctor Strange\"). Desperate to perform in the Piazza talent contest, held during the evening of the \"Day of the Dead\" festival, Miguel takes destiny into his own hands.... which might prove fatal as he is dragged, alive and kicking, into the 'land of the dead'.The film is a thing of beauty. Some of the scenes: notably the candlelit graveyard, the \"petal bridge\" and the first sight of the land of the dead are done with such majesty and art that they take your breath away. Literally jaw dropping! (Try to make sure you see it on the big screen). So there are similarities here with \"Blade Runner 2049\" which also had images that could easily grace the walls of any art gallery in the world.Where the film deviates from \"Blade Runner\" though is the original story by Lee Unkrich (who also directs), Adrian Molina (who co-directs), Jason Katz and Matthew Aldrich. Whereas the sci-fi reboot was a bit flaccid, story-wise, Coco develops in a surprisingly non-linear way. The story you think you are on suddenly does unexpected switchbacks and gets very deep indeed.Deep? But this is a kids film right? Well, no, not really. Sure it has a lot of fun skeleton action, in the style of the re-constituting Olaf from \"Frozen\", and a cute but mangy dog with a ridiculously long tongue. But the themes exposed here are FAR from childish. They encompass family, ambition, work/life balance, death and remembrance in such a fashion that parents exposing the film to young kids (I would think, up to 7 or 8 years old) should be ready with sensitive answers to \"Mummy/Daddy, why...\" questions so as to avoid significant anxiety and nightmares. The relationship between Miguel and his grandmother Abuelita, switching from violent outbursts to sudden loving hugs, might - I think - also confuse and disturb young children. Its UK certificate is \"PG\", not \"U\", for good reason.So be prepared to cry. If you are anything like me, there will be a point in this film where you are desperately trying to recall the faces and voices of all of those people in your life that you have lost over the years. And some of the final jolts in this film will leave you almost as drained (almost!) as the start of \"Up\".As befits the subject matter there is a great score, with a mariachi feel, by Michael Giacchino, including a nice rendition of \"When You Wish Upon A Star\" over the Disney castle production logo. And there are some great songs, including the pivotal \"Remember Me\" which is now Oscar nominated.Watch out for some nice cameo voice performances as well: Cheech Marin (from Cheech and Chong) plays the 'border control' officer, and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger (Hamm in \"Toy Story\") turns up again playing Juan Ortodoncia, a character whose dentist fondly remembers him (LOL)!With John Lasseter recently dragged into the #metoo scandal, and taking 6 months off to ponder on his \"missteps\", one hopes this will not knock Pixar off its track too much. For with this evidence the studio shouldn't keep trying to milk existing \"Incredibles\" and \"Toy Story\" franchises, but come up with more original entertainments like this. Because, for me, this rises into my top-three favourite Pixar films of all time (along with Toy Story and Wall-E).(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the full graphical version of the review.

It doesn't achieve the completeness of other monumental titles like 'The Incredibles' or 'Toy Story 3', nor does it match the inspired cleverness of 'Inside Out'. It is, however, an appealing, colourful and emotionally tender film with unique visuals, enjoyable musical numbers and splendid animation.The respect for authenticity in the representation of Mexican tradition is to be applauded, with the designs of the dead ancestors all built around the graphic skulls that are used to celebrated Dios de los Muertos. Every shot is beautifully crafted, a profusion of glowing candles, marigolds and vibrant festival colour.The film is ultimately about the importance of family, community and honouring your shared history. It's a celebration of culture. I found this was laid on a bit thick at times, with characters often explaining too much of what they do with regards to festival preparations etc, which kind of makes it feel like a lesson. I felt the expository stuff was aimed more toward younger children than a more knowing audience who didn't need to be spoon fed, but anyway it's a small criticism. The emotional moments are not as deftly handled as Carl and Ellie's heartbreaking love-story in Up, they felt a bit syrupy and hammed up in parts, but they still manage to pluck the heartstrings and the ending is well earned, a few plot contrivances aside.Overall the story is well told, with loveable characters, in particular Dante, Miguel's brain-dead dog, who has some of the funniest animation I've seen in a long time, every scene he was in had me in stitches. I also loved the sequence with Frida Kahlo and her avant garde art installation. There's at least enough humour to keep adults entertained, even if most of the film feels aimed more at the under 10's.Coco is good, wholesome fun!", "Pixar have always aimed for a kind of emotional maturity not often seen in family fare and 'Coco (2018)' is no exception, with the only 'kiddy caveats' being its initial abundance of extremely on-the-nose and unnecessarily front-loaded exposition, with some genuine emotional resonance rising from the fairly typical 'finding your family' and 'lost loved-ones' themes that are here elevated through their brilliant execution. You empathise entirely with the musical Miguel at almost every moment, from finding the obtuse stubbornness of his family incredibly frustrating to coming to terms with the sacrifices he must make in order to stay with them, and even the various twists and turns are pretty original (also quite risky) even if I did cotton onto them far before they were actually revealed. It's really enjoyable and, in typical Pixar fashion but maybe more so than before, it might even provoke a tear or two. 7/100 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This is one's of Pixar's all time best.

The instant I saw the trailer of this film, I knew it will be the best for 2017's animated films. And seeing a film after a very long wait proved that I was right.Plot: Migues, an aspiring musician, reaches the Land of the Dead by accidently playing the deceased Ernesto de la Cruz's guitar.Story and direction: Pixar for me is the animation company that not only provided some great characters and films, but also with each film gives something that latches on to you for the rest of your life. That in Coco is the theme. Its the importance of family that takes prime importance in the story. This theme is so well crafted in the story. Then the animation. I was mesmerized by the kind of animation this film had especially the designs for the land of the dead. It felt like I was travelling through that place. It felt very live-like. I might be wrong about this fact but I have never seen Spanish culture so very correctly depicted in any film. It respected the culture and showed the culture in its various colors. The songs and background score by Micheal Giacchino were awesome. It further enriched the Spanish culture. But this film had a tiny little fault. I felt that in some places the film took a route that was seen before in many films.Favorite Scene: it would be the scene where Miguel tries to play the guitar while seeing a music video of Ernesto de la Cruz on TV. The passion and love that Miguel has for music is clearly visible in this particular scene.Verdict: Pixar again proves why it is the best when it comes to animated films. This film will be remembered for a long time in the minds of people. Watch this film certainly, it has a lot of entertaining and emotional value that will be woven into your hearts forever.I am going with a 9/10.", "After watching the trailers for Coco, I wasn't sold. I didn't laugh at any of the jokes, nor did I find any of the characters endearing enough to justify dedicating almost two hours of my life to. Regardless, I saw it anyway; I've been attempting to see films I thought I won't enjoy recently, but yet again, I've been surprised.I will quickly say that I don't think Coco is a masterpiece. I'm not entirely convinced it's even 'great'. I still enjoyed it, however, and that's good enough for me.The main talking point for the film seems to be the visuals, and for the most part, I can understand why. It's certainly a very pretty film. You can see how much time and care went into each frame, and I can't even comprehend being one of the animators on a project like this. With this said, however, I don't feel I witnessed anything revolutionary in terms of animation. While my memory might be wrong, I believe this film to be on a similar level to Moana. That's definitely not a negative; Moana's probably my favourite animated film in recent memory, primarily due to it's animation.The brilliant visuals do bring a flaw, however. With all of the wondrous colours assaulting your vision, it comes full circle, and ceases to be impressive after a while. There is simply too much colour for me to enjoy the film as a whole. I'll use a scene from Rogue One as an example. Regardless of your thoughts on the film, one of the final scenes featuring a certain Sith Lord was generally considered to be brilliant, at least amongst fans. The absence of colour, followed by the jarringly bright crimson adds to the scene, and doesn't simply exist to be pretty to look at. Sometimes, less is more.The soundtrack was rather mixed, too. Parts were very fitting, and added to the scene. Other parts, however, sounded like generic Disney filler that could have been pasted into any other film and work just as well.Since the film features music, primarily guitars, rather prominently, I also found myself confused at moments; I heard somebody playing the guitar, but the character actually holding it wasn't doing anything. It took me a few moments to realise it was actually the scoring.Additionally, while this movie is obviously aimed for the family, I found many of the plot-points rather obvious. It intentionally makes it's plot unnecessarily complicated in an attempt to fool you, but if you understand basic storytelling tropes, you'll pick up on the plot rather promptly, even if the film changes specific elements just to surprise a few people. The film feels as though it's trying to be surprising, and sad, and funny, rather than letting it's scenes speak for themselves. Much of it feels forced, at least to me.Many of the characters also weren't particularly likeable. The main character, Miguel, comes across as a legitimately bad person many times in this film, and everyone else doesn't fare much better. Obviously, the villain is cruel, but also those who we're supposed to like are selfish and unpleasant. I thought that at the end perhaps they'd apologise and acknowledge their wrongdoings, but it never happens. Only Miguel has to change himself in this film, and he still gets everything he wants in the end anyway.Overall, this film actually struggles to excel in specific areas. It's very serviceable, with bits dipping below average, and others rising above. Thankfully, the pros manage to outweigh the cons, making Coco an enjoyable film, regardless of how simple it's message is. I'll give it a shaky 7/10, though if you enjoy all other Disney films, or the general aesthetic of the movie, you'll most likely love this one.", "Pixar return in a death defying new magical tale: CocoEntering the wonderful Mexican culture of D\u00eda de Muertos or Day of the Dead. Director: Lee Unkrich, the outstanding creator of Toy Story 3 (2010), packs the same emotional punch through the magnificent Spanish tradition in a beautiful and heart melting story.Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez) aspires to be a musician in his home Santa Cecilia, Mexico, but as part of his family history, song and music have been condemned forever. Unable to fight his dream, during the Day of the dead, Miguel finds himself in reach of his idol: Ernesto de la Cruz's (Benjamin Bratt), guitar which transports him into the land of the dead, becoming visible to his remembered ancestors. To help Miguel figure out how he can make it back to land of the living is the 'unforgettable' Hector (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) a rickety skeleton trying to reach the land of the living but is fading from the memories of his own family.As always baffles me is Pixar's astonishing talent in compacting the laughs, the story, and tears in exquisite animation pictures. The animation's studio's 19th film shows that they've never lost the magic. In unique territory then before, but still bringing all you'd expect, Coco will be regarded as another animated classic. Although Coco hasn't revolutionized the customary storytelling, Coco still becomes a wonderful and beautiful work, doing that Pixar thing in a new and interesting form.At its core is the virtuous chronicle about remembering, and family, a touching look into heritage,and identity. An emotional driving force of memory really brings out the tears in the expected heart-wrenching moments. Even more successful is the film honourable achievement of taking this rather delicate subject matter and producing it in a playful and joyful fashion. Pixar execute this tremendously surrounded by the ravishing and colourful imagery of the land of the dead, as well as the laugh out loud jokes (one at the beginning, which if you have any extended European family, will find hilarious.) As always with Pixar humor is the slapstick, against the hilarity of the funny yet poignant laughs part of the film's universal appeal.Similar, to a previous 2017 animated feature, (The LEGO Batman Movie), Coco does become a very energetic film, in early rushes and excitement to get going with the plot. This is only minor nit-pic, but just moments I wanted it to just take its time, which is better than wanting the film to hurry up.\nMore distant from its regular works, Coco still keeps in tact with its own ancestors, like Ratatouille (2007) (embracing the delicious French culture) investing in the wonderful Spanish society, or Monsters Inc. (2001) (bringing to life and civilizing, the whimsical world of monsters) beautifully visualising and fabricating the land of the dead. Furthermore bringing that home grown family love that all Pixar works provide. Of course there is significant resemblance to the 2014 animated adventure The Book of Life, which if you enjoyed then I 'm sure your love Coco . The film also echoes moments from 2016's stop motion picture Kubo and the Two Strings, with similar emotional background.Pixar's latest masterwork is an exceptional tribute to family and ancestry, in a new but also traditional form. For those who find themselves at this point in a mournful state, I truly believe Coco will be an uplifting and celebratory watch in remembrance of the ones we loose, but never forget. A fantastically moving creation by the brilliant animated magicians, Pixar yet again create an exceptional piece of cinema, to be relished by all.", "Coco. Wow. To say that Pixar has one again made a compelling story with great morals and beautiful visuals is to say that the water is wet, but that doesn't take away the grand gesture this movie pulls off.Coco is, ultimately, a story about music, family and respecting the dead and how these themes intertwine each other is glorious. I think what I loved most about this film and about most all Pixar films is the world building and characters. From the moment you are lunged into the opening, in Disney fashion they open the doors to this great Mexican world where you are left to discover not only the land of the dead but the secrets of a family who hates music. Which by the way, the Soundtrack in Coco is phenomenal and really knows how to pull your heart strings as you may expect. Everything in Coco happens for a reason and yet, for someone who has seen quite a lot of film the twists and turns in the movie surprised me. It keeps you on your feet anticipating where the journey is going to take you and it's these sort of movies which reminds me why I love DIsney, it's these movies which make me forget about the outside and bring me into an experience.You could argue the moral of the movie is a little cliche of loving family and sticking with your passion but its done so refreshingly that it doesn't even matter. I'd say the only fault of this movie is that its very familiar to Pixar movies but it's hardly on my mind. I really hope this becomes the next frozen because it deserves it. It has loveable characters, a loveable world and a compelling journey with great morals and outstanding soundtrack and animation. What more could you ask for on a family night out?Coco is worth seeing no matter what your age and I really hope it lives on as a Pixar classic. 9/10", "This is the best animation I watched so far, me and my daughter have been watching movies for 3 years without missing any release but this one is clearly too good to match with others.Story, emotions, creative designs, musics all are excellent, masterpiece.Too bad my 5 years old daughter could not get story as much as me and my wife did but she enjoyed anyways.This movie is not just for kids, I can say that, to watch this you do not have a kid with you etc.I read comments during break about \"crying etc\" and find myself crying at the end with my wife.", "Everything about this movie make know, remember every nice memories and forget every bad memories.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This review of Coco is spoiler free**** (4/5)DIRECTOR PETE DOCTER'S Oscar winning Inside Out wasn't just a film about four colourful characters with very different emotions. It was also one of the best looking animated features in recent years, with that and a heart-wrenching message at the end it was one of the films that firmly secures it among the Pixar greats with Toy Story (all of them), Up and WALL-E - and to be fair it deserves to be up there. \n \nTheir latest, Coco happily joins that list from a creativity point of view. The film takes place in Mexico taking a broad focus on the country's art, music, history and the customs including the annual Day of the Dead festival. We open with 12-year-old Miguel (Gonzalez) an aspiring musician who dreams of being famous like his idol Ernesto De La Cruz (Bratt) however his family's ancestral ban stops him from pursuing the dream. With his persistence and guitar in hand he's transported to the Land of the Dead. A musical underground town that's filled with high-rises beautifully lit streets, skeletons and spirit animals and thanks to the bright colour palette and stunning animation the film looks dazzling as Miguel travels through the town. \n \nTypically like other Pixar top-formers it doesn't come without their storytelling grandeur, like with Up and WALL-E it comes with love and with Inside Out it hits all the points of emotion - this one is profound in cleanly cut messages; family, love, life and death (yes there's even death in the afterlife). However the toughest truth that the film comes with is the true power of forgetting (a disappearing skeleton is a sensational standout). And director Lee Unkrich's (Toy Story 3) approach to each will leave a soulful tear running down your cheek - and let's be honest we wouldn't blame you.\n \nYou have to credit Pixar for taking a beautiful look at another culture, yet full praise goes to the entirely Mexican-American voice cast from Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal who plays Miguel's crafty skeletal guide, via Bratt as his idol and Alanna Ubach as his vicious Mam\u00e1 Imelda etc. Still the best performance goes to Gonzalez as Miguel he shows pure confidence even with the film's blissful musical numbers. And it's here when Coco shows off its highest note, the music is fun, it's cheerful and giddy, yet like Disney's other musical gems the notes often hit right at home and this one is definitely no exception to that. \n \nTheir 19th film is indeed a flourishing return to form for Pixar, however it's not perfect as the story often covers similar ground with 2014s The Book of Life and sadly falls out of tune with that sudden drop. Still with that said Coco is a beautiful, colourful and emotional look into Mexico's artful culture, one that will leave a warm feeling deep in your heart and will have you dancing even after the credits stop. \n \nVERDICT The latest offering from Pixar is a true artscape of colourful animation and raw emotional storytelling if the afterlife is this exciting then death truthfully shouldn't be anything to fear.", "Worthy of all the awards it can get. Pixar masterpiece indeed.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Knowing me, I am a huge Pixar fan, I love most of their films, they have originality, clever writing, beautiful animation and characters that we can all relate to, I know Pixar may be overrated but they still do great stuff... well most great stuff, not every one of their films are great, despite I like the first and third Cars they are not the best from Pixar, Monsters University was okay, Brave was nothing special, the Good Dinosaur was really underrated and Cars 2 is okay despite being the worst Pixar film.But with all that said after Cars 3, there was going to be another Pixar film by the name of Coco, which from what I can tell from the teaser, It looked almost like the Book of Life, same concept, same style of animation and seems to have the same plot, while it did look good and funny, I wasn't too sure if It would work as a original film since everyone has said It's similar to the Book of Life, now the Book of Life Is Fantastic, It has great animation, good comedy and lots of great music, along with some great voice acting, but after seeing Coco on a early release (on the 13th and 14th of January however i saw It on he 13th) but It's actually released today January 19th here In the UK, but I just saw It earlier anyway, I saw the film and holy crap Pixar has still got it!, I loved every minute of the movie, In fact It's so wonderful I stood up and clapped by the end of the movie because of how delightful and colourful It Is!.The plot may not be anything special but how Pixar executed It was excellent!, It takes you on a incredible journey and It moves the plot a lot unlike most animated films nowadays where It drags on and on like not Coco, Coco does It In a unique and clever way that It has a couple of twists I did not see coming which made the movie so refreshing to bring some twists and secrets that are surprisingly and really touching, the film of course like all of Pixar's films are genuinely funny, while also having a couple of clever jokes as well, but what most Pixar films have that will change your mood is emotion, holy crap this movie is very sad, there are moments you will cry to they are that powerful, also the world of Land of the Dead in how it works is quite interesting, like if you don't get remembered by anyone by memory or picture, you'll die being forgotten which is interesting and really touching too, so yeah the plot has originality, humour, heart, lots of clever material and the film's main theme of family brings the humanity and relatable elements to a whole new level and works well in the plot, make this one of the Pixar's best writing.The animation is well... what can you say about Pixar's animation, they always put effort in their animation and this animation doesn't disappoint, It's looks breathtaking, really colourful which made me happy since I love colourful animation and the human characters have this cartoony but down-to-earth style to it that makes them look real, the skeletons are more comedic but their designs are great and really creative with their body parts from arms to legs, even the head, the textures are fantastic make It almost look like a live-action Film, from the texture of the Miguel's hometown, to Dante's fur, to the character's looks and the Land of Dead looking like a real place for celebration, Pixar has really out done themselves with the animation and I'm happy to say It's one of the best looking animated films of all time.The characters are Likeable, relatable, funny and well developed, My favourite is H\u00e9ctor, he's now one of my favourite Supporting characters from Pixar along with Cruz (Cars 3), Hank (Finding Dory), Anger (Inside Out), Dug (Up), Dory (Finding Nemo) and Edna Mode (the Incredibles), he's funny, relatable and has a touching backstory which I will not spoil but it is really touching, Miguel Is also a great main character, heck he's not kid character I didn't find annoying, I found him endearing, funny, likeable and actually kind of cute, Dante is a funny character too, despite he fact he doesn't do much but physical comedy, but he is funny and does play a supporting part in the film, Ernesto De La Cruz plays a key part in this movie, he's the reason Miguel went to the land of the dead, he does come off as musician that has a lot of passion but without spoilers, he's role later on may come off as obvious but it's still a really good twist, the other characters like Miguel's relatives like his Mum, Dad, Mama Coco, his grandmother and his relatives from the Land of the Dead all have personalties and a part to shine to help Miguel on his journey and his decision of wanting to do something he loves or do what the family is doing, these characters don't come off as a generic or annoying, they have part to play, they are all funny, unforgettable relatable and have strong emotion and that's what make them really strong.Oh and one more thing, the music is wonderful, not just Michael Giacchino's score which is also amazing but the songs like Remember Me, Un Loco Coco and The World Es Mi Familia are all wonderful and they all have a meaning behind each and every one of them, which makes them stand out, also keep in mind Coco is not a musical, It just have songs that have a purpose, but none the less the music is fantastic.So that's Coco, honestly I don't know what else to say, I have no issues with the films, It's that perfect, the plot's original, the concept is very interesting, the animation is one of the Pixar's best, the characters represent who we are today making them unforgettable and the music is phenomenal, I know people has already seen it since it came out before us but for those who are going to see It today, go see It, you'll love it to bits and the children will have fun with it as well, this movie will also have a moral about which kids will hopefully get by the end of the movie and learn from it.I know It's cliches but this Is one of Pixar's best films In recent along with Inside Out, Finding Nemo/Dory, Wall-E and Ratatouille, so go see It when you can.I'm happy to give Coco a 10/10.", "Coco is another fantastic addition to Pixar's film library, and what a library they've already established; they've tackled sentient toys, bugs, monsters in closets, cars, Parisian rats who can cook, superheroes, robots in the future, fish, a house flying by balloons, even dinosaurs, and now Pixar has taken on the extremely challenging topic of 'The Afterlife', specifically through a story revolving around 'The Day of the Dead' in Mexico. And it's fantastic: a seemingly simple story on the surface turns into a subversively great and thought-provoking masterpiece that makes up for one of the most beautiful animated films in recent memory.Coco was directed by Lee Unkrich, the Pixar-vet who helmed Toy Story 3 in 2010, and boy this guy has shown that he's just as capable as Brad Bird, Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton; Unkrich is a man who's taken animation to new places like the rest of his Pixar-compadres have before, and Pixar is still delivering innovative movies left-right-and-center (with the exception of the Cars movies). I love Coco; it's a culturally gorgeous capsule that explores family, music, life and memory in exquisite detail. I'm speechless for how well realised this movie was. Yes the beats that lead us into the world seem pretty familiar, but by the time you're in the 'Land of the Dead' the terrain becomes more emotionally unpredictable and you're on a journey that speaks to audiences: young and old.Coco is what computer-animation needed to have; a culturally specific story that speaks volumes about the universal relationship people have with music and family, making this one of the best 'me-too' kinds of stories to be told in the cinema. See it, and be amazed.", "If I could use one word to describe this movie, it would be artistic. The movie looks amazing and vibrant, and it perfectly captures the culture of mexico and the meaning behind dias de los muertos. The characters are likable and realistic, and the buildup to the end of the movie is masterful. All of the songs, even the obvious Oscar contender, are great. The only gripe I have with this movie is that the middle dragged on a little too long. It's not my favorite Pixar movie ONLY because of personal preference. Go watch this movie, and ignore the Frozen short.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "TL;DROne of Pixar's absolute bestOriginal, relatable and adorable storyBeautifully animated with stunning visualsGenuine Mexican representation and a love-letter to its countryCatchy tunes that will tug at your heartstrings------------------------------------------It seems strange, but I remember a simpler time when Pixar only had a few films under their belt; Toy Story (1 and 2), A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc. ... They quickly became famous for delivering outstanding films with excellent animation and a heart that appeal to adults as much as their intended audience, children. Now, releasing their 19th film, Coco, Pixar have built up such a strong reputation that their films can't fail to bring with them not only hype and excitement, but astronomically high expectations. Occasionally they trip up (the Cars series comes to mind...) but they've never made an outright bad film yet. So is Coco the one to stop their perfect run? Absolutely not - if anything, Coco shoots right up to the top Pixar films of all time, happily nestled among the best films (animated and otherwise) of all time.As they've proved time and time again, Pixar can give one hell of an amazing, original story. Whether it's toys trying to return home, a fish finding his son or ants fighting for freedom, Pixar always manage to find a story that everyone can relate to in some way; a story where someone is searching for something important to them. Coco, yet again, gives us a relatable and universal story about music, family and self-discovery. More than this though, they deliver an original, creative story that's as entertaining as it is moving. Sweet and touching as we've come to expect, this film particularly focuses on the importance of family, acceptance and love embedded in an exciting story which never gets stale.Of course it's impossible for it to get stale and for us to feel bored because the film's just too beautiful. Though now at the point where we rarely even acknowledge it, there are instances where we can see how advanced CGI has become. Coco is a perfect example of what can be done today, with stunning visuals and incredible attention to detail. It is one of the most gorgeously animated Pixar films, with as much detail and thought going into the 'real world' as there is in the eternally colourful Land of the Dead. The film absolutely sucks you in with a vivid world saturated with exquisite colour and designs.Indeed, these would be nothing without the culture of its subject in the first place - Mexico, itself an extraordinarily colourful place. Pixar seem to have in a way dedicated this film as a love-letter to Mexico, its people and its culture. This is far from cultural appropriation some may have feared; instead everything here is utterly Mexican, somehow managing to disguise occasionally exposition-heavy dialogue and make learning fun. Even the language, though predominantly English, still includes many Spanish words, from the basics like 'gracias' to more specific words like 'ofrenda.' There aren't any token references to culture; instead Pixar have absolute commitment to the culture, something which is absolutely commendable. This extends even to the cast, all being ethnically appropriate with only the small exception of John Ratzenberger, Pixar's 'good-luck charm' who's in nearly every Pixar film somewhere.One aspect not often celebrated in Pixar films is music. While Disney films are often animated musicals, Pixar films are usually just animated films, music confined just to the soundtrack. Instead, Coco places music front and centre along with family as its focus. Beside the gorgeously composed score from Michael Giacchino is music from the very talented Robert Lopez (one of the geniuses behind The Book of Mormon, a show packed with wonderful songs) and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the couple who notably created those catchy and unforgettable songs from Frozen. Whilst there may be no 'Let It Go' in Coco (a relief to parents worldwide), 'Un Poco Loco' and, more than this, 'Remember Me,' are wonderful songs that will stay in your head and be sung as favourites for years to come. 'Remember Me' especially is the one song guilty to make you weep in your seat towards the end (make sure you watch this in 3-D - you need the glasses to hide those tears!)It might seem like a daring move to make a 'children's' film about death - but, yet again, Pixar prove they can make a film about anything and still find a way to make it outstanding. With an original, sweet story, gorgeous visuals, wonderful music and genuine Mexican representation (a real middle finger up to Trump), Coco is a beautiful, magical film that can't fail to delight audiences worldwide - an absolute masterpiece. Bring some tissues, but get ready for one of your new favourite films.", "Pixar does it again with another original masterpiece they can add to their collection. With beautiful landscapes, a great dark story that stays touching to the heart, and lovable characters all around this movie doesn't disappoint. It's amazing to see the spirit animals and the backgrounds not to mention the amount of emotion on every dead person has. Capturing such emotion out of a skull in 3-D I can imagine was difficult to say the least. If anything bothered me I thought Dante was a little annoying and the story had a speed bump or too but that is very knit-picky to a movie that deserves the praise it has received. Hopefully we can get more Pixar originals in the future (not so many sequels).0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This movie is soo good, at first when i saw this it's remind me the book of life movie but with diferent story.

Tear jerker.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Pixar is widely regarded as one of, if not the, best animation studios in the world. With an extensive list of beloved films, and only a few that are considered subpar, they really do hold the highest standards in the industry. With that in mind, Coco is more than a worthy addition to the Pixar family. It takes place in Mexico and follows a child named Miguel, who dreams of being a musician despite his family's hatred thereof. On D\u00eda de los Muertos, he ventures into the Land of the Dead to seek his idol Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician he admires. Meanwhile, his ancestors try to return him to the Land of the Living, as he will die if he stays there too long. The story is very interesting, and keeps your attention quite well. The only real downside here is that if you've watched most of the recent Disney movies, some of the twists at the end will be rather predictable. Still, that's not enough to really detract from how good the movie actually is. As you can imagine, the music plays a major part in the story. \"Remember Me\" is one of the best Disney songs lately, and possibly one of Pixar's best tear-jerkers. Given that Pixar is known for that, that's no small feat. \"Un Poco Loco\" was very good as well. As with most Pixar movies, the characters are lovable, memorable, and well written. The characters, like real families, clearly love each other and wish the best for each other, despite the conflicts they have. That realism with the characters is one of the movie's strengths. Because of that, most of the story doesn't have a proper villain, because Miguel's family - living and dead, care for him dearly. The animation is some of the best ever made, which is to be expected coming from Pixar. The Land of the Dead looks spectacular and imaginative, and the color scheme is beautiful. The imagery that appears in D\u00eda de los Muertos celebrations in Mexico is shown here, and the way its reflected in the character designs for the dead is fantastic. The accuracy that goes into characters playing guitar is also outstanding. This is easily one of Pixar's best movies. And that's really saying something.It is also worth noting that Olaf's Frozen Adventure, the short before the movie, was way out of place. It wouldn't be bad as a TV special, but it's not the type of thing you want be stuck sitting through prior to the movie. Still, that doesn't detract from Coco itself.", "'Coco' is colorful and vibrant, blending a number of unique personalities and vivid landscapes. Coco' shows us what Disney-Pixar does best, and reminds us that it still hasn't lost its touch. Take your kids along for it, and if you don't have any, don't hesitate to go alone! Going beyond the usual 'follow your dreams' mantra, 'Coco' has multiple messages to take home. It's also a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being a celebrity, and more importantly an ode to family, especially the ones who aren't with us anymore", "A cartoon for every home and age. love the names, the characters and so much more.\nGreat cartoon thanks Disney and Pixar for the remarkable work0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This is an animated film from Pixar, which features a very dark plot.

Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3) and Adrian Molina who direct this film obviously care about the material.

That run seemed to come to an end when they made Cars 2 and they have been pumping out some pretty average movies ever since.What made Pixar great was the marriage of stellar animation, peerless storytelling and emotional manipulation. Up still gets me every time. What was missing was originality and emotion because, let's face it, everyone else has caught up animation wise. Coco sees Pixar back in form if not on top form.The animation is gorgeous (as you would expect) but it is the emotional connection of the family that makes it work (Pixar is back!) and the songs are truly super (Disney showing their input). It bears an uncanny resemblance to The Book of Life (2014) - which is also a great movie - but Coco does the whole voyage and return with real verve and the journey carries you along without any pause to draw breath and my daughter was in tears many time and even I got a little grit in my eye now and again.Great to see Pixar back in the zone and I hope that they can push on and get back to their best.", "Family-themed movies never fails to play my emotion and Pixar did it perfectly.

I can count on one hand the number of animated films that I truly enjoy. However, there's something about Pixar, where they do have the best quality animated features. I really liked Inside Out (which surprised the hell out of me) and do like the Toy Story trilogy. I didn't think a whole lot of Coco from the trailers I saw but had to give it a fair chance. I really liked this film, it was entertaining, creative, emotional, and wonderful to look at.The film is about a young boy named Miguel who lives with his family in a household that is strictly against any form of music. This stems from his great grandmother being abandoned by her father who was a musician. One day on D\u00eda de Muertos, Miguel attempts to borrow the guitar of a famous deceased musician and finds himself transported (and stuck in) the realm of the dead. The only way to get back is to get a blessing from a family member before sunrise. Along the way, Miguel tries to find out who is musician ancestor is.I enjoyed this film the whole way through. Once again the content of the film was creative and had a lot of heart as is regularly the case with a Pixar film. I think the film does a great job of portraying an interesting look into Mexican culture, through the depiction of the Day of the Dead, the music, and the family values. The film carries the same amount of depth as something like Inside Out. It also carries a similar amount of fun, silliness and charm. i was pleasantly surprised with how much of it I was enjoying. Parts of the film do drag, sure, but its carried by enough strong moments.The voice acting is great, and visually the film is quite stunning. Its rich and eye popping color give it such a vibrant and alluring feel. The music and score is good. It'll be enjoyable for all ages.

I'm sure, for many of us, who although are ardent fans of Disney-Pixar collaborations (Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Up, Inside Out, etc), may have missed out on Coco which released in Nov '17. And it shows in their global collections (< $600m).But as I watched the movie unfold it's colourful music and magic on my TV screen, I immediately started to regret, missing watching it on the theatre. A delectable comedy drama based in Mexico (creators indulging in meticulous research on the cultural aspects, depicting them with warmth); the story follows Miguel, a cute round eyed 12 year old who has immense love for music.For this review, I mean to state some of issues upfront. The plot start on a familiar note - the boy wants to follow a path, which his family hates - remember Ratatouille?, the family is caricature, most of the scenes are predictable (more Disney here than Pixar) and it definitely includes fantasy - a transition to another world which changes the protagonist into a better person (yes, as in almost all Disney movies).If so, why did I regret not watching it? Although the storyline is straightforward, it has alot of warmth (yes, I'll repeat this word); a fuzzy family feel to it which connects you and almost brings you to tears at the end of it. The impeccable research on Mexican culture and the depiction of D\u00eda de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), in a sensible and touching manner leaves the audience with sweet memories while stressing on the importance of remembering and cherishing the dead. If you'd note, every culture across the world (especially the old ones) always had dedicated days to celebrate the dead, atleast 1 generation above.We all have heard our parents and grandparents fondly remembering their childhood and may have ignored them or even criticized them (inside our heads) for droning on about the same memories. The movie, by communicating in a nice way states that those whom you remember from your past, never really die. They remain alive in another world. As this generation of ours grows older and we witness passing away of our grandparents, this is an important message to remember. And more to spend atleast one day in a year talking about them and sharing a laugh and a tear.By using the smallest of elements including the golden petals of the Aztec marigold flower as a travel portal, highlighting the importance of family's blessings and showing how, unspoken words of love, can harm an entire generation, the movie retains all the best things an animation can bring, while being so much relatable to every culture in the world.And then of course is the music. Composed by Michael Giacchino (the guy who had us swooning in 'Up'), it's instantly hummable and also capable of singing along once you listen to it. Justapoxed with Spanish and English lyrics, the 'Un poco loco', Miguel's stage debut song is my favourite. And few of them do make you want to get up and groove as well. Most people would also love 'Remember me' not just for it's music, but also it's lyrics.Special mention to Gael Garcia Bernal, the voice actor for 'Hector', for brilliantly voicing comedy, love and tragedy all.so convincingly.'Coco' is a recommended watch as per me. And be ready when you eventually realise whom the movie is named on.

Hints are cleverly dropped along Miguel's journey to discover his history. Some are easy to miss, and some obvious ones aren't what we first think they are. In the end the movie rewards us with not just thrilling revelations, but also delight at how skillfully they've been woven together. A villain is defeated, but the day isn't won by beating the bad guy. The true victory comes in a moment of music that's a pure expression of love stretching across generations.Coco is fresh enough that it doesn't feel like a rehash of films we've all seen before. Part of the credit goes to the authentic celebration of Mexican music and culture. The film is like a great new song from your favorite band: original and familiar at the same time. While it may or may not be a chart topper, Coco deserves a place among Pixar's greatest hits.", "Stop Lowering The Rating and Start Highering it!The Rivera family history is told, explaining that its matriarch Imelda was the wife of a musician who left her and her child Coco to pursue a career in music. She turned to shoemaking which became the family business, and began a tradition which to this day bans music in the Riveras. Her great-great-grandson, 12-year-old Miguel, lives with his elderly great-grandmother Coco and the rest of her descendants in the small, fictional Mexican village of Santa Cecilia. He secretly dreams of becoming a musician like his idol, the late Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular singer and film star who died in a performance when a stage worker accidently drops a giant bell on him. Miguel keeps a secret hideout with many memorabilia from de la Cruz and he is everyday discouraged by his family about becoming a musician. When Miguel tries to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead, his Abuelita destroys his guitar when he tried to convince her to see him play. Miguel then discovers something hidden in the photo of Imelda - taken with her husband and an infant Coco - at the center of the family ofrenda: her husband (whose face is ripped out) was holding the guitar famously used by Ernesto.Concluding that he is Ernesto's great-great-grandson, Miguel is emboldened to steal the musician's guitar from his mausoleum to use in the show, but in doing so, he played a magic chord and finds that he is no longer visible or tangible to living people (only to Dante, a street dog he has befriended). Instead he can see his skeletal dead relatives, who are visiting the Land of the Living on this holiday, and they can see him. They believe this is related to Imelda's inability to cross the bridge to the world of the living, and take Miguel to Land of the Dead to solve the puzzle.They learn that Imelda cannot cross because Miguel removed her portrait from the ofrenda. Furthermore, Miguel has to be restored to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead. The curse from the Riveras which sent him to this plane of existence can be undone by the blessing of a family member such as Imelda; she gave Miguel her blessing with the condition of abandon his musical ambitions. Just as he received the blessing, Miguel disobeyed the condition and was sent back with Imelda which now forces him to accept her conditions but Miguel refuses and escapes to search for Ernesto, figuring he can get a blessing from that ancestor with no such conditions.Miguel encounters H\u00e9ctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who says he once played with Ernesto and died eating a chorizo (Mexican styled sausage), and offers to take Miguel to him, in exchange for a favor of putting his picture on an ofrenda so he can cross the flower bridge to see his daughter which he agrees. To make the plan work, Hector paints Miguel's face to disguise as a skeleton and goes for a guitar from his friend Chicharr\u00f3n who is fading because he has no remaining living relatives to remember him. Chicharr\u00f3n disappears from the Land of the Dead soon after, as Miguel realizes H\u00e9ctor is in danger of being forgotten by the living, and he wants Miguel to take his photo back to his world so H\u00e9ctor can use it to visit his daughter one last time before she forgets him.Imelda and the dead Riveras are determined to find Miguel so she sends her winged jaguar alebrije Pepita to find him. Miguel and Hector managed to meet Frida Kahlo, whom she tell them they can get to meet Ernesto if they win a talent show to be his opening act. At first Miguel was nervous but he managed to win the contest, but then Pepita and the Riveras find him and he has to escape, as well that Hector is now angry that Miguel lied to him that Ernesto was his only relative and he could have put his photo earlier. Just as Miguel was cornered by Imelda and Pepita, he argues that he won't accept her blessing if she won't let him do something he loves deeply and she wouldn't understand how being a musician is, but she proves him wrong with singing a rachero ballad.Although it turns out that H\u00e9ctor is actually no longer on speaking terms with Ernesto, Miguel manages to get into the singer's lavish party with his help. Miguel introduces himself to Ernesto, who cheerfully welcomes him as his great-great-grandson, the two bond at the party and playing together, but just as Ernesto was about to give him his blessing, H\u00e9ctor gets into the party and confronts Miguel, feeling betrayed that the boy has reneged on their deal. In the confrontation, Miguel points out a detail that prompts H\u00e9ctor to realize that his death had not been accidental, with a scene of one of Ernesto's movies, Miguel figured out that Ernesto and Hector used to be partners in the music industry but Hector wanted to go back to his family so Ernesto poisoned his tequila. After H\u00e9ctor's death, Ernesto used his songs - and his guitar - to become famous. Taking H\u00e9ctor's portrait, Ernesto detains H\u00e9ctor and Miguel in a cenote pit.In the cenote Hector started to fade and yells the name of Coco, which Miguel shows the picture he took from the ofrenda and the two realize that Miguel's great-great-grandfather is H\u00e9ctor. Upon knowing that Coco is dying, Hector will fade if she dies, who is the only living relative that knew him. With the help of Pepita and Dante, who turns out to be a spirit guide, Imelda and the other dead Riveras find them. Although Miguel explains the circumstances of H\u00e9ctor's death, Imelda still won't forgive him but will help save Hector. To retrieve H\u00e9ctor's portrait from Ernesto, they infiltrate his sunrise concert with the aid of Frida. The plan fails when Ernesto recognized them and tries to steal the picture while sings La Llorona with Imelda, but Ernesto is exposed to his fans as a fraud, traitor and killer and gets crushed by the same bell that killed him, echoing his first death.As the sun rises, H\u00e9ctor begins to disappear. To save him, Imelda blesses Miguel without conditions, and he rushes to Coco's side. Using H\u00e9ctor's old guitar, Miguel sings \"Remember Me\", a song that H\u00e9ctor used to sing to Coco during her childhood, which sparks her memory and revitalizes her. She retrieves from a bundle of mementos the missing part of the photo from the ofrenda, with H\u00e9ctor's face. With Coco's support for him, Miguel reconciles with the living Riveras, who accept him and music into their household.One year later, Miguel proudly presents the family ofrenda - which now features a photo of the recently-deceased Coco - to his new baby sister. Miguel's revelations about Ernesto have left him to be forgotten by the world of the living, who now honor H\u00e9ctor in his place as well his legacy. In the Land of the Dead, H\u00e9ctor and Imelda reunite with Coco, then cross the bridge to see their living family, including Miguel, who sings and plays the guitar for the living and deceased Riveras.", "Coco is the latest from Pixar, starring Anthony Gonzalez, Gael Garcia Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Alanna Ubach and a string of many others, and is directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina.\n It tells the (in some ways familiar) story of Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez), whose family upbringing revolves heavily around shoe making, and the business of shoe sales being the career path of all family members and many generations. Miguel, however, dreams of being a musician and breaking out in the arts, much to the strict disapproval of his family. He looks up to his idol, legendary musician, Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), playing the classical Mexican-infused sounds of the 30s and 40s. Along the way to achieving this dream, Miguel finds himself in The Land of the Dead, where he meets a series of deceased skeletal characters, such as Hector (Gale Garcia Bernal), Mama Imelda (Alanna Ubach) and Ernesto De La Cruz himself (Benjamin Bratt), all of whom were involved in Miguel's past and/or family in some way.\n So this is a film where I deliberately don't want to give away too much of the plot and the twists and turns within, because there are some surprises thrown into this very tightly written screenplay, helmed by directors Lee Unkrich, Adrian Molina and two others. Usually a bad sign when there's more than a few writing credits (Spider-Man: Homecoming), Coco succeeds for a number of reasons. \n As mentioned, parts of the story will be familiar to many, but this is an example of when it's the details of the film that truly make it, as opposed to the overall general big picture. To quote Roger Ebert, \"it's not about what it's about, it's about how it's about it\". In common storytelling, there's only very few general story outlines we here from synopsis to synopsis, movie to movie, but it's the details and variations of those storylines that truly make a film. Examples are tone, pacing, dialogue, music, performance, world building, sound design, editing, themes and infinite other styles and subtexts. In the case of Coco, the pace and charm and wit and energy behind the, in theory, familiar storyline and themes are what makes it.\n This truly is a wonderful, uplifting and entertaining piece by Pixar. The directions the story takes, as is the case with most original Pixar films, is complex and thematic. It deals with memory, death, dementia, passion, drive, family values, rebellion and more, while still remaining accessible and child friendly, unlike Inside Out, which I know is an unpopular opinion. But most of all Coco is damn fun! The colours simply explode and radiate, and the animation of the character, world, production design and environment is truly arresting and detailed, without feeling overloaded and bloated. \nThere's bits in the beginning that were reminding me of a less traumatising/horrifying, and more Disneyified Spirited Away, in a \"innocent character suddenly finds themselves thrown into an unfamiliar parallel universe full of the macabre\" kind of way. \n I think my few flaws with the film are simply that it could've been a little funnier. All throughout there's fun slapstick, such as feral yet charming dog is so excited that it's drooping tongue wraps around its head, and skeletons being able to pull themselves apart and change body shapes etc, which would have been an animator's dream to create. I didn't find that there were memorable laugh out loud jokes, such as the sloths, or The Godfather throwback in Zootopia, or many other hilarious scenes you come away from gawking about from other Pixar works, such as Monsters Inc, the Toy Stories and The Incredibles. There's also things revolving around the story which I don't want to give away, but just very minor nitpicks surrounding tiny character decisions/reactions/motivations that perhaps don't quite click perfectly in place.\n Overall Coco is a movie I could recommend to anyone and everyone over the age of 5, it's the most emotional I think I've ever been in a Pixar film, there's true beauty and charm behind it, the story and characters are all very engaging, the voice acting and singing/music is beautiful, particularly from the talents of Anthony Gonzalez, look out for him in the future. It's paced excellently, the 103 minutes fly by, and the songs are simply lovely.", "So I just saw coco...It was great. It has amazing animation, interesting plot, great music, likeable characters and so on. Pixar can always bring such an amazing movie all the time. But there are some things which really bothers me. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely worth seeing, but there are some issues, that I must point out.For instance, one of the main protagonist Hector, really reminded me of Flynn from tangled. From looks to performance and attitude and so on. Like pixar has some characters, which must be in the movie and that must be always repeating.Or if you want another example, look at that dog Dante. We have seen that animals, which behave like that in frozen (olaf), tangled (that lizard) or in every another pixar movie.I don't say it will not entertain you, but my opinion is, that pixar just repeats himself and doesn't bring anything new. Maybe some things are new, but if I will point them out, they will spoil you the movie.Over all, It is definitly worth seeing.

Much of the story is based on a couple of simple misunderstandings. It's very coincidental that way, much more so then most other Pixar films. However they were able to convey this well enough to be believable. It doesn't always work as much as I'd like, being a tad predictable at times. But in order to fix this they'd also lose many of the sentimental scenes. Which are heartbreaking and greatly enhance the experience I had.Now what was really entertaining was the amount of richness in cultural aspects. To understand the conflicts of this world, they had to introduce us to Mexican tradition. These details are hidden in the fabric of the whole movie. The world building brought me close to it's characters. It's a prized experience and gives people like me that don't know much about day of the dead a loving introduction.I highly recommend this to people foreign to the concept of the day of the dead.", "I'm starting to notice a trend with PIXAR over the last few years; good, bad, mediocre.

The only part I did not like was the end, it started to get kid of slow with the picture, that is all they did for about for about 20 minutes of the film just trying to get that picture.", "'Coco' is another Disney-Pixar animation instant-classic, with an excellent, touching story, good music, in testing characters and great visuals. It's also something a bit different - set in Mexico and following Miguel (Gonzalez), a boy who is accidently trapped in the Land of the Dead as he tries to escape. Even though all the spirits are depicted as skeletons, it's not as sinister as it sounds - still very suitable for kids.Miguel gets transported to the Land of the Dead on \"Dia de Muertos\" (\"Day of the Dead\", when Mexicans honour their ancestors), after trying to learn more about his great-great grandfather (Coco's dad), who was a famous musician - De La Cruz (Bratt - has a hilarious death). With him for the journey is Dante the dog, who provides a lot of the laughs. It's great to see Miguel meeting and interacting with his great uncles and great aunties, who he's only heard about. Plenty of colour, movement and imagination went into the Land of the Dead and it looks great - basically a tiered seaside village. Miguel is helped on his journey to find De La Cruz by Hector (Bernal), who's trying to visit the Land of the Living, as he's afraid he's being forgotten and will soon cease to exist.If you don't have tears in your eyes at some point, then you're probably dead and already in the Land of the Dead! The final 30min is exceptional, with a great twist and plenty of heartwarming moments. This is almost as good as 'Up' - huge praise from me! There's some laughs, some songs, lots of fun, but most importantly the film really highlights the importance of family and honouring those who have come before you - extremely touching at times.", "I've read so many reviews about this film that I can positively say that the one thing missing is the fact that cinema is first and foremost Art, not technology or any other intrinsic part of movie making. Art is emotion and Coco delivers more emotion and heart than some of us can bear, I've had this film stuck in my mind for over a month now and I can't get over it, maybe, just maybe because it didn't actually land in my head but in my heart. So, yes it's not perfect... just unforgettable, and in my book that's the reason of cinema.p0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This is definitely the most wonderful animated masterpiece that Pixar has ever delivered since Toy Story and given the fact that it is the first musical being created by Pixar, it is also one of the kind.In addition, Coco really delivered a touching, emotional and warm tone and depth, an effective story as well the importance of diversity and most importantly its theme particularly family and passion of music, which really exemplifies Pixar and Disney as one of the best animation companies. By a way of a good message, Coco is really a love letter to Mexico.With its sumptuous visuals and its realism displayed in an animated film, truly it is a feast to the eyes and in addition a wonderful and memorable song pieces by the composers behind the wonderful Frozen, such song pieces particularly the main song will definitely give a satisfying touch and heart.This heartwarming masterpiece should really encouraged for everyone (whether child or adult) to see it.", "Coco may have been one of the best films that I saw in 2017, and I saw a lot of movies!

It's a feast for the eyes. I don't think there is a single scene where fluorescent orange, purple, and lime green are not onscreen at once, complementing each other beautifully. The songs are enjoyable and well sung. Each character is fully realized. Miguel Rivera, a little boy, is the lead. He is adorable to look at and charmingly played by newcomer Anthony Gonzalez.The plot is a bit complicated and I'm not sure that children would understand it. The theme is an adult one: how do you balance love of family and tradition with innovation and self-actualization? I'm not sure kids would fully grasp that, either. But there is enough onscreen business - chases, animals, and costumes - to keep children entertained. The plot has much in common with \"The Wizard of Oz.\" A child travels to an otherworldly realm, and is accompanied by an earthly companion who is transformed into a magical creature in that realm. The child faces dangers and learns lessons he can apply once he returns to normal life.I was deeply moved by the movie. I had tears running down my face during the final segment. The plot twists astounded and gratified me. This film had more of a plot than many an adult movie I've seen recently.Yes, \"Coco\" is an anti-Christian movie. Though it takes place in Mexico, I could not find any vestige of Catholicism in the film. I may have blinked and missed it. \"Coco\" creates both life in a Mexican village and a Mexican afterlife, and I saw no churches. There was a place named \"Santo\" something - that was the only sign of Catholicism I caught.There are many signs of Aztec belief. Skulls are everywhere, as they were in monumental Aztec architecture and in images of Coatlicue, the Aztec goddess. Chrysanthemums, the Aztec flower of the dead, are also omnipresent. A very bad character has a very Christian name. I can't say more so as not to reveal any plot twists. And \"Coco\" presents its own, pagan-inspired afterlife. Spirits remain \"alive\" as long as someone on earth places their photograph on a pagan altar called an \"ofrenda.\" After that, they really die. And spirits are accompanied by alebrijes, brightly colored chimeras. Aunt Imelda's alebrije is a winged, horned, jaguar.Christian parents should allow their children to see this beautiful film, and should discuss it with their children afterward.", "Hope this movie gets nominated in the Best Picture category because it deserves to be there.\nIf Toy Story UP Inside Out Wall-E made you cry than you are going to need a lots of tissues for this one too.It shows how we should remember our loved ones when they are not around us.The music in this movie the songs the animation everything is just perfect.I just wonder sometimes how Pixar makes movies about death and seperation so beautifully.Its not just a movie for kids its for the adults too.

I was wrong. Very wrong. The movie is a natural insight into the Mexican culture (specifically the Day of the Dead) that is both engaging, interesting and inclusive. It doesn't feel like it's just Hollywood pandering to an audience, it doesn't abuse stereotypes of what the executives think people might like or want to see and most importantly they didn't whitewash the cast.The premise alone is extremely unique and engaging, throughout the whole movie it kept me guessing what would happen next. It's fast-paced, colourful, the characters are very well thought through. I was most amazed at the quality of the animation, it's absolutely mind-boggling, every little tiny detail that you would never even notice is there. It all really feels like a work of art that celebrates the Mexican culture. I also really enjoyed the fact that it had a fresh story structure where the world isn't ending and the hero doesn't have to defeat the ultimate evil but rather focuses on human issues and values.In fact, it's one of those rare movies that had me bawling my eyes out at the theatre.Anyways, I wanted to keep this review short and not go into deep details because it's worth experiencing.Coco is fun, emotional and fresh!

Directed by Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3), it is a touching story about the importance of family and tradition passed on from generations past.In a small Mexican town, a young boy named Miguel aspires to become a famous musician like the popular actor/singer Ernesto de la Cruz. However, due to a long-running ban on music enforced throughout his family, Miguel keeps his dream a secret from his relatives. On the night before the Day of the Dead festival, Miguel accidentally finds himself transported into the Land of the Dead, where he decides to seek out his great-great grandfather to help him return to the Land of the Living.While not quite as clever and humorous as other works from Pixar, Coco is certainly one of the most heartfelt and charming stories in their film library to date. The film does a fine job of showcasing some intriguing aspects of Mexican culture and family tradition in a quirky but respectful manner. There were several moments that felt highly reminiscent of the Studio Ghibli classic Spirited Away, with its fascinating depiction of the afterlife and the beings who make their home there. The animation, as to be expected, is visually gorgeous to look at and the Land of the Dead felt so vibrant and alive, rather ironically. The voice acting is solid, especially from newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, but Benjamin Bratt also shines. These are the types of films Pixar should continue making for audiences and not sequels for the sake of merchandising and money, like the Cars series.I rate it 8.5/10", "Pixar has always been humorous and insightful and innovative...but I'm not sure their previous stories have ever been this breathtakingly beautiful.

The way that this story was portrayed is none other than amazing. The design and attention to detail put into this movie is outstanding, and like no other movie I have seen before. When I saw the land of the dead for the first time, the buildings are stacked high in the sky, colorful, almost none looking like the other, and things that I have never imagined were put onto one screen. Amazing visuals, and a dream to look at. I will be honest, the style of music portrayed in the movie is not the style that I usually like. But this movie made it enjoyable for me! I loved the guitar, and the songs that were played on it. They were beautiful! \nOverall a joy to see and hear!The plot is wonderful, the characters are wonderful, and I loved how they told the story. It isn't another cheesy plot where a kid goes somewhere to achieve his dream, only to be stopped by someone, and then achieves it in the end. NO! It is not like that. It has twists and turns, and in the end, he does more than just achieve his dream. He learns about his own heritage and the importance of family. He learns what matters most. When we learned that the Ernesto was actually Miguel's relative, that was a shock. But it was even more of a shock when we learned that he was the bad guy, and that he only cared about himself. What was even MORE of a twist was when we learned that Ernesto was lying, and that Hector, Ernesto's best friend, is actually related to Miguel. On TOP of that, we find out that Ernesto MURDERED Hector, and stole all his songs and took the credit. That is pure evil. There is so much to take in with this movie, but it is still all so understandable! The movie ends with a resolution, and the way that the problems are resolved are like no other, and are so unexpected.The comedy in this movie fit well too. When I think of many animated movies much like this one, I think of cheesy, tried-to-hard-to-be-funny jokes, lines, and actions. This movie was different. The comedy fit well, and was not overdone. It gave the moment the emotion it needed, and when silliness was not needed, it wasn't there. The jokes and funny scenes went with the flow of the movie...Overall this movie is one of my new favorite movies, under Inception and Fight Club, both extremely good movies.

PERFECTO!0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Pixar story about a young boy who wants nothing more than to be a musician, except that his shoemaker family has forbidden music due to the boy's great great grandfather abandoning the family long ago to pursue a life as a musician (Coco is the boy's very elderly great grandmother, and daughter of the shunned musician). The film takes place during Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday where families remember and celebrate their deceased relatives, and when the film's hero, Miguel, discovers his runaway relative is actually the famous star of music and film, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice by Benjamin Bratt), he sets out to seize his moment by entering a music contest, only to find himself transported to the colorful and vibrant land of the dead. There he find a world populated by skeletal deceased relatives waiting to be remembered by their families so they can return to the world of the living to once again be with their descendants and loved ones. Miguel must find a way back to the world of the living before the end of the night, but that's not as easy as he expects when he discovers his relatives in the land of the dead also continue to hold music in contempt and refuse to help unless he renounces music. But wait! Ernesto de la Cruz is a relative and a musician, but he's just as famous in death as he was in life, so for Miguel to get to de la Cruz is no easy task. Miguel is aided on his quest by H\u00e9ctor, a down-on-his-luck character who claims to know de la Cruz, but who is beginning to fade away from this world because his family no longer remembers him. Without spoiling any plot points, it's the themes of family and being remembered by your children and descendants that tugs at the heart strings and is at the core of the film. Pixar does sentiment better than anyone (I still get weepy just thinking of Bing Bong's farewell scene from \"Inside Out\"), where it's rarely maudlin or saccharine, and is typically genuine and easily identifiable. The idea of being forgotten by your family is one that will hit home for parents watching the film, and the themes around family connections will be identifiable for both kids and adults. Setting the story aside for a second, I haven't even mentioned the film's lively music (\"Remember Me\" is a real ear-worm), it's clever sense of humor (Miguel's street dog friend steals most every scene he's in), and the film's eye-popping visuals. It's also very cool for a major studio film to not feature a single anglo character and to instead feature a characters outside the dominant culture of the United State. My main complaint about the film is it's over reliance on plot devices and episodic adventures that were rather forced and relied once too often on coincidence, but I'm sure this will only annoy adults and the kids won't even notice. Overall, \"Coco\" is a solid entry in the Pixar canon of films, and athough it's not quite up to \"Monsters Inc.\" \"Up\" or \"Toy Story 3\" standards of greatness, it's still far better than any of the \"Cars\" movies.", "My wife was not a fan of cartoon which she thought is too na\u00efve for an adult. \nThis movie changed her mind.\nShe cried in the theater and so did half of the audiences. \nIt's great movie, promoting family bonds, fighting for dreams, and Mexican traditions. \nI am not Hispanic but I am a conservative guy who admire and respect traditions. \nPixar is really good at storytelling. There was not even a single second that I was thinking something else but indulged all the time. \nThe pictures are beautiful. \nThe story is compelling with a few nice surprises.\nThe ending is flawless.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "The movie is well researched in terms of the Mexican culture of 'Dia de Muertos' - day of the dead.

I went inside the theater with high expectations and this movie met them and exceeded them . The movie had an amazing script at their disposal , add to that a spectacular cast , great direction and musical score and you get a movie which is amazing . I generally don't like animated movies but this one was really good .0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "A fantastic movie. Touching, smart script, exceptional animation work, superb photography, ideal duration. I watched it with kids 9 and 10, they were completely focused on film. The older one got emotional. Congratulations to everyone involved.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "From a Mexican viewer I can only tell you that I loved the movie.It was so beautifully done. The colors, the music, the characters, the little details like the food, the camino de cempas\u00fachil, the pi\u00f1atas, a lot of things we can notice during the movie . Yes, I cried. And btw my dad didn't fell asleep like he usually does. In fact he liked the movie a lot.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "This movie is great to watch with the family, but maybe a bit boring for little kids\nIt takes some time to build the story but overall is a good one, good at least to understand a bit more what's the deal with \"dia de los muertos\", Mexican culture and music\nOnly downside is maybe too much Spanish? It was without subtitles (in New Zealand) for the many many Spanish words and short phrases around, that may be awkward for some people not so into foreign movies\nMusic is good, plot is simple, it won't let you down0 out of 16 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Ok as I walked into the theater to see coco I was having mixed feelings about it and I must rave I really enjoyed it myself I loved the animation the heart the feelings of family and what humor there was worked though personally I would have asked for more humor I did enjoy the movie and I can only say as a word of caution is if your kids are scared of skeletons then you might want to consider skipping this one all together otherwise you should have no problem enjoying this movie0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "It has been a while since I enjoyed a film this much, even though it didn't introduce new extravagant graphics and CGI effects, but who cares? we go to theaters for the story!! and that is what Pixar manages to nail every single time! it is all about captivating stories and relatable characters even if they were kids, toys, fishes, robots.. or even dead skeletons! They always do it right and never let us down with extra cheesiness, clich\u00e9s or commercialness. One more point that Disney always does: Opening gates to new cultures, I've always felt that the idea of cherishing the dead in Mexican holidays kind of creepy, but now I value it to the extent of planning my next family vacation to Mexico and time it with their holidays! So thanks again Pixar.. thanks Disney, looking forward your next epic!0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "Since its inception, Pixar has prided itself on creating films for the entire family. This shouldn't be confused, of course, with the mildly derogatory label of 'family-friendly', which is usually slapped on movies cobbled together to distract children, while also driving their parents to distraction. Rich, deep and profound, Pixar's films are something else altogether. They may star toys, cars, bugs, fish and rats, but they deal with universal themes like growing up, loss and depression. And now, Pixar is dealing with death as well - Coco is a bold, tender meditation on living and dying that is as morbid as it is marvellous.All 12-year-old Miguel (voiced by newcomer Gonzalez) wants is to sing and strum his guitar, entertaining the masses just as the late superstar, Ernesto de la Cruz (Bratt), did. Unfortunately, he must adhere to a strict ban on music that has been imposed within the family for generations - a decision taken by his great-great-grandmother, Imelda (Ubach), after her husband abandoned the family to pursue his dream of becoming a musician.Determined to enter his town's D\u00eda de los Muertos talent show, Miguel sneaks into de la Cruz's mausoleum to borrow his idol's iconic guitar. When Miguel touches the instrument, however, he finds that he now has the ability to enter the Land of the Dead - an afterlife bursting with every colour of the rainbow and populated by those who have shuffled off the proverbial mortal coil.Coco checks quite a few boxes on Pixar's preferred list of tropes and themes. It's a coming-of-age story, as Miguel learns not just the cost and value of his dreams, but also the importance of family. Woven into the narrative, too, is an odd-couple road trip of sorts, as Miguel cuts a deal with the eccentric, big-hearted Hector (Bernal) - a deceased resident desperate to cross over to the Land of the Living - and they set off on an epic adventure to locate the legendary de la Cruz.Familiar though it may occasionally be in terms of plot and predicament, Coco taps into something joyfully fresh in its setting and scenery. It's not the first time the Mexican conception of the afterlife has underpinned an entire animated movie; that honour belongs to 2014's quaintly quirky The Book Of Life.But Coco makes it all erupt off the screen in a charming, chaotic tumble of colour. It's no coincidence that the film, which gets off to a deceptively slow start, explodes into kaleidoscopic life once it enters the Land of the Dead. Suddenly, Miguel is consorting with neon-bright spirit creatures and skeletal figures so expressively animated that they can easily skate a fine line between sad, snarky and sinister.All the eye-popping colour and design in the world would mean little, however, if the film ultimately failed to capture audiences' hearts. Fortunately, there's little danger of that happening where Coco is concerned. In fact, be warned - keep a firm hold of your heart and your composure, because you might find yourself losing both before the final credits roll.Underscored by an utterly gorgeous soundtrack soaked in love and loss, Coco serves up some potent reminders of the power, value and importance of family - with a few perfectly crafted twists along the way. The film is all the stronger for weaving Miguel's relatives from the great beyond into his narrative, allowing them to cast both light and shadow on his life-changing adventure. Imelda, for instance, comes into her own as a sharp, unforgettable voice and presence. As Miguel makes friends, choices and mistakes in the Land of the Dead, it becomes clearer just how Imelda's story continues through his, and how his tale is shaped by her decisions and heartbreak.Taken altogether, Coco will leave you with a devastating, but also powerfully uplifting, sense of how our dearly departed never really leave us. We are who they helped us to be, and they live on as long as their stories are remembered. That's a remarkably brave concept for a film meant for the entire family to tackle, but it's one that Pixar pulls off with flair and care to spare. Just be prepared to have some seriously grave conversations about life and death with the little ones...", "12/7/17. Saw this in the theater today, and so glad I did! What a wonderful celebration of the power of music and the Mexican tradition of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead)! While it may seem morbid for those not familiar with this celebration, I think it is a wonderful way to take 3 days to celebrate the memories of loved ones who have died, and the healing power of having a connection with one's past. Wonderfully done, with a little plot twist to keep the adults entertained, this movie is worth catching.0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink", "being that I am Mexican, I related very well to this movie. It had just enough humor and of course considering what it is about, it had just enough sadness. Bring the tissues for sure. This movie reminded me so much of my grandma and made me miss her but put a smile on my face knowing she is watching over me. well done!0 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"]
