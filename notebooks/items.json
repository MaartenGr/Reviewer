Of course, the portrayal of Latin Americans and their culture in this film are sugar-coated, but it gives one insight into the Northern American's perception of Latin America.

The basic premise here is that Donald Duck is celebrating his birthday, and a large package of presents is sent to him from friends in several Latin American countries.

{"title": "The Three Caballeros (1944) - IMDb", "text": ["\"The Three Caballeros\" is one of the most unusual of oddities in the Disney animated canon. It's arguably the package feature which requires to be seen altogether the most (that is not to say that these such films deserve to go cut up and remain only viewed as separate short subjects and featurettes; it's just that they could and have easily been viewed as separate things). Regardless, it still doesn't have much of a plot. Donald Duck receives a whole load of birthday presents from his friends in Latin America, the first of which he opens being a film reel exhibiting short subjects concerning Latin American themes and stories. However, the film soon deviates as Donald's eccentric friends Jose Carioca (a parrot from Brazil) and Panchito (a rooster from Mexico) arrive and via the use of some magic gifts transport Donald to their respective countries, where live-action actors and animated settings and beings interact. In my opinion, the second and third acts of the film (the first act being the assorted short films) cannot really be viewed out of context, so in some ways, the film walks the line between single story feature (such as \"Snow White\", \"Pinocchio\", \"Dumbo\" etc) and package feature.", "For those who don't know much about the context in which the film was made (I suspect that most people who are visiting this page, however, are animation buffs who will know a bit about this film), \"The Three Caballeros\" was, like the earlier \"Saludos Amigos\" (a similarly unusual entry in Disney's library of animated features), a by-product of the American government pressuring Disney to create films based around Latin American themes in order for the USA to woo neutral South America during the Second World War away from anything Axis, and respectively also make Yankees appreciate all things South of the Border. There are hints to the propaganda purposes (such as the general \"OMG, aren't Mexico and Brazil so cool?\" tone as well as the birds of South America being dubbed \"Donald's cousins\"), but overall, the film doesn't seem too dated, or as much as everyone says it has.", "\"The Three Caballeros\" is actually rather surreal. I honestly believe that such a far-out film would never get made today by such a prominent studio. It's the trippiest of Disney's animated classics easily. \"Alice in Wonderland\", as everybody jokes, is a bit of an LSD-fest in places, but its storybook roots keep it from seeming like the result of drinking something from a bottle marked \"DRINK ME\". And the high-brow spirit of \"Fantasia\" and its Rackham-esquire look has always prevented me from labelling it as truly trippy. Much of \"The Three Caballeros\", however, is so crazy that I wondered if I'd taken something by accident. The main background throughout the film is vague, changing colour to suit the mood of the scene, and the animation has no limits most of the time (for example, inanimate objects and things come to life like random, the laws of physics are disobeyed very much so and characters morph and multiply at the drop of a hat). There's even some early experiments with mixing animation and live action thrown in. Some of it is kinda lame - Aurora Miranda, playing a Brazilian cake seller, looks like she's simply walking in front of a screen where footage of Donald Duck is playing - however, some effects are quite good, such as animated cockerels morphing into live men.", "Overall, \"The Three Caballeros\" is a good film. Admittedly, the first act doesn't match the second and third act very well (it actually seems like left-overs from the tamer sister-film \"Saludos Amigos\", and some of the surrealism gets a bit too baffling to watch (the final ten minutes or so is an example of this sort). And not knowing any Portuguese, Jose Carioca can be difficult to understand, as he often spurts out the odd word or phrase in his native language. Yet the film is most certainly still worth watching, and makes for quite an underrated piece. Also recommended is \"Blame it on the Samba\" from 1948's \"Melody Time\". Whilst generally quite a dull package film, that segment is excellent. I believe that it was planned for \"The Three Caballeros\", though didn't surface until a few years later."]},

There is also much inventive kaleidoscopic animation, every bit as good as the pink elephant scene in Dumbo. This is one of the best animated feature films."]},

They weren't really films.  This one is just a collection of beads from the studio's Latin American years on a pretty string.  Some of the beads are short cartoons, not really any different from Disney's other short cartoons of the period - which is, although I don't need to say this, praise.  To be honest I find it hard to remember, without looking it up, exactly which South American Disney cartoons are featured in this movie and which aren't.", "The linking segments with Donald Duck are weird and - now and then - wonderful.  Disney seems to have tried every possible way of combining animation and live action (the live action is usually Carmen Miranda). Some of the attempts fall flat - many shots are obviously Miranda walking in front of a movie screen onto which Donald Duck is being projected; and the section featuring Donald Duck flying on a magic carpet over South American countryside is just a cheap and gruesome mis-match.  But other times it's dazzling.  The transformation of animated cacti into human dancers, or human dancers into animated roosters, are technical marvels which made me gasp. Perhaps if I saw them on the big screen I'd be able to work out how they were done - but they'd still be spectacular.  More so.", "In short, this certainly has its moments - some of the most anarchic moments Disney or any other studio had produced.  People who aren't fans of animation will probably find it unendurable.  (I don't blame them.  It's not really a film.)  People who are fans HAVE to see it."]},

The year was 1945, and the rage was exoto-tourism.", "The idea was to introduce the United States to the color and excitement of Central and South America. To our main character Donald, the good old-fashioned patriotic American Duck, the worlds shown to him by his Latino bird buddies are far from familiar. Foreign music, seemingly tribal dancing, beautiful women and exotic landscapes overwhelm Donald, and he becomes infatuated. This unknown world holds the same appeal and excitement to Donald and it probably did to countless European explorers. In fact, the scenes depicting the bizarre customs, cultures and landscapes in the movie hold the same kind of colonizing curiosity of earlier times before and during Western exploration. It is human (and maybe even Anatidaean) instinct to be curious about the unknown.", "Unfortunately, it is also human instinct to make generalities. We find here a very large contradiction, perhaps even a paradox. While the cultures of Donald's friends, the Brazilian and the Mexican, are about as similar as a parrot is to a rooster, the film portrays them as almost identical. In Brazil we find a beautiful town full of beautiful people with dark hair and darker eyes, singing dancing and having quite a time. In Mexico, it's about the same, but maybe with more of a vaquero-esquire vibe. It seems The Three Caballeros de-racializes Latin America and disregards Brazil's African roots as well as Mexico's numerous indigenous roots, kneading and forming them into one homogeneous brown-skinned singing and dancing culture.", "So now we know they're friendly. It's okay, we can go for a trip to Acapulco and sunbathe with some beautifully bronzed female Mexican centuplets. We'll drink, we'll dance, we'll embrace and kiss and be merry, however not ever with another male. The film quickly shows that while Latin American men can have a gay time, they certainly aren't gay gay, The rooster (or was it the parrot?) adamantly make this clear by rejecting Donald's kiss. But don't worry; Donald thought he was a girl. Americans sure as hell aren't gay, either.", "Well I feel guilty now for bringing all of this up. I'm sure Disney had the best intentions in introducing the U.S. to the neighbors below. A cartoon-documentary marking the full history of every diverse Latin American country using cell animation in 1945 would take longer to create than the pyramids did. And who knows if it would have held an audience's attention? The point is that despite these intolerant tendencies in The Three Caballeros, whether intentional or due to naivety, the brief exploration of the Latin American unknown in this visually stunning film may have been a pretty decent introduction for a 1945 United States audience."]},

So until Cinderella came around, they only ended up making second rate package films. One of them, being The Three Caballeros, is often cited as one of the better anthology flicks based on public perception and nostalgia, but I have to admit, I found this movie to be too overwhelming in a bad way. I admire it for all the technical wonder that was put into it, but this flick is a jumbled mess.", "Now even though this feature does have a plethora of segments shown throughout, it does actually have somewhat of a narrative. The essential bare bones plot revolves around Donald Duck receiving three individual presents on his birthday. One of them is a projector showcasing several different shorts on birds and winged animals, the other is Jose Carioca showcasing Donald all the wonders of Brazil and Bahia, and the last one is the Mexican rooster Panchito Pistoles showcasing all the wonders of Mexico and a crazy pi\u00f1ata. However, even though these segments are admirable in their own regard, the best way to describe the whole structure of the feature is like being at a party; it's fun at first but then it gets exhausting after some time. The segments in the first act are enjoyable enough on their own, and the musical moments are really fun to watch. Unfortunately, a good chunk of the 2nd act is just dancing and partying without much really going on and the third segment is just Donald trying to get with a beautiful lady....riveting.", "Ironically, the movie tries so hard to cram in as much entertainment value as it can that it ends up becoming an absolute chore to sit through. I will admit that plenty of the segments are fun, but there's so much going on that I find it hard to watch a whole 72 minute long feature consisting of them. Maybe if they were just individual shorts released before other films they would have been more tolerable, but cramming all of them into a movie just makes my head hurt. It doesn't help that when you get down to it, there isn't much of a proper story. All the film does is present three gifts filled with partying and Latino magic and....that's it. I'm not saying every movie needs a traditionally structured plot, but there is little to no momentum in this film at all. Maybe if it ended with Donald's gifts burning or Donald waking up from a dream I would have felt some something, but otherwise I feel as if this film forgot whatever it was supposed to be in the long run.", "In terms of the animation itself, there is certainly a lot of passion shown on screen. The lighting and effects are glorious, the character animation is very cartoony and loose, and even the production design is worth analyzing. As chaotic as the film is, at least the animators knew how to have fun with themselves. In addition, this is one of the first Disney films to mix live-action with animation, and while better usages would come decades later, they actually look pretty convincing for their time. Also, I must give props to the singing and the song choices, as listening to these songs will make anyone jump out of their seat and dance to it all. Although, just because these musical numbers are fun to listen to sporadically does not mean mashing them together is a good idea, and that's why this film kind of fails in the long run.", "I'm not going to lie, I really do appreciate a lot of the small stories, animation, music and even humor of The Three Caballeros, and there's no denying how much effort and craftsmanship was put into it. However, seeing all this great stuff crammed into 72 minutes worth of a movie just feels irritating, because too much of them is way too much to handle. You can have all the dancing and pizazz you want, but when you sacrifice an actual story for it all, something that every film needs to work, it just comes off as tiring and repetitive. If you want to give this a watch, just watch the segments individually, because you'll have a much easier time sitting through them then wasting 72 minutes on a pointless pasteup flick. Thank goodness Disney stopped doing package films after Cinderella became a hit, because the more we would get of this, the less magic would be prevalent."]},

He watches several stories about a cold penguin, a flying donkey and a cigar chewing parrot who introduces him to the beauties (literally) of Brazilian and Mexican culture.", "This film was made in an attempt to expose American audiences to cultures other than their own and encourage understanding - apparently, back in the 1940's, America was an insular country with little tolerance or understanding of the issues regarding the rest of the world (of course, that's all changed now).  Anyway, in trying to do this, it is difficult to fault the film for it's intensions but it is a lot easier to fault it for it's accomplishments.  The basic plot is split into several sections based around several characters.  The first few are more or less cartoons that don't really comment much on the other cultures, but the second half mixes animation with live action in an attempt to show how much fun Brazil and Mexico can be.", "The first half is bright and colourful and may distract young children but the second half is only interesting because it is rhythmic and energetic - but did it help me appreciate Mexico? Nope!  For me, the bigger failing was that this film wasn't very funny.  However I suspected that as I came to it - I am more of a Loony Tunes fan as I prefer the madcap comedy that those cartoons bring rather than the more `wholesome' fun of Disney cartoons of the period.", "If I had to pick one cartoon duck, it would be Daffy of course, and I'm not a big fan of Donald simply because I can't understand what he is saying half the time.  The various other players here are colourful and do what they are required to do but again I prefer a bit of an edge on my characters - and Disney is not the place to get that.  The real people are OK but are not really the people you would have seen in these place at the time (or even now!).  They are very airbrushed and more often than not they are have had `ethnic' qualities reduced to costume in an effort to show how `they look just like us'.", "Overall this is a bright and colourful feature that will distract young children.  It doesn't achieve it's aim of enlightening about other cultures, nor does it have much of a story or laughs to keep adults interesting.

Of course, there are some attractive things, such as the proto-psychedelic animation of Mary Blair that would flourish in \"Alice in Wonderland\" (Disney's most \"stoned\" feature, if you ask me), but almost by rule all is offensive: stereotypes, ridiculous characters or cultural mockery. All the plot offers is Donald Duck opening presents on his birthday, from two Latin American friends: Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Carioca (from \"Saludos Amigos\") and Mexican Panchito (Villa, I suppose).

{"title": "The Three Caballeros (1944) - IMDb", "text": ["\"The Three Caballeros\" is one of the most unusual of oddities in the Disney animated canon. It's arguably the package feature which requires to be seen altogether the most (that is not to say that these such films deserve to go cut up and remain only viewed as separate short subjects and featurettes; it's just that they could and have easily been viewed as separate things). Regardless, it still doesn't have much of a plot. Donald Duck receives a whole load of birthday presents from his friends in Latin America, the first of which he opens being a film reel exhibiting short subjects concerning Latin American themes and stories. However, the film soon deviates as Donald's eccentric friends Jose Carioca (a parrot from Brazil) and Panchito (a rooster from Mexico) arrive and via the use of some magic gifts transport Donald to their respective countries, where live-action actors and animated settings and beings interact. In my opinion, the second and third acts of the film (the first act being the assorted short films) cannot really be viewed out of context, so in some ways, the film walks the line between single story feature (such as \"Snow White\", \"Pinocchio\", \"Dumbo\" etc) and package feature.", "For those who don't know much about the context in which the film was made (I suspect that most people who are visiting this page, however, are animation buffs who will know a bit about this film), \"The Three Caballeros\" was, like the earlier \"Saludos Amigos\" (a similarly unusual entry in Disney's library of animated features), a by-product of the American government pressuring Disney to create films based around Latin American themes in order for the USA to woo neutral South America during the Second World War away from anything Axis, and respectively also make Yankees appreciate all things South of the Border. There are hints to the propaganda purposes (such as the general \"OMG, aren't Mexico and Brazil so cool?\" tone as well as the birds of South America being dubbed \"Donald's cousins\"), but overall, the film doesn't seem too dated, or as much as everyone says it has.", "\"The Three Caballeros\" is actually rather surreal. I honestly believe that such a far-out film would never get made today by such a prominent studio. It's the trippiest of Disney's animated classics easily. \"Alice in Wonderland\", as everybody jokes, is a bit of an LSD-fest in places, but its storybook roots keep it from seeming like the result of drinking something from a bottle marked \"DRINK ME\". And the high-brow spirit of \"Fantasia\" and its Rackham-esquire look has always prevented me from labelling it as truly trippy. Much of \"The Three Caballeros\", however, is so crazy that I wondered if I'd taken something by accident. The main background throughout the film is vague, changing colour to suit the mood of the scene, and the animation has no limits most of the time (for example, inanimate objects and things come to life like random, the laws of physics are disobeyed very much so and characters morph and multiply at the drop of a hat). There's even some early experiments with mixing animation and live action thrown in. Some of it is kinda lame - Aurora Miranda, playing a Brazilian cake seller, looks like she's simply walking in front of a screen where footage of Donald Duck is playing - however, some effects are quite good, such as animated cockerels morphing into live men.", "Overall, \"The Three Caballeros\" is a good film. Admittedly, the first act doesn't match the second and third act very well (it actually seems like left-overs from the tamer sister-film \"Saludos Amigos\", and some of the surrealism gets a bit too baffling to watch (the final ten minutes or so is an example of this sort). And not knowing any Portuguese, Jose Carioca can be difficult to understand, as he often spurts out the odd word or phrase in his native language. Yet the film is most certainly still worth watching, and makes for quite an underrated piece. Also recommended is \"Blame it on the Samba\" from 1948's \"Melody Time\".

Some of the beads are short cartoons, not really any different from Disney's other short cartoons of the period - which is, although I don't need to say this, praise.

Disney seems to have tried every possible way of combining animation and live action (the live action is usually Carmen Miranda). Some of the attempts fall flat - many shots are obviously Miranda walking in front of a movie screen onto which Donald Duck is being projected; and the section featuring Donald Duck flying on a magic carpet over South American countryside is just a cheap and gruesome mis-match.  But other times it's dazzling.  The transformation of animated cacti into human dancers, or human dancers into animated roosters, are technical marvels which made me gasp. Perhaps if I saw them on the big screen I'd be able to work out how they were done - but they'd still be spectacular.  More so.", "In short, this certainly has its moments - some of the most anarchic moments Disney or any other studio had produced.

The year was 1945, and the rage was exoto-tourism.", "The idea was to introduce the United States to the color and excitement of Central and South America. To our main character Donald, the good old-fashioned patriotic American Duck, the worlds shown to him by his Latino bird buddies are far from familiar. Foreign music, seemingly tribal dancing, beautiful women and exotic landscapes overwhelm Donald, and he becomes infatuated. This unknown world holds the same appeal and excitement to Donald and it probably did to countless European explorers. In fact, the scenes depicting the bizarre customs, cultures and landscapes in the movie hold the same kind of colonizing curiosity of earlier times before and during Western exploration. It is human (and maybe even Anatidaean) instinct to be curious about the unknown.", "Unfortunately, it is also human instinct to make generalities. We find here a very large contradiction, perhaps even a paradox. While the cultures of Donald's friends, the Brazilian and the Mexican, are about as similar as a parrot is to a rooster, the film portrays them as almost identical. In Brazil we find a beautiful town full of beautiful people with dark hair and darker eyes, singing dancing and having quite a time. In Mexico, it's about the same, but maybe with more of a vaquero-esquire vibe. It seems The Three Caballeros de-racializes Latin America and disregards Brazil's African roots as well as Mexico's numerous indigenous roots, kneading and forming them into one homogeneous brown-skinned singing and dancing culture.", "So now we know they're friendly. It's okay, we can go for a trip to Acapulco and sunbathe with some beautifully bronzed female Mexican centuplets. We'll drink, we'll dance, we'll embrace and kiss and be merry, however not ever with another male. The film quickly shows that while Latin American men can have a gay time, they certainly aren't gay gay, The rooster (or was it the parrot?) adamantly make this clear by rejecting Donald's kiss. But don't worry; Donald thought he was a girl. Americans sure as hell aren't gay, either.", "Well I feel guilty now for bringing all of this up. I'm sure Disney had the best intentions in introducing the U.S. to the neighbors below. A cartoon-documentary marking the full history of every diverse Latin American country using cell animation in 1945 would take longer to create than the pyramids did. And who knows if it would have held an audience's attention? The point is that despite these intolerant tendencies in The Three Caballeros, whether intentional or due to naivety, the brief exploration of the Latin American unknown in this visually stunning film may have been a pretty decent introduction for a 1945 United States audience."]},

So until Cinderella came around, they only ended up making second rate package films. One of them, being The Three Caballeros, is often cited as one of the better anthology flicks based on public perception and nostalgia, but I have to admit, I found this movie to be too overwhelming in a bad way. I admire it for all the technical wonder that was put into it, but this flick is a jumbled mess.", "Now even though this feature does have a plethora of segments shown throughout, it does actually have somewhat of a narrative. The essential bare bones plot revolves around Donald Duck receiving three individual presents on his birthday. One of them is a projector showcasing several different shorts on birds and winged animals, the other is Jose Carioca showcasing Donald all the wonders of Brazil and Bahia, and the last one is the Mexican rooster Panchito Pistoles showcasing all the wonders of Mexico and a crazy pi\u00f1ata. However, even though these segments are admirable in their own regard, the best way to describe the whole structure of the feature is like being at a party; it's fun at first but then it gets exhausting after some time. The segments in the first act are enjoyable enough on their own, and the musical moments are really fun to watch. Unfortunately, a good chunk of the 2nd act is just dancing and partying without much really going on and the third segment is just Donald trying to get with a beautiful lady....riveting.", "Ironically, the movie tries so hard to cram in as much entertainment value as it can that it ends up becoming an absolute chore to sit through. I will admit that plenty of the segments are fun, but there's so much going on that I find it hard to watch a whole 72 minute long feature consisting of them. Maybe if they were just individual shorts released before other films they would have been more tolerable, but cramming all of them into a movie just makes my head hurt. It doesn't help that when you get down to it, there isn't much of a proper story. All the film does is present three gifts filled with partying and Latino magic and....that's it. I'm not saying every movie needs a traditionally structured plot, but there is little to no momentum in this film at all. Maybe if it ended with Donald's gifts burning or Donald waking up from a dream I would have felt some something, but otherwise I feel as if this film forgot whatever it was supposed to be in the long run.", "In terms of the animation itself, there is certainly a lot of passion shown on screen. The lighting and effects are glorious, the character animation is very cartoony and loose, and even the production design is worth analyzing. As chaotic as the film is, at least the animators knew how to have fun with themselves. In addition, this is one of the first Disney films to mix live-action with animation, and while better usages would come decades later, they actually look pretty convincing for their time. Also, I must give props to the singing and the song choices, as listening to these songs will make anyone jump out of their seat and dance to it all. Although, just because these musical numbers are fun to listen to sporadically does not mean mashing them together is a good idea, and that's why this film kind of fails in the long run.", "I'm not going to lie, I really do appreciate a lot of the small stories, animation, music and even humor of The Three Caballeros, and there's no denying how much effort and craftsmanship was put into it. However, seeing all this great stuff crammed into 72 minutes worth of a movie just feels irritating, because too much of them is way too much to handle. You can have all the dancing and pizazz you want, but when you sacrifice an actual story for it all, something that every film needs to work, it just comes off as tiring and repetitive. If you want to give this a watch, just watch the segments individually, because you'll have a much easier time sitting through them then wasting 72 minutes on a pointless pasteup flick. Thank goodness Disney stopped doing package films after Cinderella became a hit, because the more we would get of this, the less magic would be prevalent."]},

Anyway, in trying to do this, it is difficult to fault the film for it's intensions but it is a lot easier to fault it for it's accomplishments.  The basic plot is split into several sections based around several characters.  The first few are more or less cartoons that don't really comment much on the other cultures, but the second half mixes animation with live action in an attempt to show how much fun Brazil and Mexico can be.", "The first half is bright and colourful and may distract young children but the second half is only interesting because it is rhythmic and energetic - but did it help me appreciate Mexico? Nope!  For me, the bigger failing was that this film wasn't very funny.

The various other players here are colourful and do what they are required to do but again I prefer a bit of an edge on my characters - and Disney is not the place to get that.  The real people are OK but are not really the people you would have seen in these place at the time (or even now!).  They are very airbrushed and more often than not they are have had `ethnic' qualities reduced to costume in an effort to show how `they look just like us'.", "Overall this is a bright and colourful feature that will distract young children.  It doesn't achieve it's aim of enlightening about other cultures, nor does it have much of a story or laughs to keep adults interesting.

Luckily in \"The Three Caballeros\" the action only takes place in Mexico and Brazil. Of course, there are some attractive things, such as the proto-psychedelic animation of Mary Blair that would flourish in \"Alice in Wonderland\" (Disney's most \"stoned\" feature, if you ask me), but almost by rule all is offensive: stereotypes, ridiculous characters or cultural mockery. All the plot offers is Donald Duck opening presents on his birthday, from two Latin American friends: Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Carioca (from \"Saludos Amigos\") and Mexican Panchito (Villa, I suppose). Each time a box is open you watch an animated sequence of native songs (including a horrendous English version of maestro Manuel Esper\u00f3n's \"Ay Jalisco no te rajes\"). Donald Duck (who looks a lot like Donald Trump in his arrogant behavior) even harasses several Latin women, anticipating the days of his namesake.

If Disney has kept \"Song of the South\" out of circulation because of \"offensive treatment of African-American\" this film could deserve the same medicine.

To be certain, Brazil bulldozed favelas to make room for the World Cup stadium (which will probably never get used again).", "I know, this movie wasn't really meant to be serious. Even so, pushing stereotypes is not an authentic way to build goodwill."]},

Imagine! Inter-specie intimacy! In a Disney cartoon! It would have been better off given a PG rating back when it was reissued in 1977 because of the suggestive inter-specie themes. At least this is nowhere as disgusting as the atrocious \"Foodfight!\" (don't get me started on that)."]},

{"title": "The Three Caballeros (1944) - IMDb", "text": ["After Saludos Amigos, another short film collection was commissioned, because Disney had forgotten to say anything about Mexico. That's pretty much the reason for this film's existence, but it rises above that.", "For one, the segments are all much stronger than in Saludos Amigos. It's still mainly just an ad campaign for South America, but I like that they have a framing story where Donald is celebrating his birthday and gets a present from his South American friends. Jos\u00e9 is also back, and we get another new great character, Panchito Pistoles, a Mexican rooster. And yes, the name is kind of awful, but the character itself is a lot of fun.", "The first two segments, The Cold-Blooded Penguin and The Flying Gauchito, are both very good. The comedy is mostly silent and/or physical, the characters are sympathetic and the animation is very nice. There's also a piece about Aracuan Bird, one of the worst earworms in existence. You have been warned.", "The few following segments, Ba\u00eda, Mexico: P\u00e1tzcuaro, Veracruz and Acapulco and You Belong To My Heart are merely more gallivanting around like in Saludos Amigos. They're fun to watch in their own way, the music is very nice, but they drag on for a bit too long and nothing much happens in them.", "Though at least we get the pi\u00f1ata scene and Las Posadas, which are some of my favourite short segments Disney has ever done. Great mood, great atmosphere, flawless animation and all around enjoyment.", "And then we have Donald's Surreal Reverie, which is probably the reason you should see this film. Think Pink Elephants on Parade, but much, much longer and ever crazier. I swear the animators were under some sort of influence, they had to be. It's a mind trip unlike anything Disney has ever produced. And yeah, it's a truckload of fun to watch, not gonna lie.", "The Three Caballeros is still not what I would call a good film. It is better than Saludos Amigos, if only because it's so weird that you cannot help but be intrigued by it. Definitely worth a watch, though, especially if you want to say you've seen them all."]}
