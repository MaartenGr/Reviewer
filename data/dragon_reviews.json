{"How to Train Your Dragon": ["I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon. The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation. 10/10 Highly Recommended", "I saw the trailer and I enjoyed it but I was afraid that all the good parts from the movie will be there and that will be all, like it was with many films lately. That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice. I didn't read the book, so I don't know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldn't hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with - the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real.  I agree it's not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once it's finished bot it's not meant to be. It's just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and I'm 22). The film wasn't too long, it didn't have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all. I don't know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again.  Great special effects and, again, a very lovely dragon.", "HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one \"action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects\" after another. But wait... HTTYD stands apart from these other attempts for a number of reasons. First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer \"gratuitous\" 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. As 3D becomes a staple of high street cinema, directors seem to be finding 3D to be more about adding depth rather than a brief focal-point. That's not to say that there isn't effective use of the 3D wow-factor here; it's just not all the film has to hold attention. Second, a cast of voice talent that does not demand too much consideration of the man/woman behind the microphone is refreshing. Baruchel is not over-playing the sugar or the heroics and, as much as an animated character can be, he is believable and as three-dimensional as the visuals. Butler is not greatly stretched here but manages to stay just the right side of a Mike Myers impression so as not to annoy. How many kids will now think the Vikings were a fearsome race of Americans and Scots? Oh, well!  Third, the plot and dialogue. You may not know the plot and I won't spoil it now. It is straightforward stuff but the pace keeps it interesting for kids and the grown-ups. Younger children may be upset at times and I heard a sob or two at the emotional moments. Nothing too heavy here though, it's just a well-written script with as many actual laughs as I have seen in a kids' film. This is one of the best films so far in this prolific genre and it has been made with passion rather than thrown together to cash-in on the thirst for these films, right now. I would urge all ages to see this film in 3D as the textures are extraordinary and you can't help but be charmed by it all.", "I saw this film in early March, of 2010 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture \"\u0085explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life.\" Heartland gave that award to this film. It's in 3-D and it's gorgeous animation. But what really matters is the story. And it's a good one. At first it seems the main story is about a Viking colony equally distant from nowhere, which is being constantly attacked by a wide variety of marauding dragons. It's a full time job trying to keep the dragons at bay and the Viking warriors are often out on their boats hunting their wily and ferocious opponents. But really the story is about a father and chief of the Vikings who has a young son, Hiccup, who is small and who is a slick, sarcastic talker and who doesn't take orders well, but still seeks respect from his impressive father. At first, his Father will not let his son be a warrior Viking, but later relents to have Hiccup train with the other youngsters. But the young boy gets sidetracked and instead of wanting to kill dragons, the boy befriends them and seeks to understand them. A young and inexperienced son seeking approval of a strong father is an often-told tale. Sons often act foolishly trying to impress their fathers. And fathers often ignore the strivings of their sons. In this case, there is honor and courage on all sides and it is inspiring to watch the father and son wrestle with their relationship. And yes, about the dragons \u2013 they ARE ferocious and talented and aggressive warriors. But their motivations are a mystery that unfolds slowly. And that's the fun of this film. FYI \u2013 There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.", "I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.", "If this is done following the same old beat up formula that Hollywood sticks to with regards to animation, then the dragons will be yakking non-stop. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and  Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a viking kid who happens to be more brains than brawn, more scrawny than buffed, and this of course sets him apart from the rest of his warrior clan folks, who are battle scarred from the constant defense of the village pests - dragons who come from afar to plunder their livestock and setting their houses on fire, so much so that every house on the block is relatively brand new. Wanting to help out in any way he can, he's deemed more of a liability than an asset, especially when even his dad Stoick (Gerard Butler) cannot appreciate his unique, technical talent. In a stroke of uncanny luck, Hiccup downs a flying dragon in the heat of battle, and his compassion meant to set the dragon free, rather than trying to prove himself to be a worthy viking man by killing it. And it's a rare specimen of a dragon too, which would have brought him instant glory. So a bond between man and mythical beast gets struck, and christened as Toothless, this is one pest who slowly grows into a pet, with Hiccup's secret rendezvous resulting in growing appreciation for the species, despite what the knowledge that his kinsman had compiled into a Dragon compendium which details facts all ending with an advisory on compulsory annihilation. The story here is the strength of the film, being witty, smart but never condescending nor insulting the intelligence of the audience. While most characters are caricatures, especially Hiccup's peers, a lot of effort have been put into creating the leads as multi-dimensional and full of heart, and I enjoyed how the characters are so open to their emotions, that it becomes a lot more real than the photo realistic 3D animation and effects. Sure there's the usual father-son misunderstanding and expectations, and how a zero turns to hero, or even the theme of fearing something that we don't fully comprehend, but it's the manner in which the usual got delivered, that made all the difference. Especially so for its anti-war stance, that all it takes is a little step back from the common battle-cry, and instead seek to be understood, by holding out an olive branch, and to understand first. For those who enjoy the mythology of the dragon creature, there are a number of ideas thrown up in the film that would make you nod in appreciation how these got conjured up for the film, and they worked wonders, even though they may be a tad predictable plot wise. And I'm betting that a lot of folks out there will take to Toothless, thanks to its \"stitch\"-ish design similar to Lilo and Stitch (since it's co-director Chris Sander's previous work) and huge saucer like eyes, plus a lovable demeanour built into the character that's always apprehensive, and mischievous. Being the creature that has no track record also helped, since it ropes you into a journey of friendship, bonding and discovery with Hiccup as to how powerful his new found friend can be, not to mention how symbiotic their relationship will evolve into as well. Action junkies will find the action sequences in the film faultless, and the 3D got specifically crafted for certain set action pieces that really had me ducking for cover, for once. Fights are incredible, and always accompanied either by humour that worked without the feeling that it was deliberate nor just tried too hard, coupled with the comedic voice talents such as Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. How to Train Your Dragon is similar to last year's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs - Long titles, great story, beautiful animation and a total delight. Highly recommended, and it goes into my list as contenders for best films of this year!", "With a somewhat unwieldy tile and the lack of the winning Pixar storyline that has dominated the Oscars for a decade, Dreamworks animations latest could have been a clunker. Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up. The latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the clich\u00e9) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined. The texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways. On the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching. Joining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means. Along with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon. Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com", "incredible! certainly the front runner for the best animated film of the year. from the first to the last frame this film is as good as an animated film gets on almost every level. beautifully written, designed and executed. though an incredible movie, it's not quite perfection - probably due to time and budget limitations (is there ever enough of either?). that said, the problems i had are far too few to mention. if dragon doesn't absolutely slay at the box office i'll lose faith in middle America.  congrats to the filmmakers - you've made a masterpiece and you made me feel like a kid again. thank you.", "Hiccup a young Viking befriends Toothless, a young dragon. This is the best movie I've seen since the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Virtually everything about it is wonderful. Rarely have I been so drawn in to an animated movie. The 3D aspects are thrilling and the movie has a great story, amazing animation, non stop action and a positive and constructive message. It made me want to go out and get a pet dragon. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. Now I know what a feel good movie is. This movie will make everyone feel good. Congratulations to all who contributed to this amazing film. It will make toy dragons a popular gift item. Hope to see it again and again. 3D at it's best.", "Great, loved it so much. Amazing Good voice acting Loved the books Great author. Great story and other stuff. Animations was good, relate able characters and histrionically accurate. Captures the time of the great and wonderful empire of the vikings. One of the best movies of recent years", "There are a lot of excellent reviews out there, I will just discuss a single point. What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it's about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters. This is definitely one of the best 2 animation movies this year, with Toy Story 3 being the other one, tough job for the academy awards this year, and hope this is the case every year. It's nice to see beautiful animation movies challenging Pixar's, it definitely benefits the viewer the most. How to train your dragon - Highly Recommended.", "I'm not a big fan of animation but I like this movie very much. I consider this is the greatest animation movie created so far. This movie is constituted by great story line, splendid background music, amazing animation and breathtaking brawls.\nAs for the story line, I can tell that it is very unique as well as heart touching. That's one thing, you will definitely enjoy while watching the movie. One will enjoy wild but growing friendship between Hiccup and the dragon. A good story line along with satisfactory and delightful background music makes this movie prominent.\nOn the other hand superb and impeccable animation will draw you into the chair until the movie is finished. Fight scenes are spectacular and humorous. I'm pretty sure that after watching this movie everyone will watch it multiple times.", "This has to be one of the best films I've seen with my family. The characters came to life and was instantly hooked. I've young children and they hardly flinched throughout. The draw to the screen was virtually magnetic. A definite must see for all the family, and the 3d version bought it to life, totally!! The story was well written, even though I must admit the start was a bit slow, but all in all well done dream-works. You've another winner on your hands here. p.s. can't stop talking about it, and its been a week since I've seen it- I can see Oscars in the not too distant future.", "There's a reason why I watched How To Train Your Dragon 7 times when it was still playing in theatres. No, it wasn't because I was young and didn't know how to better manage my money (although to be honest, it was a little bit of this). It's because HTTYD had a unique way of unfolding its story. A story about an unlikely relationship that truly moved my heart--between the now very well-known dynamic-duo, Hiccup and Toothless. Throughout the movie, you see each of them grow in awareness about one another, but also in awareness about themselves. This, I think, is what makes their relationship so much more than what meets the eye: before they even know it, they are accepting themselves for their own insecurities and learning not to judge others by first glance.  To top off the many hidden lessons, the screenplay is nicely paced and super quirky/funny (a lot of laughs in all the right places). I also think John Powell did an excellent job with the soundtrack (and when I'm not watching the movie, I sometimes just listen to the soundtrack--yes, you could say I'm just a little obsessed).  Ever since I was little to today, I have always managed to feel the same childish wonder and magic that I felt that first time I saw HTTYD in a movie theatre. And I can honestly say that I don't think that feeling will ever go away.", "An animated feast for the eyes is a brilliant description for this film. From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didn't disappoint. Our protagonist is Hiccup, a boy viking who doesn't possess much in common with his dragon slaying dad. However, when he finds a new friend in Toothless, the most feared dragon of its species, he learns that dragons are not the fearful creatures he was brought up to believe. What I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon. This was dealt with wonderfully and we see their relationship develop over a series of scenes which were done with great humour and action. The 3D holds its own in every sense, and I would go as far as saying that some scenes rival the groundbreaking Avatar. The scenes that especially stood out were the flying segments where the dragon soars over crystal clear sea's and jaw-dropping backdrops. Whilst this is a film that may seem as if it's solely directed at the younger generation, its stunning visuals and well-told story means that it will keep any adult satisfied.", "It's far better then all those Shrecks, Toy stories, Ratatoulies, Puss in boots, Mega-minds and other \"renewing\" concepts. Why? It's simple and honest. This movie doesn't TRY to be funny, modern, super-wise, and \"for all\". It's not one of those \"hey-let's-make-a-movie-about-cat-who-is-a-super-spy\" concepts. This movie JUST tells the simple yet very good story in the most proper way. I have seen a lot of 3D animated movies - American, European, Asian. This one hits 10 in my opinion, because it's by far the most complete vision enclosed in a 3D animated form. But - in addition - it's a pure fairy tale in the core. And I mean PURE - from the cores of fairy-telling, which is the most polite, elegant way of TEACHING important stuff. I think that 3D movie is not only craftsmanship behind creating artificial environment, animating believably, lighting sets with care, etc., etc. Like any other movie - it should be a well told story, which will left you ...CHANGED a bit (that's what fairy tales do, right?) Only those kind of stories will matter in your life. Rest is just \"fun\". 'How to train your dragon' is a modern fairy tale. It's modern because - like other mainstream 3D movies - it's excellently crafted. We have here great animation (Toothless, the dragon is \"made of life\", so to speak - you actually just want to HAVE one), lighting and cinematography (splendid flight scenes, which take your breath away, and make you climb your chair), effects, etc.... But it's a fairy tale because - above all that - we have here a master degree directing by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders too. All those decisions made by them - from very basic (like the look of Toothless and other characters, or editing), to more important (like balancing the amounts of fear, sadness, seriousness and fun tones in the story) are marks of wisdom. And those decisions made a difference between this movie and \"the rest\". Those decisions crafted a SOUL in it. And achieving this \"soul level\" should be a goal of every director. Summing up: great movie in at least two aspects. Technically (character design, animation, cinematography, editing) and emotionally (great simple story with surprisingly 'non-hollywoodish' wise moral, fantastic heart-touching score by John Powell, and mature directing which guide you to be changed a bit after watching). Best achievement in 3D storytelling since Euclide :)", "Warning: this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive! As soon as it's over you'll immediately want to watch it again. I'm a grown man, but somehow this movie managed to ignore all the layers of cynicism and fake toughness we grown-ups tend to build around ourselves to cope with life; it cut right through to the wide-eyed, adventure-loving boy in me, right through to the heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this movie, with these characters - especially if you love wild animals. This beautiful story of a very unlikely friendship between a boy who's a bit of an outcast and a dragon is just so well done; it's never cheesy, yet full of passion, and there's simply not a dull moment in it. And although it's very funny, this really isn't just an accumulation of gags and one-liners loosely held together by a paper-thin story: this is a great adventure and touching coming-of-age tale where the protagonist has an actual arc; it tells an intelligent and compelling story about people who are not just one-note characters, and they're wonderfully realized through the great voice-work of such actors as Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson. The animation is fantastic, and there's so much playful creative energy at display in the design of the characters - especially in the design of all the different dragon species - that it's simply a joy to watch. 10 stars out of 10.", "This was one of the moments, when you feel so overwhelmed by a movie, that you want to see it again immediately.And when i think of how the whole movie-going began-a theater, full of annoying, noisy kids, 3-th graders mostly. But in the end, you realize you haven't spent any time listening to them, because you are so fascinated by the movie.You feel you are alone in the otherwise overcrowded theater.This feeling is very precious and when you realize it, you know you loved it. The whole idea is very interesting-alternate Dragon-fighting times, an era of vikings and so many kinds of winged creatures.The main character, Hiccup, is the son of a mighty Dragon fighter-Stoick, who is the vikings chief as well.He wants to teach his son the Dragon fighting ways of the vikings, but the boy befriends one of the Dragons, a very rare kind, almost impossible to find.He names it Toothless and they are in for a lot of adventures. The movie is very fresh, but solid and strong as well.And considering it is an animation, the voice performances are very good.That is also important.But the truly strongest sides of the movie are the heart of the movie-it is really a moving picture, but i think, that the level of maturity of the movie is higher, than DreamWorks's previous efforts like \"Shrek\".It is more meaningful, and although it is a Dragon-fighting story it is more real than most of the studio's previous tries in this genre and definitely a step up in animation.The feelings, the emotions, that were expressed throughout made this animation such a memorable experience, and i'm sure, i won't be able to forget it, at least not soon. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a new, fresh, different start in the animation genre, with a lot of heart and emotions.I think, that's one of the best animations ever made.I recommend it to everyone-from parents with children to more experienced moviegoers and for the more mature audiences as well. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is the best movie this year so far, and a honestly moving picture.An animation masterpiece! *****/*****", "it's still managed to make me smile, laugh, tear up and excited every time. And I can still watch it a hundred more times, even at this age loooong past my teens, and still be as entertained as the first time round. This has the perfect dosage of wit, humor, drama, action, scattered bits of suspense and...the perfect team of the six riders. The twins never cease to bring that giggle back, even with their old pathetic jokes. I mean, who would've thought to make a voice cast of Jay Baruchel...which has now become almost iconic! Such a perfect amount of time spent on the build-up; especially the bonding; and the climax. It has one of the best (thought through) story lines. Congratulations to the Dreamsworks team on a job well done. And of course to Cressida Crowell for her creations.", "Here's an animated movie that has everything it should have, an inspired, but simple story without jokes intended for the adult parents who have to sit with their kids in the theater. In \"How to train a dragon\", it is the majestic artwork that keeps the viewer engaged, with a mix of funny, colored characters and a less heavy handed screenplay than those of pixar. In some ways that should detract from the movie, but somehow it all works into great fun that takes a grown man back to the fun of childhood. Simple, beautiful and a lot of fun. 8/10", "Beautifully animated and scored. The voice cast was well chosen. The sound design for Toothless in particular is excellent. Friendship developments are nicely paced and heartwarming. The characterization of Toothless is really well done. The 'test drive' scene is captivating. The score syncs wonderfully with the visuals. One aspect of this picture that appeals to me is observational inquiry and trial & error. It's a great message to send to kids and adults alike. Fuel for the imagination. Wonderful in all respects.", "In the Viking village of Berk, all the houses are new since the dwellers are in permanent fight against the dragons. The leader Stoik the Vast is unsuccessfully trying to destroy the fearful Night Fury and locate the dragon's nest to destroy them. His clumsy and inventive son Hiccup works as a blacksmith and dreams on becoming a dragon killer. After a raid of dragons during the night, Hiccup uses the weapon he had invented and he hits the Night Fury. However, he has no witness and nobody in the village believes on his words. Stoik the Vast sails with the Vikings to look for the dragon nest and Hiccup decides to seek out the dragon in the woods, and finds it with a severed tail and can not fly again. Hiccup calls him Toothless and they become friends. The boy uses his skill and manufactures a prosthesis for Toothless and he leans how to control the flight of Toothless. Hiccup learns why the dragons attack his village and finds that his own people had misjudged them. But his great defeat is to prove his father how intolerant the Vikings have been against the dragon. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a delightful animation with a wonderful message of friendship, intolerance, misjudgment, peace and harmony. The directors and writers succeed in telling how important is to understand other people using the metaphor of the dragons in an original way and with an unusual conclusion. The message of this film is highly recommended for politicians, religious leaders, military intelligence and governors of the world. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): \"Como Treinar o Seu Drag\u00e3o\" (\"How to Train Your Dragon\")", "What can i say, superb film: heads and shoulders above anything else I've seen this year. The 3D works brilliantly, you'll come out of this film truly believing that you can fly. The animation is excellent and the cinematography is so appropriate for this slightly darker animation. The opening sequence is brilliant - setting up all conflict, characters and setting at breathless pace and then quickly moving onwards to develop what becomes a surprisingly involved story of friendship, acceptance, love and believing in yourself! However, the dragon: \"Toothless\" is a standout feature of this film.. go to see it just for the scenes where he and Hiccup interact. SPOILER: One scene that stands out is where they learn to fly, the kinetic energy of that scene is unbelievably empowering, one of the few truly great examples of amazing cinema action in recent times. Some people complained that the side characters were underdeveloped, but I strongly disagree; if you watch closely, there's a lot more depth to them than you would have first thought. Only other complaint was that the vikings were Scottish, and their offspring American. But otherwise a fantastic feel good movie... I'll shut up now, leaving you to go see it (In 3D of course)", "When the poster was out for this movie I didn't expect much from it; I thought it would be a typical boring animation. By the time the movie was released I was hearing a lot about it, from friends and critics and shows on TV, so I decided to watch it, not in 3D to my dismay. At the beginning my expectations were high, seeing as there was quite a lot of hype about this movie, however I didn't expect it would be this good. It DEFINITELY exceeded my expectations. I loved it. There was something about it that made it different, and better, than any other animation movie I have watched. It had something for all watchers. Hiccup was innocent and yet had the \"hero\" characteristics in him just like any other movie would have (seeing as he is the main character). The dragons were bold, feared yet I wanted to reach out and pet them and possibly squeeze them with love - especially toothless. When the movie ended all I could say was \"I WANT A DRAGON\".", "I read the book before this movie ever entered theaters. I could tell right from the start that the storyline of the movie had nothing to do with the storyline of the book (except for the names of a few of the characters involved). I am surprised the book even mentions that it is now a \"major motion picture\" considering you can hardly even compare the two. In the movie, the Vikings must defend their food and land from attacking dragons, and the young Vikings are trained to become dragon slayers. Hiccup, the chief's son, is a weakling and a screw up who desperately wants to show his father that he is worth something. When Hiccup ends up catching the only dragon no Viking has ever caught or killed, a \"Night Fury,\" he is unable to slay the dragon and instead ends up training him and keeping him for a pet. His dragon, whom he calls Toothless, gives him insight into how dragons think, and he is then able to defeat all the dragons in the sparring ring quite easily without slaying them. Of course, when it is discovered that Hiccup is now able to fight dragons because he has one for a pet, he is ostracized from the clan. His father, who wants nothing more than to find the dragons' lair and slay all dragons, uses Toothless to find the lair. Little does he know that there is a very large dragon living there, and they must now defeat it, aided by the very dragons he grew to hate. In the end, Hiccup is victorious, gets the girl he loves (Astrid), becomes a hero, gains respect from his peers, and changes Viking life as they know it by making pet dragons commonplace. The book is called \"How to Train Your Dragon\" because the characters must do just that. In order to be considered a true Viking, the characters must go and get their very own dragon from the dragon lair and train it. Only the chief's son (Hiccup) is suppose to get a \"monstrous nightmare\" dragon, however, one of the other characters gets one just to spite him. In the book, the characters learn that the only way to really train your dragon (that the Vikings know of) is to \"yell at it,\" and Hiccup tries everything imaginable to train his dragon, all while being taunted and humiliated by his peers. Dragons in the book are ornery and decidedly un-loyal, and are also small enough to perch on shoulders. Toothless in the book is a whiny, annoying character who refuses to be trained, and is called Toothless because he IS entirely toothless. In fact, Toothless in the book is the most pathetic dragon anybody has ever seen; scrawny with no teeth (and is also a \"common green\" type of dragon, which is the most basic dragon any Viking can have). Hiccup makes up a new species to call him so that he is not made fun of, and assures everybody that he has the rarest type of dragon anybody can have. In the ending of the book, the characters must fight two huge dragons (much like in the movie) and their trained dragons aide them. Hiccup becomes a hero by coming up with and executing a plan to slay the large dragons. There is no female character in the book called Astrid, and the other Viking children are much more developed in the book and play a larger role. Overall, both the movie and the book are thoroughly enjoyable, but anybody who has read the book must not compare it to the movie unless they want to be disappointed. The movie has a slightly cookie-cutter and predictable plot (hero messes up, hero wins respect and girl in the end), but is triumphant and humorous with likable characters and lovely animation. There are several tear-jerking moments in the movie, as well as many laugh-out-loud, witty jokes. Overall, this movie is one for the DVD shelf, and will be liked by both children and adults. I think anybody who saw the movie without reading the books will be in for a surprise if they pick up the book series, and anybody who read the books and sees the movie can appreciate both.", "I remember watching the adorable Disney flick Lilo & Stitch at the theater back in the summer of 2002, after a truly exhausting week. The film - which tells the story of a small girl that befriends a wacky alien she mistakes for a dog - managed to put an enormous smile on my face, and made me forget of all my other worries for a while. While watching Dreamwork's new masterpiece, How to Train Your Dragon, I couldn't help but think about the similarities between both it and the aforementioned Lilo & Stitch. Toothless, the lead dragon character from the new film resembles the alien Stitch in shape as well as in behavior. Hiccup, the main human character which befriends Toothless despite warnings from his fellow Vikings, is a semi middle-age teenage version of the character Lilo. A trip visit to IMDb cleared things up for me - Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, the same people who directed the 2002 wonder (L & S) are behind the new and awesome How to Train Your Dragon. Fortunately enough, the similarities end here, and this is not a carbon copy of that film - even though the bottom line (tolerance toward people who are different, etc.) is the same. However, this new film takes place in the middle ages, in a small village which is repeatedly attacked by seemingly vicious dragons. Stoick (voiced by the almighty Gerard Butler) is the head of the village, a pumped up manly Viking who leads the counter-attacks against the fierce dragons. His teenage son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), however, doesn't quite fit in. Unlike the older Vikings, who speak in an Irish accent, he sounds like your average American teenager. He's also skinny and small and not exactly the material Viking warriors are made of. After a nightly battle between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup discovers Toothless, a supposedly lethal dragon, which has lost its ability to fly after being injured in the fight. Without anyone knowing, Hiccup slowly gains Toothless' confidence, and the two gradually learn to know each other. After the primal fears disappear, they realize they actually have a great deal to learn about one another \u2013 and that friendship is always better than hostility. Soon enough, Hiccup trains Toothless and learns how to approach dragons in general, something that doesn't quite fit in with his father, friends, and the society he lives in in general. But when a greater threat reveals itself, the Vikings and the dragons discover their only hope is to put aside their prejudice thoughts and fight together \u2013 with Hiccup and Toothless being their best hope for victory. Bottom line \u2013 How to Train Your Dragon is a major victory for the guys at Dreamworks. The film is truly inspiring, with a story that feels self-contained and complete, one that doesn't need to rely on pop culture references to succeed (unlike many of their other products). After a long period of mediocre products (in my opinion) that pale next to their Pixar counterparts, Dreamworks Animation finally came out with the winning formula \u2013 which contains just the right amount of relatable characters and true emotions, stunning visuals (including Nordic landscapes and various species of beautiful dragons) and a 3-D element (that uses InTru technology) that really works for a change. Despite the similarities to Lilo & Stitch, I came out feeling that Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders actually managed to improve on their winning hit, and create the best 2010 release I've seen so far \u2013 and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a long long time.", "I went to the theatre expecting good and I got awesome instead. It was incredible... it totally blew me away. Dreamworks has been improving like crazy since they made Kung Fu Panda (except for those franchises like Shrek, Madagascar, etc. Those are hopeless). The plot is nothing new, it's a formula I've seen before: awkward kid who wants to make it big and get noticed in his little town where he's rejected, falls in love with a girl, screws up, disappoints his father, makes it big by accident, girl falls in love with him, screws up again, people hate him again, saves the world, wins. Take Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Ratatouille for example. But even though it has a trite plot the storytelling is amazing, they pulled it off so well. This movie has one of the best acting scenes I've ever seen. I loved the art direction in general. The renders are truly beautiful. Everything looks very organic. You can actually see hair on people's skin which is really cool, I think I had never seen that before. It's the perfect balance between cartoony and realistic. The character design was very interesting, especially the dragons. They went nuts designing cartoony dragons and giving them particular qualities. The main dragon looks very Stitch-like but he's nothing like Stitch. There are a few characters whose personalities and appearances match perfectly. I loved every single character in that movie, they're all so different and charismatic, even the ones who are supposed to be annoying are very likable. The fact that the dragons can be trained is very plausible. It made me think that men learned to train and/or domesticate wild animals ages ago. We could domesticate wolves that eventually became dogs, we can train tigers, lions, whales, dolphins, bears... so why can't dragons be trained? Think about it... I'm very happy with this movie it made me be proud of being an animator. I have hope in this industry again... It's probably the best 3D animated movie by far. It LITERALLY made me cry tears of awesomeness. I highly recommend it. Watch it....watch it TWICE at least!", "Honestly I went to see this movie thinking \"just another animation that I probably won't pay attention and will sleep in the movie.\"Since my cousin really want to go I had to go with him.In the beginning of the movie nothing happened, I was getting bored and almost sleeping.But when the little kid met his dragon it all turned to be one of the best animation I've ever seen.The skies, the humor and the friendship, the love, and everything in this movie make it worth seeing.Seeing it in 3D will make the things even better, if you are thinking if you should watch it or not, stop thinking and go. I will give it 10 of 10, specially because of the ending.The boy gives the dragon a new part of the tail, how ever in the end the dragon end up being a new part of the boy's leg.", "I just returned form viewing HTTYD on the big screen, in 3-D, and I must say that I was very impressed. Very, very impressed. Loosely based on a series of books by the same name HTTYD comes at you form the beginning and never lets up. Never a dull moment, never a wasted shot or scene the story progresses quickly but not so quick that you get lost. HTTYD harks at the magnificent novel, Eragon which was butchered into a film with the same name. Even if your not a huge dragon/fantasy fan you will be drawn into a story of a boy who fails at everything that is expected of him and knows it, a dragon who acts more like a giant cat, an over ambitious girl, and village full of steel-wielding vikings. The film is also hilarious and filled with one liners that have me laughing even now. The story is simple: a village of stubborn vikings battle dragons to survive until a misfit boy learns secret that could change everything. There are also heart felt moments, hilarious moments and the classic \"OH NO!\" and \"OH YEA!\" moments that are the back bone of any classic movie. This movie is, in some ways like the Incredibles but also in a class of its own. There are some moments that might scare younger viewers, a far amount of violence and some sexual references. I saw it with my family all seven of us, an age range form 45 to 6 and every one loved the movie.  So, go see it on the big screen! Don't wait for DVD and BR release GO NOW you won't regret it! If you can, pay the extra cash and see it in 3-D it worth it! This is the best movie of 2010 so far. GO NOW!", "How to Train Your Dragon is probably the best Dreamworks picture I have ever seen. If you didn't know it was a Dreamworks picture, I wouldn't be surprised if you thought it was a Pixar film. No lies. This movie is almost as good as those amazing Pixar movies out there. First off, let me say that you must watch this movie in 3D. It's not one of those movies that has 3D for the sake of it. It's ACTUALLY a 3D film. The visuals are absolutely stunning and a definite must see in 3D. The plot it self is so beautiful. It's not very predictable and being a teenager, this movie did get to me. This movie is enjoyable for both adults and young kids. Warning: The Dragons may look a little scary to some younger kids. All in all, the visuals are perfect. The plot/dialogue can fool you to thinking the film is Pixar. And in the end, it's an enjoyable movie for all ages!", "Dreamworks Animated movies were usually silly funny, crazy, not serious, heartless and forgettable like \"Monsters vs. Aliens\", \"Shark Tale\". but sometimes there are movies that are great, sometimes serious and memorable like \"Kung Fu Panda\". \"How to train your Dragon\" is one of those great movies. The voice casting was perfect, the animation was awesome, great screenplay and music score. it has a lot of action and exciting scenes. \"How to Train your Dragon\" is the best Dreamworks Animated movie ever. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is better than d' book. The action scenes were awesome, The movie is funny too and the cinematography was amazing. The part when Hiccup was riding on Toothless is better than Jake Sully riding on Banshees from \"AVATAR\". This movie is fun especially in 3D! Gerard Butler was perfect for Stoick the Vast. Jay Baruchel was good. but America Ferrera's performance was bad. This is better than \"AVATAR\" and \"Monsters Vs. Aliens\". \"How to Train your Dragon\" is the best animated movie i watched this year. and this movie gave me goosebumps.", "One of the best films of the year, animated or not. An astounding script, great voices, a beautiful soundtrack, the occasional Norse mythology reference, and great action and scenery. The computers really know how to draw. One thing that bugs me is how dragons fly. Birds have hollow bones and that sort of thing but what of dragons? Their wings do not seem big enough to carry their own weight, much less that of a human rider. But a minor detail to be sure... Great movie. 3-D can help the graphics but even without it, I love it. Amazing family film that all can enjoy complete with slapstick and simple gags. It had better win some awards for awesomeness.", "My eight-year-old nephew and I just got back from seeing How to Train a Dragon 3D at an IMAX. Can we just say WOW, over and over again?! We won't tell you give you all the details because that's already been done in other reviews. Just let us say that we are already talking about going to see it again and also owning the movie as soon as it comes out! It was one of the best movies we've seen in years (and we watch a lot of movies)! The animation is absolutely stunning, but the story is even more wonderful, especially the story lines between the father and Hiccup and Hiccup and the dragons. But the whole story from beginning to end was fascinating and adults and children both will love this movie. We both cried happy tears at the end and still have not stopped talking about how fantastic it is and how much we loved it. We say RUN to your nearest theater to see How to Train a Dragon!", "The plot of the movie is simple enough. Dragons steal animals from the Viking village, Vikings kill the dragons for doing so. Hiccup is cliched opposite of his father. He's more brains than brawn and, of course, his dad is the uber-warrior. They don't see eye to eye. Hiccup is able to injure the most feared but never seen dragon (Night Fury or something). The end up being friends and Hiccup calls him toothless because he has no teeth, except when he does. Hiccup soon finds other methods to subdue dragons that don't require killing them, gaining reputation with the tribe. But he doesn't want to kill a dragon, which his father doesn't like. Skip forward, Hiccups dragon friend is taken and used to find the other dragons, the other dragons are apparently stealing animals to feed an uber-dragon, who is the real bad guy. Big fight scene, true villain is killed, Hiccup is thought to be dead but isn't, dragons and vikings become friends, Hiccup gets a kiss from the girl, everyone lives happily ever after. It's not that the movie is bad. It's entertaining. The dragon flying scenes are great. It's just so formulaic. The first 2/3 of the movie drags because you know exactly where it's going. They could have easily showed more of Hiccup's talent for building things. I had a \"get on with already\" mindset for much of the movie. The third act does get interesting, but the ending is rushed with Hiccup being unconscious for a few days and waking up to dragons and vikings being best of friends. I suppose there there wasn't much to add at that point, but it still felt rushed. 6/10. Kids will love it and, again, it's entertaining. Could have used less cliches.", "The first major film where the agent takes a stake. This is sending shivers through CAA whose power resides in control of the performing talent. The old school agents and the performing talent have distorted the product. This business of animation studios and literary agents is likely to distort things in an equally damaging way. But for now, the shift is visible, welcome and exciting as getout. This is actually written. It grows from within as good writing should rather that seeming like a desired shape made of chicken wire and filled with ordinary bits. Yes, we still have the moralizing because otherwise parents wouldn't think they were parenting. The rendering is cutting edge. But what sets this apart is the use of space. Most folks don't notice this, but we have come a long, long way in five years. I have been following the advances in this. I'll say that if you have not been watching movies in that period, this could make you a bit dizzy because you will not have been walked through the incremental steps in our new spatial imagination. The core quality of cinema is that the filmmaker gets to design your eyes. From the beginning, intelligent filmmakers have experimented with what character the camera might have. This is behind all the filmmakers I believe are great; each added and exploited some new character of eye. With animation, and 3D modeling, it became feasible for the camera to behave in ways that a physical camera could not. Some filmmakers deliberately made their artificial cameras behave like old fashioned ones; perhaps they did not have the skills to move into unusual territory, but I think in most cases the decision was to make the fake world seem real by having the eye treat it as if it were real. Two centers of innovation were WETA (Peter Jackson's shop) and Pixar. Both experimented heaving with vertical motion and depth. Much of this was in flight, sometimes through water. We have precedents, starting with Hell's Angels and slowly working through Star Wars (the original). Then an explosion, and experiments in often overlooked films: King Kong, Treasure Planet, Van Helsing. Now we have the two schools in full bloom. Independently, Dreamworks just couldn't get its groove in animation. Heaven knows they tried to catch up, but they always seemed to be working in space left over from someone else. Here the agent-producer seems to have hired some real spatial talent and let them have control. Even the opening sequence where we see the village and then an attack is spatially thrilling. Luckily, we have two 3D dragonflight movies playing side by side so we can see the two camps compared. Avatar uses WETA and the WETA philosophy. This has the camera as a companion in flight with its own distinct flight path. The excitement is in jumps not in the motion being shown, but the place of the camera. This film adopts the Pixar philosophy which uses POV and POV-inspired notions heaving. In this notion, we are ghosts that can place ourselves anywhere we wish so as to see thing better. We do move, and our eyes do, but motivated by discovery rather than participation. Compare in particular the idea of falling in love as shared, dangerous flight. Thrilling. Simply trilling. We are seeing the birth of a new medium and will dream differently tomorrow. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.", "How to Train Your Dragon may not have a complex plot but its plot with the help of its 3D is engaging enough to keep my eyes glued to the screen. It is also a fun light movie that kids can enjoy. Alice in Wonderland may be a little dark for them. This has some scary/intense scenes with the dragons but it should be fine for the kids as most of the dragons appeal to them. DreamWork movies now are usually 3D and Pixar is following after it. I think DreamWork movies keep improving. I actually find this better than its last movie, Monsters Vs Aliens. The story: Hiccup dreams to kill dragons like Vikings do. He is often ignored by his father when he says he wants to help kill dragons because of his \"weak\" size. When he finally caught a dragon, he gets closer to it and soon, he understands everything he wants to. The plot is straight forward, there is no twist to twist and turn the story. One thing that caught me while watching is the striking John Powell's score. He did an epic score for this which is another factor which contributes to the greatness of this movie. You got cool 3D effects, an enjoyable plot with humour and striking John Powell's score. Overall: It amazes me how much I enjoyed this movie. I never expected much from a DreamWork movie but instead this proves me wrong. I am surprised that this takes little time to dwell on the emotions of the characters and use the remaining time to make a funny action-packed movie. It is a good 3D movie for the kids if you think Tim's Alice In Wonderland is a little too dark.", "Dreamworks Animation films doesn't have the consistency of Pixar. Whereas Pixar's worst films are still \"Very Good\", when Dreamworks films are bad, they are often atrocious. But now and again, they churn out a movie of utter brilliance, that I end up being floored with shock and elation. Films such as Antz (which in fact was better than Pixar's A Bugs Life IMHO), Monster House and Kung Fu Panda spring to mind. So which category does How to Train Your dragon fit in? Well, since my review is very late on this board, amongst unanimously positive reviews, there will be no surprise in guessing that I put this in the utter brilliance category. From start to finish, this movie strikes a great balance of wit, action, drama, and character. This is high calibre entertainment with breathtaking visuals. The protagonist is your usual, unlikely hero, voiced with almost Woody Allenish wit. Though sometimes the voice sounds a little too old for the young animated counterpart but thats a small niggle. This is just quite simply tremendous animated entertainment, fast moving, thrilling and fun. The comedy is sophisticated, devoid of toilet humour, crass jokes. And absolutely no modern popcorn references which I generally hate, which even Pixar is sometimes guilty of. Both kids and adults will love this. Out of Dreamworks output, I rate this above Shrek, on par with Kung Fu Panda and just behind Monster House and Antz.", "I wasn't fortunate enough to watch this movie in 3D, though I wish that I had gotten around to doing it. I bet watching \"How to Train Your Dragon\" in 3D would be downright awesome. I sure enjoyed the movie tremendously in ordinary version. This animated movie was, simply put, fantastic. Next to the \"Final Fantasy\" animated movies and the \"Resident Evil: Degeneration\" animated movie, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is without a doubt the best animated movie I have seen in a long, long time. The story told in \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is very likable and you immediately immerse yourself into the plot, because it is really such a good tale. Lots of adventure and warmth in the story, and it works so well. And the animation itself, wow! Simply fantastic. It looks so very good, lots of amazing details and very colorful. This is the way all animated movies should be, sparkling with colors and life. And the Night Fury dragon had so much character and personality, despite it didn't utter a single comprehensible word throughout the entire movie. I bet you will love him right away, I know I sure did. As for the cast, well voice cast actually, lots of really good names here. I especially enjoyed Gerard Butler in this movie, he has a very good voice that is well suited for voice acting. But also among the impressive cast was America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, and more. Lots of really nice voices to be found here. However, there is one downside to the movie, I am from Denmark, so the vikings are part of my heritage, and people here (and back then) didn't speak English with a Scottish accent. That, and that alone, was the only drawback of the movie. But it is a minor detail, and I looked past that. And as in going with the Scottish accent, why didn't Hiccup speak with that particular accent? And no offense to Jay Baruchel, but there is just something very annoying about his nasal voice. It just doesn't go well with me. But moving on, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is definitely a movie that you just have got to watch in any way you can. This movie is amazing, and that is the end of that! Thumb up, way, way up for this masterpiece. It has entertainment value for children and adults alike.", "I have recently got obsessed with How to Train Your Dragon. Why you might ask? Well because it is the most fantastic, amazing, brilliant movie I have ever seen. Why? Well first of all the music is perfect, always capturing the moment perfectly. Second, the story it just amazing. I don't want to give anything away, so just watch and you will see why. Third, the voice acting is fantastic. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup the main character, and America Ferrera voices the love interest Astrid. Jay Baruchel does a perfect job at voicing Hiccup because he is just like Hiccup in many ways. Forth and final reason why this movie is fantastic, amazing, and brilliant is that the visuals are amazing. The animation looks nothing like you have seen before. You can see every little freckle on Hiccup's face, even a scar or two. Most people would think of How to Train Your Dragon as a children's movie. Well I don't think so and Dreamworks doesn't either. Dreamworks has said many times it is not intended to be only a children's movie, but more of a teen and adult flick too. You will notice if you ask a kid about this movie they do not remember it that well. Why, because they have seen so many other movies that just stuck more because of how childlike they were. Most of the fans are teens and adults, but that doesn't mean kids would't like it, just that teens and adults will appreciate it a lot more. This movie deserves a 10 out of 10, and I say buy it! If you have a 3D TV watch in 3D because the 3D also looks fantastic. Dreamworks made the best animated movie ever! It will forever be remembered and is a classic that everyone should see.", "I can't even begin to talk about why I love this film so much. For starters, the voice casting is amazing. Jay Baruchel is a great protagonist, America Ferrera is a wonderful female lead/love interest. People like Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas) and Craig Ferguson (as Craig Ferguson) play off each other so well, and the other teens (T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, etc.) were good supporting characters. Second, it's a rich and fantastic story. I only found out a few days ago that this was based on a book, and while I haven't read it yet, I'm definitely going to. There are too many funny scenes to list, but I really love all the interactions with Toothless and Astrid. It's the little things like his eyebrows that get me. I really /really/ hope that they choose a better name for the sequel though.", "And I loved Ratatouille and WALL-E. This is the best animated movie of of them all. I am a \"senior citizen\", who, of course, grew up with Disney animated movies. Loved animated movies then and still love them now - especially when they are as good as this. It first came to my attention in 2009 when I started reading blogs that jerry Butler was doing the voice over for this movie with the interesting title. I am a HUGE jerry butler fan, but despite that, I still missed it at the theater. Then I saw it on HBO and HAD to get the Blu-Ray DVD for our HD TV. Best thing I ever did. Movie is beautifully put together, all the way around - animation, script and character's voices. Great Cast - right down to the smallest character. Craig Fergeson was a surprise - I love him, too - and almost upstages Jerry Butler. But the best characters of the movie are Hiccup and Toothless, the dragon who is more a cross between a playful, lovable pet black panther and a stealth bomber than the scary villains dragons are supposed to be. The flying scenes are awesome and the interaction, understanding, tolerance and deep friendship that develops between Hiccup and Toothless (especially at the end) is the best part of the story. I have watched it at least 20-25 times, still enjoy it each time and still laugh at the one-liners. I actually have my favorites that I laugh out load at each time! It is quite an enchanting and enjoyable movie for \"kids\" of all age. Rent or buy this movie in Blu-Ray. You won't be sorry. Bravo Dreamworks! Would love a well-written sequel with all these great characters.", "Based on a novel with the same name, writer William Davies was able to turn this kids story into a touching and deep first-class screenplay that is really rare for Dream Works. Hiccup, voiced by the devastating and believable Jay Baruchel, is a weak and low self-esteem little boy who lives in a world of Vikings. His dad and his friends, all around him, their life mission is to kill dragons and Hiccup is expected to do the same. Going through training and a lot of trying, Hiccup was not successful. Instead of killing dragons, Hiccup decided to read books on the dragons and found out they are not that bad. The belief was brought on after Hiccup met a dragon, who was considered the most dangerous dragon and did not try to eat him. This created a interesting but predictable twist for the audience to eat up on. Hiccup named his \"friend\" Toothless. Months go by as Hiccup trains his dragon friend Toothless to fly since he was injured when Hiccup found him. Throughout the training, their relationship begins to build and we see that Hiccup is falling in love. The writer really wanted us to cry at this point because Hiccup's friend Toothless was discovered by the town people and he's being killed by them. At the end, we know that dragons aren't as bad and Vikings shouldn't be killing them. This really looks like Disney's work because the message and the tone of the film is based on being friends and nice and all. At first, I thought this was not Dream Work's work, but after checking up on it, I was surprised. This looked more like Disney's cheesy work than Dream Work's. How To Train Your Dragon is classy, funny, kid-friendly, and intelligently scripted. It is one of the best films of the year. OscarBuzz: Best Animated Feature, this will go head to head against Toy Story 3. Even though Toy Story 3 definitely has a lead, if it didn't win, How To Train Your Dragon would snatch the Oscar.", "This is a DreamWorks film? Wow, impressive. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a real shocker, it's a film that was made by DreamWorks Animation but it didn't really feel like a DreamWorks animated film. It felt like it was more in line with a good Disney film or any of Pixar's films. I've always had my doubts about DreamWorks after \"Shrek 2\", as they began sinking into a formula that is now annoying and irritating. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a refreshing effort that tries its hardest to break free from the formula. Based on Cressida Cowell's children's book of the same name, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a satisfying action-adventure that mostly fires on all cylinders. The characters are likable, and you can root for them, unlike most DreamWorks films where the characters are obnoxious or annoying. The dragon, Toothless, is easily the best character despite being a non-speaking character. Like the most appealing animated characters, he's instantly likable. Hiccup and Toothless' friendship is believable and not contrived. It's a winning effort. Aside from the storytelling, the animation was really good. The art direction and character animation were fabulous, more in line with Pixar's visuals than anything else DreamWorks has done. Prior to \"Dragon\", DreamWorks' films were questionable in terms of character animation. \"Dragon\"'s art direction is great, from high seas to detailed forests to the elusive dragons' nest. The crew working on this film knocked themselves out, and it puts everything else from DreamWorks (with the slight exceptions of \"Shrek\" and some of their traditional hand-drawn efforts) to shame. The screenplay wasn't great, but it was certainly much better than the obnoxious DreamWorks films before it. It's not constant pop culture jokes and toilet humor being shot at you. However, the writing was still a little weak because of the modern-slang slant to it. Otherwise, it was not cringe-worthy or anything. I also thought that some of the dramatic moments were a little downplayed, but it was nice to see moments like that in a DW film. The film was also devoid of using some pop song in the middle of the film. So DreamWorks scored a near-home run. It feels more sincere than the other films, it isn't the usual sitcom-dialogue, pop culture joke-laden romp from DreamWorks. It was a fine adventure story with some knock-out moments and easily DreamWorks' most appealing creation, Toothless. Maybe it was great because Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois directed it, being the two behind Disney's \"Lilo & Stitch\", and of course Toothless somewhat resembles Stitch and Sanders' drawing style. A real winner. Highly recommended. 8.5 out of 10.", "With the whole 3D movie craze finally becoming a normal thing, movies need to push themselves in order to \"stand out\" more than the others. How to Train Your Dragon is the latest entry into the new dimension of films. I'm starting to get annoyed by the whole 3D cash-in scheme, but this film was worth my time and money. This film boasted terrific animation, some great voice work, but the story of the town outcast appears in every kids movie, so the plot suffered a bit. There is enough humour in this film to entertain both kids and adults, thanks to some entertaining characters (some of the dragon designs are fantastic, their emotions are believable!). How to Train Your Dragon is well recommended.", "Where can I begin a review when I have so much to say about this movie? Without giving anything away from the plot it is brilliant. for children it opens up a land of magic and wonder. For adults it is a breath taking experience full of love, struggle, and hardship that draws you in and never lets you go. The characters in this movie were amazing and its what really made it come together. I actually cared about them and what happened to them. and became worried when any one of them were in Danger especially at the end. The love between the main character and his dragon is especially a wonderful experience you can feel the emotion the dragon and the main character have for each other. It made me go out and bring my dogs inside for the night. It also showcases the struggle families sometimes experience you can just see how badly the main character wants his father to be proud of him. And how much the father wishes to protect his son as well as relate to him. You can feel there care and love for each other even when things are at there worst. But it never goes overboard with love as so many movies do now a days it shows us that life can be a struggle and full of dangers and hardship but we are never alone and must never give up. The dialogue of the movie is spot on and I believed I would say the same thing in many of the situations the animation was perfect in all aspects. Sound/Atmosphere Both are incredible the sound seems to be right on cue and is perfect from beginning to end it fits every single scene. The Surronding land is breath taking it filled me with ideas and really made me want to be there. Bottom line This movie is a masterpiece and a must see. It helped me get over my writers block and gave me back the emotion I needed to continue my story and refueled my imagination. It is better then any animated film I have ever seen in my life as well as many non-animated films. I want to scream for a sequel but I think it would be better to leave this film be and let our imaginations make our own sequel. The only downside to this film is when it ended. Because I would give anything for it to be real.", "How To Train Your Dragon is the latest offering Dreamworks has released but could this be as big or as bold as Shrek? The story is very imaginative and is guaranteed to keep the attention of children and adults. The characters were lovable and the dragons were simply adorable, especially Toothless. The animation was marvellous and doesn't disappoint in quality which was to be expected from Dreamworks. The script is very cleverly written like everything else in the movie. Great characters, good music, brilliant animation and fantastic humour, this doesn't disappoint. I simply fell in love with this movie. I loved Shrek and Kung Fu Panda but this beats them in my opinion. The animation was simply crafted beautifully and you could tell that a lot of time and effort had gone into it and is probably the best animation I've seen for years in a kids' movie. I also liked how the dragons didn't talk, I thought it added a sense of reality to the movie (even if there is dragons in it). This doesn't mean Toothless, the main dragon, is boring, far from it. Toothless and Hiccup was fantastic as their trust and friendship made for heart-felt viewing and some funny scenes. The best scenes, in my opinion, was the flying scenes with Toothless and Hiccup, the animation during them scenes were phenomenal to watch. The characters were great as well and Hiccup's crush Astrid was great as she tries to figure out what Hiccup is up to. Overall, the movie had fantastic scenes, beautiful animation, great characters, voice acting, script and story\u0085what more could you possibly want from an animation? I highly recommend everyone to watch this, this is one not to miss!

What else can you ask for? The story starts off with a short narrative from the main character, Hiccup (what an interesting name), who introduces the setting quite clearly and obviously. Good. I don't like to be confused with where I'm going with a movie.  There are many nice special effects and beautiful artwork - the humans are realistic enough and the dragons look very original. Story development is well-paced and seems to follow through with a climax and conclusion. The ending was satisfying. I mean, it wasn't as unrealistic as to have everybody come out alive and jumping around, but it wasn't so tragic that all the babies in the theatre would start crying. And, it wrapped up nicely without leaving any obvious gaps.  Characters were stereotypical and easy to understand. I wished there was more character development of the sidekick kids such as Astrid and Snoutlout. It would have been interesting to know a bit more about them. I also wish there was a story behind Hiccup's mother. Music was nice, charming and sound effects really hit the spot. The dragon noises were realistic, and Toothless' was so adorable! My favourite part of the movie was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. When I saw that dragon on posters and in trailers, I was horrified to see that its face was non-scary and even a little bit salamander-like. However Toothless is actually very very adorable and cute! I like the emphasis on themes such as friendship among species, father to son relationships, justice, being different, and many others. Overall, this movie will thrill both the young and the old alike. In addition, How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent movie for people who are looking for a good dragon-themed movie! Yay! (No more vampires!) 9.5/10", "The right combination of an appropriately awkward protagonist, a clever script with not a single pop culture reference, and truly remarkable animation (including 3-d flying scenes that trump anything in Avatar), made this flick a blast from start to finish.  A group of Scottish(??) Vikings live on a small island, stubbornly rebuilding their wooden homes after they are burned to the ground by the islands other inhabitants: dragons of myriad shapes and sizes that steal their sheep and raze their village. Over and over again. Beefcake adults with proved mettle act as dragon slayers, fighting off the scourge. The young, gangly Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) aspires, in his way, to join their ranks and prove himself to his father and Chief, Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). Short of brawn but heavy on brains, Hiccup invents a catapult type device, which he uses to bring down the legendary Night Fury, a dragon so notoriously fast and deadly that they've never even been seen with the naked eye.  When he finds the fallen dragon, injured and helpless in the tangles of his trap, Hiccup cannot bring himself to slay it and instead sets it free, thus starting one of the most endearing \"boy and his pet\" relationships in movie history. That night, two hearts change - Hiccup decides he doesn't want to become a slayer, while Stoick decides Hiccup deserves a chance. His father's will too strong, Hiccup reluctantly begins slayer training, where he will learn to bring down - and kill - the beasts.  The story is simple and straightforward; a zero-to-hero tale with few surprises (think Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Disney's Hercules, or the on-the-nose straight to video sequel Hercules: Zero to Hero). But the strength of the characters, humour of the script, and more importantly the remarkable execution of flying and dragon vs. dragon fight scenes make the film enjoyable throughout. Hiccup is an endearing protagonist, appealing to teen awkwardness and a desire for acceptance from both peers and family. The supporting cast is a good mix of headstrong and suitably jerky-come-friendly teenagers, while Stoick, as his name might suggest, is a strong but distant patriarch, making for one of the funniest \"good talk\" scenes between father and son.  The dragons are by far the best part of the film, which offers up a half-dozen or so of uniquely characterized beasts, including a two headed menace with one head that spews gas and another that acts as pilot light, and a giant spindly red dragon that tends to set itself on fire. Hiccup's pet dragon, dubbed Toothless (for his retractable razor sharp teeth), is clearly modeled after your dog (and everyone else's) and his puppy-like naivet\u00e9 trapped in a sleek, pebbled, 30 foot frame will strike a chord with all pet owners. Oh, and he's also a major bad-ass black dragon that you can ride and he has laser-precise blue fireball action and is capable of speeds likely measured in \"Mach\"s and you want one. The flying scenes in this film are captivating and fun and represent some of the most engaging use of 3D technology I've seen.  How to Train Your Dragon is pure vicarious wish fulfillment, watering a seed planted in older viewers by The Never Ending Story, and likely planting one in younger viewers too young to remember Atreyu and Falkor. Endearing, enchanting, and engaging, a fun movie for anyone who ever wanted to ride a dragon. 8/10", "I just don't know how to say about this movie! This is absolutely the best animated feature of the year! The plot, characters, visual effects are so amazing. The plot was simple and not complicated. But very touching, indeed. Dragons rarely seen on cartoon, today. But this one did a great job on creating a world where Vikings vs Dragons and making people moved by the relationship of the characters. The characters were well-made and beautiful, I love not only their appearance but also...themselves. Especially the dragons, they are very cute, indeed. They make me wish I could ride dragons one day. I'm definitely sure that this movie will make you wish it would been longer. You'll want to see more! And I hope they will make a sequel, but this original is so great that I can watch it again and again. Last but not least, I hope this film will get some Oscar nominees and win! Go watch it and you see. Enjoy your watching.", "Right from the start this one is a winner. The new Dreamwork animation is a happy-go-lucky kind of animation with a serious story to it. The makers never took themselves seriously or lightly, they were somewhere in the in-between (:P) and that is where their victory lies. Getting down to the story\u0085 A Viking Tribe lives close to the seas and what do they have to worry about in their calm lives \u2013 DRAGONS. And the stubborn vikings fight, fight, fight but with no end result. And among these there is ,Hiccup, the only child of the chief of the tribe who is different. He is not strong as the others neither does he have good Viking skills. But one fine day he shoots down one dragon by luck. He traces it down and it is one of those dragons that is considered to be the most dangerous by the tribe. There are strict orders to kill it on sight. But the little kiddo never had it in him to do that. He cuts it loose and then the bondage starts between them. And the rest of the story is about how the kiddo and the dragon change the path of the lives and minds of the the tribe. This is by far, the best movie of the year. The animation is stunning. Some of the wide angle shots and sweep shots are brilliant and the detail is also amazing. Action sequences are another treat. It is a goose-bumping experience. And the story is also good as it tugs at the strings right at the bottom of the heart. And there is lot to laugh as well. Brilliant one-liners that go well with the movie. \"Death by the Dragon, is an occupational hazard here\"\u0085.something on that line. The voices by Jay Baruchel and Jonal Hill were good. And believe me, some scenes brought me to tears, some scenes had me jumping out of seat out of excitement. No wonder, the animation won the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award. And Pixar can learn some valuable lessons from this animation. All in all, this is great and a must watch. 9/10", "I've said it before but I'll say it again here and that is that it is unfair of Dreamworks to have to compete with the consistently high quality of Pixar films \u2013 films that deliver so strongly on so many aspects across the board. I say this because I did really enjoy HTTYD but still found myself wondering how much more character, emotion and comedy Pixar would have brought to the same story. This is unfair of me but yet I cannot help it. HTTYD is a great little tale where a Viking boy learns about the enemy (the dragon) and finds that perhaps everything he has been taught about them is a lie or, at best, one big misunderstanding. The moral of the film is pretty clear as is the general direction of the narrative. This doesn't stop it being engaging and entertaining though because it is. The story plays out well and is funny and had me interested and caring throughout, while the characters were solid. Problem is that all of it is good \u2013 but yet none of it excels. So on the characters: they are all solid and do what is required but none really absorbed me to the point I forget they were cartoon creations voiced by actors. Likewise the comedy, it was consistently amusing and had a few nice touches here and there but the side characters didn't provide the depth or comedic value that Pixar so often manages to do with their equivalents. But it is still good stuff though and children will love it while adults will find it easy to enjoy \u2013 I watched with no children and only another adult in their 30's and none of it came over as \"below us\" or aimed at children with no appeal to us \u2013 which, for all my critical comparison, is a hard thing to achieve but this did it well. The animation is very good of course but in particular they have done the action sequences very well, making them exciting and intense without being hard to follow or see what is happening. The voice cast are mostly OK but they do all suffer from the inability to make their characters real. Baruchel is solid enough in the lead but not great. Likewise Butler turns in another \"meh\" performance for me but at least here his Scottish brogue helps him and his lack of screen charisma doesn't hurt his voice work. Ferguson is a better piece of casting as his voice is fun and he seems to have a natural humour about him \u2013 I don't like his show myself but he did work well here. Beyond them there isn't the dept I would have liked. Hill was so-so, Likewsie Ferrara and Mintz-Plasse \u2013 although none of them really impress me too much in other films so no surprise that they don't here either. Solid work by all, but nobody really hit it out of the park. Overall HTTYD is an enjoyable and entertaining family film that delivers comedy, a good story and thrills to good effect. It doesn't excel in any specific area when viewed on an open field though but, while watching it the film keeps you involved enough so that the comparisons to Pixar occur after, not during the film.", "How To Train Your Dragon was a very surprising delight. I certainly did not expect a film of this high caliber. The story and the characters are strong, the direction graceful, and the animation beautiful. It is an animated film that goes back to the classic animated films where, while the animation is enough to get people excited, it's writing is what grabs your heart and never lets go. The voice-overs are great, and the two main characters, Hiccup and Toothless, are probably the most thoughtful and moving animated characters since the duo in WALL-E. And in this time, where most of the films in 3-D really do not need it, the 3-D in this actually boots your excitement level and enhances you into the story a lot more. I think as far as 3-D in animation goes, this is the best I have ever seen. The music score is also amazing, and I loved listening to it, especially in the subtle scenes between Toothless the Dragon and Hiccup bonding. It has been a long time since Dreamworks has come out with a really great film, especially an animated one, but this is finally it! It surprised me, not only because it is Dreamworks, but because it is March and not the time of year to release a film like this. But BRAVO!", "After squirming through some real losers like \"Bee Movie\", this is the most enjoyable children's film I've seen in several years. I watched it with my 5 yr-old grandson and both of us were equally engaged and entertained from start to finish. That's quite a stretch and no small task for today's audiences. I went to the cinema expecting to snooze through some sappy \"boy meets dragon\" Lassie tale. But the story is astutely pulled together with sophistication, sensitivity, and a lot of excitement. Why this movie succeeds:  1. The main characters are endearing and simply don't come with any saccharine cutesiness. Jay Baruchel captures the character of \"Hiccup\" with a wit and style that doesn't pander to youngsters or is otherwise gratuitous. 2. The dragon \"Toothless\" thankfully doesn't talk, sing, or act like a human covered in scales. It doesn't exude some sappy puppy dog love. Nor pop philosophy, which made the film \"Dragon Heart\" mawkish. Toothless simply acts as an intelligent creature that communicates though an enchanting range of expressions. 3. The film has one nicely simply yet deep message for kids: treat all forms of life with respect, kindness and empathy. The film doesn't try to monotonously cram some New Age or politically correct rhetoric down your throat, as \"Wall-E\" did. 4. The editing and pacing is superb. There is never a dull moment. The film zooms along with nonstop action, adventure, fun and dry wit. It is visually stunning in 3D. Don't wait for the DVD.", "The trailer of this movie was so unpromising and unattractive. It did not make me want to watch this, in 3D no less. However, my kids all wanted to watch it, so of course, my wife and I had to go with them. The first one-fourth of the movie was very static and slow for me, all talk. I felt very sleepy and was in fact, drifting off. I did not really immediately like the appearance of the kids, which I found generally annoying. However, when time came that our hero (with the improbable name of Hiccup) met his cute dragon pal (with the equally improbable name of Toothless), the movie picked up pace and from there, it never looked back. The next three fourths of the film was alive with beautiful 3D animation and very heartfelt and touching writing. I know we have all seen flying dragons before (like in \"Shrek\"), but the additional animated depth and the fantastic background scenery gave this one a breath-taking quality that made it distinct. The very meticulous and larger-than life scenes of the Viking armada at sea, the Vikings running from the exploding mountain, and especially the final climactic battle, were truly in a class of their own. That is saying a lot in these times when 3D animation seems to be the standard already, and not the exception. The story of the rough tough father and his weakling son has been played in out in various ways in so many various movies before. But somehow, the way it is played out here still managed to be effective in drawing out genuine emotions. The straightforward storyline and familiar conflicts were successfully brought to a higher level by the original vision and masterful direction of Dean de Blois and Chris Sanders (of \"Lilo and Stitch\"). This is a shoo-in for one of the nominee slots in the Best Animated Feature Oscar for the coming year.", "O.K. Here is the deal. I am a normal guy. I watch football. I run marathons sometimes. I fix my car. I only intended to glance at this movie to see if it would be appropriate for my five-year-old. I ended up staying for the whole movie. During the flying scenes, with the perfectly-suited Galic music cheering us on in the background, I had tears of purest joy streaming down my face from the, raw, visceral emotion of it. I thought of Gerard Manley Hopkins and the Windhover: \"The dapple-dawn-drawn falcon in his riding .../.. High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing\" Perfect movie making. I have to say, I've seen nothing like these scenes, and I cry at movies every, I dunno, twenty years or so?  Let's be clear: this is an animated movie for kids. The story is straightforward, at the level that, yes, my five-year-old will understand. The music is very good. The story-animation is so well done that it just falls into the background as the story unfolds. It is not \"artful\" in the way of, say, Miyazaki, but it is still wildly creative and yields a magical world of ocean, rugged northern lands, and forest. The animation of the physics of flight and motion, and the details of emotional expression are exceptional. The voice actors are interesting, and without the sappy voices, and contrived humor we have found in some other recent animated movies. There is no pretense here of the movie trying to be something it is not. There are inconsistencies in the accents, and holes in the plot if you care to look. But, and this is the important but, the story, and especially the *experience* of this movie transcends both the genre and its shortcomings. Even if it is just for the highlights as one is soaring above ocean and earth on the back of a dragon, this is a movie for way more than just kids. At the end of the movie, most everyone cheered, and half stood up and cheered, which I also have not seen before. I recommend this movie as genre art that is exceptionally well done, an uplifting evening's entertainment. You MUST see it in 3D! Yaaaaayyyy! Who-hoooh!", "In an age where 3D technology is becoming the primary appendage to \"hook\" audiences in, it's refreshing to watch a film that uses it more as an accessory than the main attraction (*cough* Avatar *cough*). Directed by Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders (Lilo & Stitch) the film is set around a Viking village on the island of Berk that is periodically raided by dragons that steal from their flock of sheep. The film follows the adventures of Hiccup, a scrawny, awkward and socially outcast Viking boy who aspires to follow the tradition of his tribe in becoming a dragon-slayer, only to discover that he does not share his fellow Vikings' brutish nature.  The film itself is visually stunning with beautifully drawn landscapes and characters. The dragons are especially well crafted, ranging from a fire-breathing monster to a comical flying blowfish. Although I was sceptical at first, the 3D elements were also a nice touch. It made the island of Berk a little more immersive, without overshadowing the film completely. However, where the film really shines is in its musical score, which is brilliantly composed and enhances the emotion of every scene it is used in.  Like any film, however, How to train your Dragon has its flaws. It heavily relies on slapstick humour which, although funny at first, quickly got stale. The first 20 minutes were particularly weak, to the point where after the characters were introduced the humour became extremely lacklustre and the entire plot seemed to stall for a good 5 minutes or so. Also, without giving too much away, the central message of the film is basically thrown out the window during the climax which made the film seem like a slightly shallow experience as I left the cinema.  Despite the critique, How to train your Dragon was a fun film. No, it's no Pixar's Up, but it makes for a fun, heart-warming and light-hearted hour and 20 minutes. Check it out.", "I did not have much expectation when i went for this movie. Once it started, i knew i am gonna like it. The story is kinda different and i loved the animation, texturing and cinematography. Though the movie was just 1hr 30mins, felt long enough and story was complete and nothing untold. Set in the mythical world of Vikings and Dragons, tell the story of Hiccup who actually does n fit much with his tribe who are dragon slayers. His world changes wen he meets a dragon which ends up his tribe people to see everything in a different point of view. Dream-works did n disappoint us !! And how can i forget about the Stereoscopic Dreamworks Logo !!! awesome So .. Don miss it !!!!!!", "How to train your dragon is another good animation provided by DreamWorks where the main character is a viking boy named Hiccup who is more like the kid-with-brain than the kid-with-muscles. He always wanted to prove himself worthy in battling real dragons but life decided for him that he will prove worthy to himself by understanding those creatures. He somehow manages by luck to hurt and \"catch\" the \"Night Fury\", the dragon everyone wanted to catch, but instead of killing him he finds his own fear and loneliness into Fury's eyes, making him to spare his life. From that point the story goes on and is delivered quite well for this type of movies though I have some complains about continuity or even logic but I'll keep those to myself. What I did not like about this was the voices. And when I say the voices I don't mean that they didn't act well but one question hit me from the beginning: Why all those different English accents in the same actual group? You got irish, Scottish and American accents which makes no actual sense. But I guess that was the fault of the casting team. Anyway besides that everything seemed pretty original and entertaining. The characters were not that great developed I mean it was the usual stuff but I won't be \"trolling\" to call them clich\u00e9s. The dialogue suffered here and there and some action-scenes especially when Hiccup was training were ridiculous like when the dragon chased all of them in that ring, Hiccup was very relaxed and kept on asking Gobber things about the \"Night Fury\" which was kind of you know.. lame... because who would do that even if you're a nerd you're still scared or at least concerned about the dragon that chases you... Besides this the movie was edited well, same goes for the cinematography, music was good but nothing tremendous and the 3D was really great as far as the effects and all... but with all these the movie missed something for me... 8.3 on IMDb almost the equal of \"Up\" or Wall E... I mean... this is one overrated movie... It's good for kids, families and all of that but not that good that anyone could find it appealing because it doesn't develop any real emotions at all... feeling sorry for your father's wishes as for your destiny, finding the good in what people saw bad, the girl who's indifference changed into interest for you and all that are clich\u00e9s and they are used in so many animation movies that I can't give this one propz even if it's entertaining and fun to watch. And talking about characters and dialogue, it was pretty cheesy at moments, few major jokes and few characters that you would remember after leaving the theaters like people still remember the pigeons from Bolt or the Hamster... because they were ridiculously funny... here? I did not get that feeling... As far as the score I didn't actually felt it... It was good I guess it fitted the movie's personality but it was no near Up, Wall E or Coraline... to mention some animations from the last 2 years... Movie is well executed, but it seriously has it's ups and downs and it's downs should count more since it's so overrated...", "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is an animated feature film from five years ago that was nominated for two Academy Awards. It lost Score to \"The Social Network\" and \"Animated Feature\" to \"Toy Story 3\". Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders directed this film and they were also 2 of the 4 people who adapted Cressida Cowell's book so successfully for the big screen. A second film followed and also a television series plus several short films that were mostly added as DVD material. I will not go a lot into detail about who the voice actors here are. You can check that in the list of cast and credits. The movie runs for slightly under 90 minutes not counting the credits and thus it is a bit shorter than the sequel, but not by much. There is one main antagonist in this film: a gigantic dragon. To me, movies usually stand and fall with how interesting this main antagonist is. And I have to say that I did not find him too interesting. The reason is probably that we do not find out too much about him really. Apparently, he threatens all the other smaller dragons and forces them to bring him tons of food on a regular basis. This is why the dragons only steal from the humans in order to secure their own survival. This explanation is a major plot point of the film in order to explain how humans and dragon coexist peacefully at the end after centuries of fighting. The main character is Hiccup, a boy who just does not seem to have it inside of him to fight dragons. After a fateful meeting with a black Night Fury dragon, the two become friends and their relationship is put to the test. Same goes for the boy's relationship with his father, which is one of the emotional core points of the film. I said earlier that I was not too fond of the main antagonist. This is, however, not a major problem here as the movie is much more about humans and dragons bonding than about defeating the beast. There are some very beautiful scenes in this film. I thought Toothless, the Night Fury, was animated greatly. I loved his face expressions when he interacts with Hiccup all the time. I also really loved the flying scene with Astrid and Hiccup on Toothless. A thing of beauty and certainly this scene alone is worth watching the film on the big screen. But there are more of course. Yes, there are also a couple slightly cringeworthy moments like Hiccup becoming too heroic and a couple really untrained kids on small untrained dragons defeating the big monster, but oh well. Dragons are fantasy creatures anyway, so we should not expect too much realism in here. It's sometimes tough to remember that, but if you do, you will be rewarded. As a whole, I enjoyed this film. Certainly among the best animated films from 2010, even if I have to admit I liked \"Toy Story 3\" still a bit more. So I am with the Academy on this one. And I also actually liked the sequel to HTTYD even more than this one, especially because of its emotional impact. This is one area, during which this film here sometimes comes a bit short. Nonetheless, it was a pretty good watch and overall, I recommend \"How to Train Your Dragon\". Definitely worth checking out. Maybe if you are unsure, watch an episode of the television series first or a short film and decide then, but I am positive that you will not be disappointed. Thumbs up.", "When i first saw this film at the cinema i thought it had no heart and was quite shallow. The thing that annoyed me was that this son of the chief spoke in an American accent when everyone else (apart from some teens) spoke in a Scottish accent, they all should have had one type of accent. But after watching it a second time i saw the heart of the story and the emotion between Toothless and Hiccup. It is very uplifting and so enjoyable to watch. I live Toothless, he's just plain cool and cute, i want a dragon like that one!!! But i think the journey Hiccup takes is extraordinary and its great to see how he grows in confidence but still remains the down to earth kid that we see at the beginning and he doesn't loose that quality through the film. It had humorous moments in with some of the characters which kept the spirit up in this film. The ending is very uplifting and i wonder how they are going to follow on with a sequel which is planned to be released in 2013. The CGI is amazing, it's so polished and modern and it feels fresh. I do think that if you don't like this film at first, at least watch it again and you'll love it soon enough, i'm sure of it. DreamWorks have hit a goldmine with this one.", "One of the best animated movies I have ever seen.. I can easily compare this with any of the top animated movies out there including monsters inc., UP, Wall-e, kungfu panda and cloudy with chances of meatballs.. It reminds me a portion of avatar in which there was a dragon taming scene.. Character development was extremely strong with a strong focus on script and storyline.. Graphics are pretty much amazing and credit goes to dreamworks for maintaining their top of class animation. I won't go into details, but after cloudy with chances of meatballs, this is the latest animated movie that not only amazes me, but also keeps my 2 and 3 year sons to stick to the seat until the movie ends..", "I'm beginning to think that the people who make CGI features have got it pegged a lot better than those who make live action movies. So often they seem to have a good story, an excellent script, cracking characterisation, and fabulous visuals. How To Train Your Dragon is no exception. Hiccup is the son of Viking chief Stoick, whose village is beset by dragons which steal the livestock. Hiccup is a disappointment to his father, especially when he doesn't take the same warlike approach to dragon-slaying classes as his contemporaries. But then Hiccup begins to be able to deal with the dragons better than the other youngsters, because he has secretly befriended an injured dragon. This is an outcast story, dealing with a youngster who is alienated, but has the strength of character to stick to his guns in the face of pressure from all sides to conform. But it is also an exciting adventure story with a great deal of humour. The characters are engaging and well-drawn (in the dramatic sense, although they also look good). And the movie looks great. The locations are stunning, the animation is first rate, and 3D is very well used (focus pulls, in particular, work very well in 3D). And, more than anything else, there were big, big chunks of this film where it just got hold of me almost physically (and certainly emotionally) and took me on Hiccup's journey with him. Possibly a little intense for younger children, this is a great family film. I loved it.", "First off, did you like Shrek? Finding Nemo? If you like an animated movie with a wonderful story that delves into character development, then How to Train Your Dragon is for you. How to Train Your Dragon is the best family animated film I have seen in a long, long time. The characters are wonderfully written. We see the friendship between Hiccup (the main character) and Toothless (the dragon) develop through their awkwardness, fear of each other (at first) and their attempts to understand one another. We see the story of a young viking who does not fit in being able to use his other gifts to become a viable part of his society. The film is well written overall. It has some of the standards outcast type situations, but those are the things that make outcast movies so endearing. The film looks marvelous. How to Train Your Dragon uses the 3D element very well and creates a beautiful world for the story to grow within. Highly recommended.", "How To Train Your Dragon (Imax, 3-D, 1:38, PG) \u2014 Other: Adventure, 2nd string, original It's taken a quarter of a year for 2010 to produce an SF&F movie that I can honestly recommend, but it is my pleasure to be able to do so for How To Train Your Dragon, an Imax 3-D offering from DreamWorks Animation. It's by the same creative team that did Lilo & Stitch, and the 1st sight of the eponymous dragon should give you a frisson of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu if you saw that little delight back in 2002. The story opens with a voice-over narration from a character we will soon meet, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), son of Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, and that's pronounced \"stoic\", not \"stoyk\"), leader of a viking village that's beset with what Hiccup understatedly calls a pest problem. As he mentions this, 1 of the 2 sheep contentedly grazing before us suddenly gets snatched away by a barely seen dark shape from above. Yes, it turns out that the \"pests\" are dragons. The village has been there for 7 generations, but Hiccup notes that all the houses are brand new, and we shortly see why, as flaming dragon breath takes out several of them. Still, the tribe soldiers on. \"We're vikings\", Hiccup tells us. \"We have stubbornness issues.\" We finally see Hiccup himself, a toothpick of a lad, being chivvied by his hugely burly elders into the cover of the town smithy, where he's apprenticed to Gobber (Craig Ferguson). Hiccup is in his early teens and wants to prove himself a fighter, but it's quickly apparent that he's more adept at draftsmanship, creative thinking, and gadgetry. (I also note, with some pride, that he's a fellow left-hander.) He's rigged up a net-casting trebuchet, and he thinks he's winged one of the overflying dragons, but it didn't fall anywhere near the village, and without the corpus delicti everyone razzes him about his claim to have bagged a rare Night Fury breed \u2014 the kind that's never seen ... and never misses. The foregoing is about the 1st 7 minutes of the movie, and the rest is equally densely packed. I'm not going to go into any more detail, because there are several twists and turns that you really need to see to appreciate. However, given the film's title, it's hardly giving anything away to mention that Hiccup sets out the following day to look for his downed dragon and discovers him very much alive but hobbled, trapped in a rock-walled glen, and desperate for succor. He's been told \"A dragon will always, always go for the kill!\" \"So why didn't you?\" he muses, as he hauls a load of fish to his new-found friend. We discover that there are many different kinds of dragons, from the bloated, buffoonish Grundle that serves as the Read Me file for the dragon-fighting trainees up to the Monstrous Nightmare, only a notch below the Night Fury in awesomeness. They are all wonderfully rendered in their splendid variety, just a visual treat. Nor does the eyefeast end there. This is a gorgeous movie, resplendent with color and natural beauty. Billowing cloudscapes and scenes of flight into the aurora borealis are glorious. The hero is plucky, resourceful, and resilient, and so is Astrid (America Ferrera), the blond viking lass who's the tuffest kid in town but also the most empathetic. The old man is gruff, inarticulate, and set in his ways (that would be the old ways), but he dearly loves his misfit son and wishes only the best for him; he's also one hell of a warrior. For some odd reason, all the kids speak colloquial English, but all the adults have a thick Scottish brogue \u2014 no hint of Scandinavia in any of it. Perhaps that's yet another wrinkle in the movie's offbeat sense of humor, which is never thigh-slappingly hilarious but produces plenty of smiles and grins. This is anything but a \"message\" movie, but there are lessons to be learned from it. They're like the medicine hidden in the spoonful of sugar. You get better while feeling good about it. Yum!", "This story captivated me from the get-go. From the moment we see Hiccup take down Toothless, I was enthralled with the story. Characterization was excellent by all the voice-actors and animators. But it was and is the story that really makes this movie worth the price of a theater ticket. As the story moves forward, Hiccup's growing friendship with Toothless along with the expectations of his tribe known really keeps a viewer on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next.  The revelations in the film about the dragons pull at one's emotions. One theme that runs throughout the story is the concept of overcoming prejudice. Hiccup is perceived by everyone as \"the useless\" and the dragons as vicious beasts that the vikings should always \"kill on sight\". As the story progresses those perceptions change -- first the villager's perception of Hiccup and then the error of everything the viking's supposedly \"knew\" about their supposed enemies -- making it all look like foolishness in the end. And the resolution definitely makes you smile. The STORY is what really makes this movie.", "Up until Shrek Dreamworks wasn't making great animated films and then that green ogre came along and change that. Shrek was most definitely my favourite Dramworks film, that is until i saw this. The vibrant colours and the stunning animation really captivated me and the music made the experience even more gratifying. Yes there were a few flaws, as their are with any film but this is most definitely as close to \"Pixar Perfection\" as Dreamworks will ever get. If your a fan of very funny, action packed, sort of emotion then go and see this film, i am serious drop what ever your doing now and get down to the cinema! It might not be as heart warming as Toy Story or as tear jerking as UP but it will most certainly give Pixar a run for its money in the action department. A most satisfying whole and this years best animated film, until Toy Story 3 that is!", "\"How to Train your Dragon\" is the latest digital animation movie from DreamWorks Animation studios (the same studio that produced the Shrek movies, \"Kung Fu Panda,\" and \"Bee Movie\"). The movie starts off with the narration of the main character, Hiccup (his name is explained in the movie), voiced by Jay Baruchel, describing his Viking hometown and the problems they have with dragons. The audience is thrust into an elaborate action sequence of dragons attacking Hiccup's village. This opening scene does justice to the advancements in digital animation and explores some inventive camera shots of the action and its characters. Young Hiccup wants to be a dragon fighter and have the chance to kill his first dragon. Why does he want to kill a dragon? It means he will be respected among his fellow Vikings. He has one big size issue though, considering the average Viking is four times his size, no one takes him seriously. Villagers ridicule his size often. He resorts to using his intelligence to solve his problems (it seems that for such a young mind he knows quite a bit about aerodynamic engineering). One of his inventions takes down a dreaded night fury dragon. Yet no one believes Hiccup is worthy of being a dragon slayer. The movie moves along smoothly with more being revealed about Hiccup and his situation. Turns out the head of village is also his dad, Stoick, voiced by Gerard Butler. Here is the setup of the traditional kids' movie story line where the child tries to prove himself to his father and/or mother. And yes, we have seen it before and the story is pretty formulaic, but this story does have emotion and well-written dialogue to keep the audience's interest. Hiccup ventures into the woods to find and slay the dragon he had taken down earlier only to find that he cannot kill the dragon. He eventually befriends the beast and learns the traits of the dragon species. There is a humorous and touching development between the boy and the dragon. Toothless (that's Hiccup's name for the new friend) has mood swings from a Clint Eastwood toughness to a Bambie-like curiosity and friendliness. The directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders (both of \"Mulan\" and \"Lilo and Stitch\" fame), put it together to make this friendship work so it doesn't come off too cheesy. Stoick eventually enrolls Hiccup into a dragon slaying class in the village. In the class, fellow village adolescents learn the proper Viking way to kill different varieties of dragons. What develops is the conflict within Hiccup \u2013 should he kill the dragons or should he befriend them? The imagery of the movie is outstanding. The art directors took their time and added the details in the background shots. The water and the fire caught my attention because those elements looked real. I also noticed the hair of the characters (I know I am nitpicking, but in a good way). Considering the era and primitive ways of the Vikings, I could see that their hair was chopped off with a knife. The villagers obviously didn't have a village barber shop. They simply cut their hair with what was available to them. It's a small detail I know, but little things like that made the movie feel realistic. Should you see this movie? Yes, it's a good kid's movie with only a few hidden adult jokes. The action will keep it together and hold your interest until the end. The kids will like the different varieties of dragons and most likely relate to one of the adolescent characters. To paraphrase my 10-year-old daughter \u2014 it is a good family story that is funny and yet scary at times (she was referring to the action sequences, but in a good way). One more thing, I saw the movie in 2D and I still feel it was great. Try seeing it in its 3D format; it almost has to be better.", "Let me think - the 3D was better, the plot more interesting, the characters more compelling and the conclusion more satisfying, in every way a better, more original movie than the \"King of the World's Ferngully.\" This time we actually got to root for the humans - a novel concept. The movie follows a misfit boy as he turns from a laughing stock of the town and he grows into the only person who seems to be able to get the dragons to do as he wants. There are many things to like about this movie and very little not to like. The movie was not pretentious...not full of itself just well made entertainment. I recommend this highly!", "Great story and amazing animation are only 2 of the reasons why this movie is one of the best animated movies to date. I loved every second of it and I believe anyone will at least have a great time watching this movie.", "I OFFICIALLY WANT A PET DRAGON. I literally fell in love with the Dragon that it feels that his (yes I said his) character arc is even deeper than the main character's. 10/10 no thought about it.", "In my opinion the best animation movie I have ever seen and it could easily score 10 out of 10, silly as it sounds I only gave it a 9 so I had wiggle room for the sequel. Jay Baruchel, who has done some decent movies, does the voice of Hiccup to perfection. The whole movie really revolves around Hiccup and Toothless, his young dragon.  As one other reviewer stated, Toothless exhibits masses of personality and is like a huge lovable puppy. Being able to display this level of personality without uttering a single word is beyond impressive. The addition of romance, comedy and action galore makes this a movie for all the family as I assume was Dreamworks aim. This is truly a fun movie that has to be seen to be believed. 9/10", "Now that's more like it! Last July, after I heralded Inception and Toy Story 3 as rescuing 2010 moviegoers from a year otherwise bereft of great storytelling, I received an email from a Dreamworks animator pointing me in the direction of How to Train Your Dragon. Word of mouth had been positive, but I had yet to check it out. Dreamworks Animation (Shrek, Over the Hedge, Monsters vs. Aliens) is known for targeting the funny bone of children and adults alike, but with the exception of Kung-Fu Panda, making films with heart and a spirit of adventure to match the humor hasn't seemed to be their priority. With How to Train Your Dragon, however, Dreamworks has raised their standard, making the race for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars much more interesting. Combining truly stunning visuals with well-rounded characters, Dragon doesn't insult the intelligence of young viewers. It is moving and uplifting, thrilling and funny, and uses its fantasy story to explore profound themes of prejudice, searching for personal identity, and longing for acceptance by a parent. If this sounds heavy, don't worry: you'll have a great time, and the action is pretty terrific. Listen for a great turn by Gerard Butler as a Viking father.", "All I can say is watch it... better yet, buy it on DVD. It's one of those movies you can watch multiple times (like the 1st Jurassic Park - However, I can do without Parts 2 & 3). The characters are awesome! You really find yourself getting invested in the each and every one and the actors that do the voice-overs really help to bring each character to life. I get very emotional watching movies (if they are good) and this one sure made me tear up a few times both in sadness and in happiness. If you like amazingly well done animation films with an actual story and DRAGONS, you'll LOVE this movie. Rent it! Buy it! Whatever, just WATCH IT!", "I almost never gives tens. But the more I look back on this unassuming, fatefully named animation production and the aftereffect that it has had. Not only for Dreamworks, but for other animations to follow (Frozen being a good example) the idea of a \"serious story with serious themes, but made for children\" has been taken to a whole new level with this film - Dreamworks and otherwise. Warning several clich\u00e9s are used in this film, but its (almost) impossible to find a decent one that doesn't. Vikings speak Scottish, children don't, weaponry and terminology centuries ahead of its time, and well... dragons. None of it makes sense. It doesn't even follow the book it's based on. But it works. It really does. As previously said by others, Dreamworks Animation should see this production as their new \"true north\". Credible characters, positive roll models, great music and, above all, dragons! Kids love it and so do I.", "Here's yet another great film that I missed the boat on initially. I typically stay away from kid's movies (save classic Disney) because they tend to be overly simplistic bores that would only entertain the youngest of children. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is one of best of the lot, however, because of its excellent animation and a compelling story with themes that will resonate with viewers of all ages. The movie takes place in an indeterminate time period when Vikings and dragons coexisted, although not peacefully as the beginning makes perfectly clear. They're mortal enemies, in fact, and Vikings train from a very young age to be able to kill the beasts who raid their village and steal their livestock. Everyone, that is, except Hiccup. Hiccup is what you could call an outcast or a reject. He wants to join his peers in training, but nobody ever seems to want to give him a chance. Fortunately, he gets one, though not in the way you'd expect. As the title indicates, there is some dragon training that goes down, but not without a serious paradigm shift. At its core, this movie is about a young boy who doesn't quite fit in, yet finds a way to make himself valuable to the people around him. There is also a subtext about learning to empathize and/or come to terms with things that we don't understand, and therefore fear. Both of these messages are very pertinent to people, young and old, and are dealt with in a mature, yet accessible way. For the kids, you have the spectacle of expertly animated flying sequences and a killer battle with the big-bad dragon. For adults (and more discerning children), you have the meatier stuff about acceptance and overcoming your fears. It's really one of the best animated films I've ever seen, on multiple levels. While DreamWorks might have made their name with Shrek, I think that this will have a bit more staying power in years to come. In fact, this is so good that it pains me to even gripe about a single thing, so I'll make it brief. The setup of the movie is a bit roughly handled, and the characters (initially) aren't really given their due. But the movie improves drastically as it progresses, so much so that you almost forget the slightly weak first act. Overall, this is a movie I see myself watching again and again, and I'll definitely be checking out the sequel. Do yourself a favor and go watch this right now. You'll be glad you did.", "How to Train your Dragon is directed Dean DeBlois, and stars Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, and America Ferrera. This film easily surpasses Toy Story 3, and Despicable Me, How to Train your Dragon is about a young viking named Hiccup, who discovers a Nightfury, the most feared dragon in the village, whom he names Toothless (don't worry i'll get to Toothless later) they share a bond, which nobody in the village thought possible (if they even knew about it in the first place). Toothless, is one of the cutest, one of the most adorable, and one of the most awesome talkless characters in any film, Toothless is the best, and probably the best part of the film, but their is a lot more in this film that is really good. The Humor in this film is brilliant, and the voice acting is fairly good. The Sarcasm is dripping in this movie, but if their is one thing I didn't like in this movie was Astrid in the very beginning, she was really not that great of a character. The Twins are hilarious, and the best scenes in the movie are with Hiccup, and Toothless, some of the best scenes in any movie, and of course the soundtrack, this soundtrack is beautiful, I love this soundtrack. + Great Animation + Great Story + Toothless + Soundtrack + Hiccup + Pacing + Action scenes are great. + Good Ending + Scenes with Hiccup and Toothless are incredible.", "Wow.what an extraordinary movie.Epic.Really one of the best animated movies i have ever seen.Just doesn't get bored.I watched it like nearly 20 times and i just want to watch it one more time.Breath taking movie.Animation is just fantastic.Really deserves an Oscar.Toy story 3 doesn't deserve an Oscar at all.It's kind of boring.But How to train your dragon is enjoyable every bit from the start to the end.Dialogues are awesome and Jay baruchel's voice for Hiccup is perfectly matched.The way he trains toothless,the way he builds a wing for toothless and the scene of their first flight is breath taking and i really got goosebumps watching that scene.The climax scene.Oh my goodness.What can i say about that.Awesome.Really extraordinary.", "No story is truly original. That is a fact when it comes to writing. Each film you watch, every novel you read, every song you hear, all can be likened to similar tales from any medium. Of course, some stories are more common than others. None of this is an issue, once the execution is done right. It is rarely you see a film that tells an age old tale in such an inspired way, that it feels new again. This is the case with How to Train Your Dragon. Based *loosely* on the book of the same name, the CGI adventure is directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBois (Lilo & Stitch), and tells the story of a Viking teen named Hiccup (Jay Baruchel). Hiccup is weedy and nerdy, which ostracizes him from his peers and his father, Stoic (Gerard Butler), who happens to be the chief of their village. Berk, the aforementioned village, has been plagued for years by dragons, who steal livestock and burn down buildings. In order to gain the respect from the village, especially his father, Hiccup invents a machine to take down the most feared and rarest of all dragons \u2013 the Night Fury. Naturally, Hiccup manages to capture a Night Fury, but finds that he cannot kill him. Instead, he sets him free, and decides to study him. Meanwhile, Stoic tries to help his son mingle with his peers and gain confidence by enrolling him in dragon training. Hiccup meets the dragon in secret, and slowly befriends him, naming him Toothless due to his retractable teeth. The pair soon develops a strong bond, with Toothless even allowing Hiccup to ride him, with the help of a new tail fin that Hiccup makes. It is due to his friendship with Toothless that Hiccup realizes that everything Vikings believe about dragons is wrong. He now faces uncertainty when he becomes top of his class due to his sudden surge of dragon knowledge, and has to kill a dragon in front of the village, including his father, who knows nothing of his new friend. The story soon lies on a precipice; will Hiccup be able to forge a new era of peace, or is the life of his best friend in grave danger? What we have here, is two very common stories; the boy and his dog story, and the underdog tale. Such stories are so well worn, that not only are they staples in family entertainment (see Old Yeller, My Dog Skip, Teen Wolf, and many more), but they have been done so much that they can form a predictable narrative, and several clich\u00e9s. However, the crew behind How to Train Your Dragon handle the story in such a way, that it feels like a new, crisp bed sheet. The characters are well rounded and wholly enjoyable, even Hiccup, with his nasally voice may poise an irritation for some. The other kids in the village are all voiced by massive talents, from T.J. Miller to Oscar nominated Jonah Hill, each who add so much character and life to such small roles. Gerard Butler is in fine, Scottish form as Stoic, and you can understand his plight with the dragons, and with his son; he lives in a culture where stature and strength is a major factor, he is the head of a village that is being bombarded by fire breathing beasts. The strained relationship he shares with Hiccup is one of respect and longing, and the time that is spent on them is just enough to show how much care and love is hidden. However, the most poignant relationship is between Hiccup and Toothless; the time and passion dedicated to nurturing their relationship is a wonder to behold. Their bond is obvious, and needs very few words to describe; the majority is done through the masterful animation, character interactions, John Powell's powerful score, and the perfect amount of pacing. It is clear to the viewer that boy and dragon have forged an unbreakable bond, and that is one of the film's most lasting and endearing points. A marvel on his own is the dragon himself. Toothless is the star of the film, with his Stitch like features and expressive eyes, and qualities that fall in tandem with mostly cats and a handful of dog, Toothless is a wonder of character and animation. With his little purrs and rumbling growls, and unique little mannerisms and movements, Toothless is a fine example of how one needs not a witty script to be one of the most memorable characters of recent memory. In fact, Toothless is rather funny in his own way, which is all done through his character animations and vocalizations. The animation still looks astounding today, six years after the film's release. The fire effects, flying scenes, the way Toothless spreads his wings, still amaze me. The only film that trumps it is the sequel, which eats this film's dust. But that's a review for another time; let's just say that both films are things of beauty, and represent how much animation has evolved. The music is stirring and emotionally breathtaking. Each dragon has its own personality, that even with short screen time, each feel like a real character. It is clear that much thought went into the overall feel and look of this film. How to Train Your Dragon is a fine example of how, when in the right hands, age old stories can be told anew. With a clever script, and emotionally resonant relationships and relatable circumstances, DreamWorks managed to produce what is easily a near masterpiece. This dragon doesn't just fly high, it soars. Rating: A1.", "This movie, I liked it. I usually don't enjoy watching movies set back into medieval times or the old ages, but this was great! The plot was amazing and understandable for children. The effects were realistic and you can tell they put a lot of work into this. I think this is Dream Works best imaginative movie, right next to Shrek. These type of movies lets kids have an imagination and they can believe. It shows them how fun it can be to have their own dream world. The movie wasn't too violent nor scary and it was good for any age. I highly suggest this movie. 9/10", "I absolutely loved this movie! The bond between a boy and a dragon can be so spectacular, the way they made this movie was so very touching. I bet anyone who loves a good friendship bond, will love this movie to the max! The graphics were also a big hit in this movie, I watched this movie and in many of the scenes you think \"Hey that looks so real!\" I experienced that with most of the movie. I'm so happy with the way this movie came out, I usually watch any animated movie to see how it is but this movie really stood out to me. I wish for anyone to watch it, please, it's such a great movie and anyone who loves a heart warming movie really needs to watch this. This movie really did deserve all the awards it got, they all put so much time and heart into this fantastic movie and they did such a great job that it blew me away. They have so many fantastic actors in this as well, Jay Baruchel(Hiccup) is one of my favorite actors along with Gerard Butler(Stoick) they do a fantastic job like always along with the other great actors. So if you enjoy these actors as much as I do please watch this movie! I'm sorry for going on for so long but I just love this movie so much and appreciate everyones hard work, thank you!", "How to train your dragon is an Amazing film, DreamWorks Animation has really outdone themselves. The story-line is almost perfect and every minute of the movie is exciting. The Animation of the film is incredible. The nature,the characters, the dragons and Berk the city were really detailed and very well done. (Bluray at least 720p) The movie it self, about a boy who's father is the head-viking disappointed because he's \"unsual\" or \"diffrent\" from the other vikings, he's not meant to be a Dragon slayer. He change's the way the vikings has lived for hundreds of years by showing people that slaying the dragons isn't the right way. I've watched this movie about 5 times my self and probably at least the same amount with my nephew who's almost 3 years old. It's amazing to see that although he's 3 and from Sweden and watching it with English language he never gets bored, he wants to watch the dragon every time he's at my house. DreamWorks has made such an amazing film and i think it deserves 10/10 every time i watch it. The movie can be watched by both adults and children of all age. I do recommend to watch it in Bluray at least 720p with a HD TV with surround system sound for the perfect experience. I would recommend this film to everyone, at any age. 10/10", "This is perhaps one of my favourite movies of the decade thus far. I found it so compelling and engrossing that I signed up to IMDb just to write this review. This is the kind of animated movie that is in the same caliber as Toy Story and Wall-E, without a doubt. While somewhat different to the book, even the author has approved of changes made for the film. I'm not going to go on and on about the excellent voice acting and the animation and how adorable the main dragon is...just go and watch this movie as soon as you can and I promise you this- You will not regret it.", "How to Train Your Dragon is honestly one of my favourite films of all time. If you're a fan of fantasy animation such as Rise of the Guardians, Brave or Tangled then I highly recommend this film. By using key techniques that are done in a perfectly appropriate way, this mind- blowing film appeals to all audiences. The film focuses on the importance of victory and acceptance, instead of a clich\u00e9 love story that is found in most family fantasy films. With the fantastic use of animation, working perfectly with the spiritual music, this film never fails to widen it's audience's eyes. You will never know what will happen next. Though very different from the original books, I personally prefer the ideas used in this film. Because of the chilling mystery and edgy humour, and with a hint of romance, the film sticks to the meaning of the plot without drifting off into some cheesy romantic comedy. Also with the brilliant voice acting from Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera and Kristen Wiig, the characters vary personality; ranging from brave and superior to shy and timid, the characters are all likable. Then of course the legendary dragons, who seem to have personalities themselves, bring humour and imagination to the film, as well as going against the typical tropes of most dragon tales. Overall, I guarantee no matter how old you are, you will be amazed by this film.", "Have you ever felt like a disappointment to everyone you know? Someone your parents and peers think of as an anchor dragging the rest of them down or as a mere inconvenience? How do you get past that? Berk is a small, Viking village located near the Arctic Circle. At least, that's an assumption I made based on the main character's statement that \"it snows nine months of the year and hails the other three\". That main character, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is the only son of the village chief, Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler). The village is under near-constant siege by outside forces. Those outside forces being dragons. Hiccup (Baruchel) is short, slim, and in no way strong. The one trade all villagers learn in their lifetime is the art of hunting and killing dragons. Gobber (Hiccup's employer and the proprietor of the village armory, voiced by Craig Ferguson) suggests that Hiccup stop all of \"this\" while gesturing to all of him. Gobber (Ferguson) is a man who has lost several limbs over the years, all during encounters with dragons. Hiccup, being seriously lacking in physical strength, designs and constructs a machine to propel the weapons that the other villagers simply throw by hand. Of course, during a trial run in front of Gobber, the machine strikes a villager. Hiccup takes that same apparatus to a mountaintop, fires on one of the few species of dragon that's never been captured or seen and, miraculously, causes that dragon to fall to earth. Overjoyed by this victory, Hiccup shouts in triumph but is soon set upon by a species of dragon that can breathe fire and produce fire throughout its entire body. He's rescued by his father who expresses disappointment in his son and disbelief in Hiccup's claim to have landed a blow against a Night Fury. He treks through the woods the next day, determined to find proof of his accomplishment, but finds something far more significant. Now, unlike a lot of \"adults\" I maintain my affection for \"children's\" movies. This is not to say that I like all, or even most, children's movies. For example, Despicable Me, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and Eight Crazy Nights disappointed me to a degree that I cannot express in words. But, in spite of its flaws or maybe because of them, I loved How to Train Your Dragon. Casting Baruchel as Hiccup was genius. Hiccup's peers, voiced by Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, America Ferrara and others, fit the roles they're given perfectly. If you have children who haven't seen this movie, you should take steps to remedy that. If you don't have children but can enjoy movies that are produced for them, like I do, check it out.", "Many die hard toy-story fans will hate me for saying it, and while I am a huge fan of Pixar movies, How to Train Your Dragon is the best animated movie I have, and likely will ever see. On the first hand it has a unique story. Of course in the broad sense it is an \"underdog gains special powers and triumphs\" movie, but it has much more under the surface. The deep emotions between the main character and the dragon are powerful to say the least. The animations are whimsical enough to be enjoyed by children, but many scenes feature elements that knock the breath out of even the most critical viewers.  One of my favorite elements of the movie was the soundtrack, it is literally, unarguably, exceptionally, perfect. The music matches every movement and every emotion. There is one scene in particular that has me holding my breath every time I see it, and the incredible music is what brings it all together.  If you haven't watched How to Train Your Dragon, you are missing out. In summary, I would describe this movie as a beautifully created tale of simple concept, with monumental outcome.", "How To Train Your Dragon is a genuinely classic animate feature. It is a simple story yet wonderfully told, boasting incredible animation and a sharp and witty script. Characters are memorable and the dragon's designs are ripped straight from a storybook. The whole film is beautiful to look at, but the best scenes are the flights around the island. They are absolutely stunning and look gorgeous. These wide, panning shots will send chills down your spine.  There is something here for everyone, and I hope that there will be more films directed by Chris and Dean. They have created Dreamwork's best and most memorable film (and re-watchable too).", "I first saw this film and I was convinced it was for kids only, but when it started going, I found it really enjoyable. It's not the best animation I've seen, but its really amazing. Some scenes I think are a bit scary for younger children, so they might want to watch with an adult. It was my niece who made me watch the film in the first place, and she's 8 years old, but I actually think I enjoyed it more than her. She still liked it and she watched it again the next day apparently. I also made my mates watch it as well, and they really enjoyed it to. I can't see why some people give really bad reviews about this, because I think it's amazing animation. I still don't think it's better than any toy story's or shrek, but I still think its amazing. The story line is about a boy called Hiccup, who isn't really good at killing dragons, but he wants to. But when he meets Toothless, the Night Fury, he's not so sure anymore. It's funny, adventure, and really nice film. I recommend this film for every age. I mean, I'm an adult and I enjoyed it, and so did all of my family and friends.", "After seeing this film three times now (twice in 3D on the silver screen and once on the idiot box), I'm of the opinion that it is a near-perfect masterpiece of modern animation. When this film came out in 2010, I was enraptured and astonished by the beauty and colour of this northern world with its stalwart Viking society and wonderful variety of dragons. Who was responsible for that? Art director Pierre-Olivier Vincent? I'm sure it was a whole team of people. The 3D effects are spectacular. The engaging and heartwarming story (based on a book by Cressida Cowell) hits home for both kids and adults. Hiccup, the little Viking who could, is a great character. Some of it is clich\u00e9, but it didn't matter. Yes, I know it's a movie for kids, but there was something clever about it that raised it to a level that adults can appreciate. Kudos to DeBlois, Davies and Sanders for bringing us this imaginative, evocative and, yes, magical film. It's going to be hard to beat this in 2014, but they can certainly count on filling the seats.", "The idea of taking my crazy younger cousins to see an animated dragon movie didn't intrigue me too much. I imagined myself sitting in my seat bored to death, hoping the end could come quicker so I could go be with my friends. Boy was I wrong! I could have stayed after the movie was over for multiple re runs, I loved it so much. It is safe to say that during the car ride home and for several days after I was the loudest and most excited critic of the bunch. Directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders did an incredible job of creating an amazing film that follows a typical storyline of a misfit boy that wants to impress his strong willed dad. In the typical storyline the father and son get into some fights, make up and then in the end everyone is happy. Instead of being like all the other films, this film is different because it incorporates incredible animation that interests its whole audience instead of just the younger kids in the theater. How to Train Your Dragon came into theaters March of 2010. In November 2012 I had to go to three different video stores to find a copy of this movie to watch because they were all rented out. Sanders and DeBlois made a masterpiece of a movie, by forming a perfect cast of actors and creating amazing animation for an audience of all ages, even stubborn sixteen year olds. This is a definite blockbuster holiday get together hit! The main character, Hiccup, is played by Jay Baruchel. Hiccup is the misfit, skinny, awkward young boy that can't seem to do anything right to make his father proud until the end of the movie when Hiccup finally proves to his father the way dragons really are. Baruchel was the perfect actor to voice Hiccup because he himself is known for his lankiness and awkward yet endearing characteristics. I went through the list of actors after watching the movie and did research to realize each actor's character virtually represented them in the movie. Not only with their personality but looks as well. Having this representation on screen makes a huge difference for the audience because the voice and appearance of the character look natural. It is also a benefit for the actors themselves because it really makes it easier for them to get into character. The animation in this movie was produced by DreamWorks Animation Company and they did more than a great job on this film. From the moment the movie started rolling to the last scene before the credits I was in awe of all the depth and angles of the scenery throughout the film. The emotion and feeling put into the characters made this animation amazing. They made the dragons come to life and created them to be absolutely adorable. Especially Toothless, I felt such a connection to him just by his body language and appearance. In a way Toothless represented my younger cousin sitting next to me in the movie theater, I almost felt like I was responsible for Toothless and his safety just as I was for my cousin. When Toothless was trapped by fire and then struggling for survival under water at the end of the movie I found myself clenching my seat and just wanting to scream for Hiccup to go help him! Overall this was a great movie and it surpassed my expectations way more than I ever imagined. I can't wait for How to Train Your Dragon 2 to come out. Thank you to everyone that was involved for making this film and congratulations on doing such a great job!", "I shall start of by saying that this is my all-time favourite animated, and modern film, and my favourite overall (after The Matrix). If you go to this film expecting childish and simple, you'll be pleasantly surprised - although it originates from a short children's story, the film is incredibly far from this style. Suitable for all ages without being cringeworthy, and with a story that's closer to a humorous drama than a dramatic comedy, this film deviates from Dreamworks' usual style into something, in my personal opinion, much better; the visuals are breathtaking, the dragons are fantastic, the people are believable and the script is amazing. The most amazing part of the movie however, is the music; the tracks themselves are brilliant, and without their presence in the film, it would be lacking in so much emotion. Even more so amazing, is that the music amplifies the emotion in the film without being overly obvious - so much so that it took until the second watching before I realised that the 'forbidden friendship' scene was only as beautiful as it was because of the score. After I left the cinema, I felt so empty that I was drawn to see it again and again, something which no other film so far has done for me.", "What I find so impressive with How to train your dragon is what I also stated in the title of this review, it has something for people of most ages. Also the stuff that will be enjoyed by the younger and the more grown up are not necessarily always the same things. I shall explain further what I mean by that. The story works great in that it is perfectly considered for the younger group. But I think the older part of the viewers will feel that the story just works well, not that it's bad or to thin in any way but just nothing special for them. What the more grown ups will find so brilliant is the humor. The humor is brilliant, specially the dialogue. The dialogue is so fun to listen to. But the reason is not really the jokes which I don't think have such a big part. The voices are brilliant and the dialogue is spoken in slack tone that make me laugh out loud just hearing it no matter what exactly is being said. The film also contains so parts of slapstick humor which all will find funny and it doesn't take a to big role either. Personally I found the humorous parts of much more entertainment than the story which filled it's part enough but not anything more. One other pleasure with this film is the animation, both technically and aesthetically. The humans look funny which is great but this is more a film about dragons and those also are the biggest viewing pleasure. Not only are they superbly designed but the way they move and specially the faces is massively impressive. The dragons behavior makes me think of cats and they definitively studied real animals for the animation. The dragons are both cute and fun to watch. There are some sentimental scenes in it to. What is impressive is that the emotional stuff more come from the visual rather than like more often story depth. The flying scenes are very impressive in the design and actually makes me think of Avatar, yes I think it's done on that level and I haven't seen dragon in 3D. Does the movie contain some moral message. Others have commented that it has, often I don't like when movies try to hide some message under a great production like some kind of propaganda. However even if someone maybe thinks this has some point to make it's nothing that I took any really note of so one can enjoy the film just as a piece of entertainment and that all which I am thankful for. How to train your dragon is a brilliantly entertaining piece. Perfect humor and effects, the part I enjoyed the most. Also it has a great story for the younger and works enough for the older to. When the film is over I feel like I could soon see it again and enjoy it just as much. I give How to train your dragon a 8/10. Great!", "I remembered hearing my cousin stating how much she enjoyed this movie in the Spring-time upon it's release. Feel sorry I missed it's outing in the theater. It is a gem of a production - better than Toy Story 3 or Despicable Me. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" captures the magic that any good live-action movie has done in the past with animals. It is masterfully put together with a great balance of humor and adventure. The dragon training scenes and friendship alone is worth watching the movie - the other core characters and story are just \"icing on the cake\". I just hope they leave it alone for sequels. Great movies do not need them.", "I had been wanting to see \"How to train your dragon\" for a very long time, since i had heard from everyone what a great movie it is. I thought to myself OK a cartoon sure they are great how can this one stand out from the rest though. My expectations were exceeded!! The plot was fantastic, it had just the right amount of action, comedy, suspense, romance. And of course what a better way to say to people that appearances may be misleading than by figuring out that the so called \"bad guys\" the dragons are actually good. Toothless, the main dragon was amazing! It was a mixture between a cat and a dog and it managed to show how all living creatures have feelings! Sure one might say that we have seen all this before in other films but what makes this one stand out I believe is that it stays true in the concept it wants to exhibit which is the friendship and connection of all living creatures and how love prevails all evil and of course the very strong tool this movie had was that all side plots were limited to the perfect amount not to let the audience go astray from the main theme. Simply fantastic, touching and memorable. This movie is a call to everyone of \"how to train directors to make such great films like this one!\"", "A brilliant film, even if it's not that true to the book. It's charming, funny, predictable and realistic. An impressive feat for something involving dragons. I want to watch this movie in 4D! Or in a simulator of some form. Hiccup for starters is awesome, you can't help but laugh at his voice overs and it's clear from the start he seems to be the only viking in the village with any sense. Speaking of the starting, what a scene! It's a brilliant summary of Derk and shows everything in just a few minutes. Toothless the dragon immediately made me think first of Stitch (from Lilo and Stitch) and then bearded dragons (a cool lizard, look it up on Google images to see what I mean), that reptile and almost alien feel is reflected whenever you see it. Yet it still retains the cuteness of a puppy with it's perky ears and big round eyes. If anything I was disappointed that it wasn't more scary for being the fearsome Night Fury. The animators have done a great job on all of the dragons, I love their specified abilities, the fire effects and just generally how real they seem. From what I've read of the book I now know they even included the points for each dragon quality like top trumps cards as they are displayed in the book. As for the plot, it couldn't have been more predictable but I do not look at that as a disadvantage. The atmospheric charm of the skies catches you if nothing else does, it is something to look at, not something to be over-analysed (I suppose I'm hardly one to talk). However I do like the slight twist at the end, Hiccup loses his leg! You see characters go in and out of fires, huge explosions and god knows what else in all the cheesy movies (excepting occasional good ones that don't get by on impressive effects) yet they don't lose anything! Maybe a few relatives, but in the really cheesy movies not even that! Hiccup loses his leg. Now that's realistic. Half of the villagers in Derk have a certain lack of limbs, just because he's the hero doesn't excuse him. YAY!", "Knowing that this was a Dreamworks films, I was expecting a movie similar to Shrek or other Dreamworks movies, which in my opinion have only average story lines. But what I got was far greater than what I had expected. The animation was terrific, the music was great, and I loved the interactions between the main character and his dragon. This film has easily become my favorite Dreamworks animated movie. It is one of the best animated films that i have ever seen. After seeing this movie, I look forward to what else Dreamworks will give us and will have better expectations for future movies.", "HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON - CATCH IT This is undoubtedly the best movie so far, Its just Amazing. though through the promos the movie looks One Dimensional like its the same story Dragons destroyed the villages and then One Dragon becomes friend... with the Hero and Blah Blah Blah... But its more then that. Simply Incredible bx they showed us that the Dangerous dragons are friendlier and can be the Cutest creatures on planet. I loved everything about it. I can watch over and Over Again and Can't Waite for the Squeal. :-) Every One should watch it Right Away. I truly hope that this movie win and Oscar for presenting something entirely different and hilarious.", "Hiccup is a young viking unlike any previous portrayal of a viking, being weak, scrawny, intelligent and strategic rather than all brains and muscle. In his village however this is unappreciated as what they need are strong, beefy men to fend off the nightly attack of the local dragons. However during the last attack Hiccup believes he has killed the most dangerous dragon of all, the mysterious night-fury, and upon searching the forest, Hiccup does indeed find the downed beast. Although he knows he should kill the dragon which is what he is trained to do, Hiccup releases the beast, and over time, due to circumstances I won't go into here an unlikely bond develops between man and dragon. Hiccup eventually uses this knowledge to overcome other Dragons as his father (Stoic) enrols him into Dragon killing class, but will the knowledge be enough to finally gain his father's respect and save his village?  Dreamworks animation has over the years provided us with much in the way of animated comedies and it is an area they usually excel in, from Shrek to Madagascar and the most recent of comedic hits, Kung Fu Panda, the studio shines in their ability to tap into today's post- modern thinking, but the two things their films may have lacked before now is, perhaps, a genuine sense of fear for the characters, something that the best Pixar films always have, and ...heart; the ability to tap into that part of us that puts us firmly into the characters plight on screen. This is the first Dreamworks film that succeeds were others have failed. It is always a good sign when a films box office performance increases due to extremely positive word of mouth. The only other film I can think of that has done this is the Farrelly's \"There's something about Mary\". The story of Hiccup and toothless is charming, scary in parts, but very endearing and the animation is not as overtly stylized and, well, not quite as good as Pixar-esquire, as previous outings have been. The voice work is very good by the four leads, Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson and America Ferreira, and the main threat, when it is ultimately revealed, is one that is genuinely frightening. There are few things better in cinema than that feeling of \"How the hell is the hero gonna beat that?\"  The direction and writing are decent enough but this is one of those films were the sum of the parts are actually far more than the the individual pieces combined. But perhaps the best thing about this film is, well without giving anything away, it's the fact that we don't get a complete pat happy ending. The final reveal of the horror of war and battle is almost unbelievable in a family film and I was completely shocked that a major studio had the guts to do something like this in a big budget movie and we should all doff are hats to them for such a bold move. Congratulations Deamworks animation. You've come of age.", "Whether you are an adult looking for a good movie or you are looking for a fun, clean movie for your kids, How To Train Your Dragon is the movie for you. Its combination of side-splitting humor, beautiful music, fascinating storyline, heart-warming characters and events, and exciting adventure make it entertaining from start to finish. Moreover, Toothless is adorable and the animation is great :-) The only (allow me to repeat- the only) problem with this is that the Vikings have Scottish accents. But, hey, you're dealing with a cartoon that has dragons! It's not meant to be accurate or realistic! :D I would give a more in-depth review of this masterpiece (and I don't use that word lightly), but I don't want to ruin your viewing experience by revealing the storyline.", "I signed up to IMDb just to write this brief commentary.  \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is oozing with charm, the focus being on the protagonist, \"Hiccup\", who at first glance is a rather unremarkable young boy seeking a means to distinguish himself within his small village full of large Vikings. The characters are expressive and the animation conveys the subtle emotions in their interactions beautifully throughout. There is so much to appreciate as part of this viewing experience besides mere aesthetics (astounding though they are). The music is truly inspired, it making use of traditional instruments with a modern accompaniment and chosen carefully to amplify the emotions on screen. This entire film is based on the development of its characters, their common goal being the means through which they learn and draw together. The life lessons contained herein are certainly not new to an adult audience but everyone can do with a reminder, something the story does beautifully through the interactions between the veteran warriors and their new generation.  Whether you're a fan of medieval fantasy or the voyage of discovery, \"How to Train your Dragon\" will leave you in awe.", "How To Train Your Dragon Every manager knows the proper way to train a new employee is to have him or her interact with co-workers whilst wearing a nametag that reads: \"My name is Trainee\". Unfortunately, the nametag belonging to the trainee in this animated adventure has melted. Raised by an autocratic Viking father (Gerard Butler), who doesn't think he can become a proper dragon slayer, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) tries desperately to impress him by bringing down an elusive dragon. Unable to slay the injured beast, Hiccup instead nurses it back to health. Now, it's up to the unlikely pair to quell the fire-breathing feud between dragons and Vikings before both species are eradicated. A rip-roaring ride through the skies, How To Train Your Dragon strikes a nice balance between action and humour. Furthermore, it offers hope to those less successful dragon trainers out there whose healthcare providers refuse to cover any more skin grafts. (Green Light)", "Everything in this charming morality tale has been done before. The hero learns to question his most deeply ingrained assumptions, overcomes opposition and changes everything. But it's visually spectacular, has some laugh out loud moments as well as some genuinely moving scenes, and a brisk pace that never bogs down. A medieval settlement is plagued by dragon attacks, but instead of being stock European serfs who flee from danger and wait for a knight to save them, these villagers are Vikings who fight back pretty much on equal terms. Interestingly, the elder Vikings have accents that sound more Scottish than Scandinavian, although I do confess I've never actually heard a real Viking talk. Hiccup, the embarrassing son of the rowdiest Viking of them all, befriends a dragon, learns the secrets of dragons and why they raid his village, and finally leads an attack that saves his father, the other Vikings, and the dragons themselves. One of the prize moments in the film comes when Hiccup's father sees his son riding a dragon to the rescue and soundlessly mouths \"what the ---?\" The aerial scenes are beautiful and thrilling. Great, great fun.", "This movie is what I call an animated classic! It is not only the best animated movie ever made but does the greatest job in movie film-making. Dragons of all ages will be delighted on how wonderfully told and acted a kids movie can really be. The dragons were very cute especially toothless and Hiccup the owner. His girlfriend was hot except she is much older than I am. For any Dragon lover or movie fan drop by at your nearest cinema and spend your money just to see this wonderful delight where there will be times where you may laugh and giggle have an awesome dragon ride and maybe near the end have a few tears running down your cheeks. Truly an epic classic animation and is very highly recommended.", "\"How to train your dragon\" is based on a humorous fantasy novel of the same name. I cannot compare the stories of the two but where the book has rather ugly pictures, the movie dazzles with amazing visuals. I think they would be great looking even if you didn't see the movie in 3d. It's not only the quality of the renders, it's the quality of the animation. I think it works best when the young viking Hiccup starts to interact with the fallen dragon. They are very lifelike and expressive even though the dragon does not talk. Later on, the flying sequences are not only spectacular but exhilarating. I had my doubts about the look of the main dragon (the one on the posters) but it managed to win my approval in both looks (a bit small though) but mostly personality wise.  There's lots of very dynamic exciting action in this movie and it's mostly done with a cheerful fun tone most of the time even though there's still danger. As I recall, there's no visible gore, dismemberments or even blood, making it very family friendly. However, despite that lack of \"realism\", I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. I think Gerard Butler voicing the viking chief is a natural for that kind of stoic warrior role. However, I would have preferred another voice for the teen hero as I found it sounding too old (the actor is in his late twenties). The rest of the voice cast is fine. My only other criticism is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it. So, all in all, provided you still have a little bit of a kid's heart in you and are not allergic to dragons, it's likely you will have a great time watching this very entertaining movie. Rating : 8 out of 10", "Hiccup, the son of a tribes headman lives in a typical fishing village. Picturesque medieval housing at the sea, with fresh fish to eat a plenty, sunny meadows where the sheep graze before they're eaten. For the most, life is good. Apart from the dragons that sometimes attack the town. Story wise the film starts with this baseline and then builds out on a typical growing up kid story that desperately wants to impress his father who that cannot see beyond his own expectations for the kid. Now, all that wouldn't be fun at all, at least not for its intended audience - kids. So, the tangent of dragons and befriending them is added. Everything that happens is highly predictable but it fits and it makes for a more than decent base for the rest of the film - which consists of mostly great animation, some added 3D effects and fast paced action. All in all, the film is great for its intended audience and good for the parents that go along to see it with their kids. And the 3D? It's a good add-on and not overused, it fits. 8 out of 10 dragons running amok", "Ah, good ol' Dreamworks. As their most successful-albeit overused-cash cow is the Shrek series; it's pretty hard to distinguish any other of their movies as gems. However, while a humorous approach has been taken to their movies, many of them have had different results. For example, the 2004 movie 'Shark Tale' was an utter disaster, while 2008's 'Kung Fu Panda' was funny as well as plenty entertaining. Their latest romp, 'How to Train your Dragon,' definitely falls into the same category as the latter, but also succeeds in distinguishing itself as a completely different movie. Based on the book series by British author Cressida Cowell and directed by Disney alum Chris Sanders (Lilo and Stitch), the story centers around a young Viking lad named Hiccup (Jay Baruchel, whose nasal tone compliments him both physically and mentally) whose absent- minded ideas and wry sense of humor make him outcasted by other Viking teens, as well as shunned by his father, the mighty Stoick (Gerard Butler, also perfect). But, when one of his inventions actually manages to capture the mysterious Night Fury, he finds himself befriending it in secret, as well as learning from it to become the first 'dragon trainer.' But when he finds himself at odds with not only the town, but with the dragons themselves, he also finds himself with the key to making peace betwixt the dragons and Vikings. The plot itself-even in a nutshell-is pretty enticing, but the trailer proved otherwise. It looked formulaic and joke-ridden from the first trailer, which made my skeptical side say, 'no way, Jose!' However, during the second trailer, I was reeled in. It was more dramatic, more depth defying, and definitely more plausible. From there, I was eager to see it\u0085and, let me say, its money well spent. At first, it seems that the plot is going to be a little formulaic. You know the story: The underdog, who everyone hates and can't seem to do anything right, proves the town wrong with his groundbreaking, but effective methods. That has indeed been done before, but, surprisingly, this plot enhances the story instead of slowing it down. Anything that seems to be a clich\u00e9 only gives the story the wings to fly...excuse the pun. The other big issue I had was with the side characters. No, I don't mean the brash, but helpful Gobber (played by a highly entertaining Craig Ferguson) or the beautiful, fiercely driven Astrid (America Fererra). I mean some of the other teens who are thrown into the dragon training ring with Hiccup, who is inept at first, but his friendship with Toothless helps him make his way up. Anyway, I thought that these four teens: The pigheaded jock, Snotlout (Jonah Hill, another cash cow), the adorable, girth-wide nerd Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz- Plasse, aka Superbad's McLovin), and, my personal favorites, the jugheaded, head-butting twins Ruffnut (a gravelly-voiced Kristen Wigg) and Tuffnut (A snarky TJ Miller). The latter have become a cult following that is huge in the online and fandom communities, much to the moviegoer's surprise. However, in the movie, these teens are only here to serve as the play- it-by-numbers obstacles that our main hero has to overcome on his own, though there are definitely more pressing issues. I would have liked to see more of them in the film, despite the fact that they might take away from the story. It just would have been nice to see someone sympathize with Hiccup. Oh, and one more thing-the dragons, man! All of them also have different types and personalities, which I think is kind of awesome. The flying scenes are pretty cool too, described by many to make 'Avatar' jealous. There's a lot to look at, so why not? Overall, this movie has more heart than most of their works (Save 'Kung Fu Panda'), as well as unbelievably creative settings and creatures. It's definitely worth the time to be swept off your feet by this instant classic.", "There is no fear in the child's eyes, only curiosity and love.", "Incredible! i watched it twice and it is just amazing. The script is really good and strong and it is for everyone, adults and kids. i recommended you to watch the other seasons they are very good specially the latest one, it is just unpredictable. I like the drawing methodology of Dream Works Animation, it makes you feel like it is real and you live the moment with the film.", "This movie is incredible for a plethora of reasons.\nThemes.\nCinemtography and lighting (Roger Deakins uwu).\nVoice acting (Jay Baruchell, most notably).\nAnimation, especially for its time (and even now).\nSimple yet powerful story. Structure, as in the clear links from one part of the story to the next, often with almost exactly the same phrases (eg. \"Why didn't you {kill}\" or \"I did this\").\nThe music score by John Powell.\nI could write a full essay analysis about this movie and explain in depth why I think it's so amazing. It's the closest I've ever seen a feature film get to perfect.", "Yes, I am just an 10 year old kid writing a review on one of the greatest films, out there, but I am putting a lot of effort into writing this. When I first saw this movie, I thought, hey! cool! dragons and stuff! not too big of a deal, right?\nBut this movie goes deep for a \"kids movie.\"\nThe story is deep and is perfect. The scenes, especially the first time Hiccup flies on Toothless, are stunning, and with the score, it becomes a masterpiece.\nThis movie clearly deserves a 10/10", "Absolutely gorgeous movie, the relationship between stoic and hiccup was wonderfully portrayed, I love th similarities that toothless has to a cat , you can see where the animators got their reference. Definitely definitely worth the watch no matter what age you are contains a lot of universal themes", "How to Train your Dragon (2010) is really an Enjoyable Movie for All Ages, and I can't stop watching it, because the story is good, and the music is very good.\nHow to Train your Dragon is the best movie", "I love this movie because it has great animation, likeable characters and fantastic battle scenes. And it is a good start for what is to become one of the greatest trilogies of all time.", "It took me a while to get to watch this movie, since I've heard and seen so much about it (that includes the TV show on CN). I only got the chance to see it recently this year and I was extremely pleasantly surprised by it. Recently I started watching movie trailers way more rarely than I did years ago... and that made me totally blind coming into this movie. I knew almost nothing about it and that made me experience the movie and appreciating it a lot more than I would have, had I watched the trailer/s. From the first scene this movie captured my attention and made me interested in the story since it was something about medieval times and dragons. And being a somewhat fan of Game of Thrones I was hooked on from the moment Hiccup told the story about Berk and the fight against the dragons. First of all the animation and the way this movie is created is absolutely stunning and way ahead of its time. The story got me from the first moment and there wasn't a single moment where I was \"can we get over with this to move on to something more exciting?\". The 98 minutes flew by me and I felt inspired, moved and most of all motivated throughout the whole movie. The soundtrack... now I gotta address this... John Powell was robbed of Oscar in 2011. I don't care what anyone else says about that... I've seen The Social Network and that soundtrack was absolutely horrible. There were at least three other soundtracks in 2010 way better than that: The King's Speech - Alexandre Desplat, Inception - Hans Zimmer, and this one. Now I understand that you shouldn't award another oscar to a composer who already won one (Hans Zimmer) but how could the academy rob John Powell of the oscar is beyond me. His score was inspiring, powerful, well suited for the time frame in the movie and motivating. There were tracks that while the movie was playing and the scene was going, it made me shed tears of joy and inspiration. Now that doesn't happen often and I can only name a couple of movies that did that to me: Interstellar, Braveheart, Avengers: Infinity War, The Dark Knight, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, ... I can honestly say that the best part of the movie was the score. The other great parts were, aside from the story which I already mentioned, the conclusion, the interactions between the characters and how everything tied together with everything. I could go on about the animation, cinematography or voice acting but for me a movie with a captivating story, wonderful soundtrack and inspiring and motivating moments is enough to call a masterpiece. And this is for me a masterpiece. One of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life!", "The story of the dragons being hunted like animals we know here on earth is truly inspiring. We see the relationship they had with the dragons a long time ago, they hated and feared the dragons because the people knew what they were capable of. It's like how us people were afraid of all unknown animals until we got to know them. Hiccup and toothless became best friends in the movie and did great things together. The war between dragons and humans was settled to become a bond they share and they work together to be one. This relationship shows how anyone can be friends and the past shouldn't reflect the present.", "This is literally the greatest animated movie I've ever seen. It will make you laugh and cry and smile right the way throughout. Stunning animation, brilliant characters and story that will live with you forever. This family movie is simply a MUST for anyone's movie library. You will watch again and again.", "A great story and well animated.Emotions are well connected.But it's a bit lengthy.Nice watch anyway", "When I finished this animation movie than I think if I brone in dragon world, I will fly with dragon.", "Can't wait to see How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World very soon", "This film was one of the most amazing films that i have ever seen. Jay Baruchel is fantastic as the lead and both Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson are amazing choices for their portrayals of their characters. 10/10 Would watch again!", "It's a film the whole family can enjoy over and over again. It is stunning to look at and listen to. A rating does not get 10 from me unless it has a brilliant story and compelling characters. There is so much that can be gleaned from this film by little children to adults. The themes are difficult ones to handle but done very well: not fitting in, being cut from a different cloth from those around you, being brave enough to form unorthodox friendships (a viking and a dragon), and being physically handicapped (the protagonist, teen Hiccup, ends up physically handicapped at the end). Dreamworks took care with their product. I read later that they shows preliminary screenings to test audiences of families who recommended Dreamworks keep the ending the way it was, with the handicap. Both the protagonist Hiccup and his father Stoic are role models who are very relatable. They may not make the best decisions but their hearts are in the right place. Hiccup is uniquely selfless and curious, even toward ferocious beats the people, the vikings, should be mortal enemies toward. The female hero and one of Hiccup's classmates is called Astrid. She is the \"son\" Stoic wants Hiccup to be, her having the makings of a true viking warrior in skill and mindset. Very unique, this film. She ends up being a large part of Hiccup's motivation for him to make the difficult and right decision as she and the rest of the classmates give their support and join him risking their own lives as well to protect Berk (their village) during battle, saving both the people and the dragons. It could have been a bit tidier in story and plot. Some deleted scenes would have explained the motivations behind everything that much more brilliantly. However, it's still a 10 for me.", "28 March 2010. Take DANCES WITH WOLVES (1990) and make it into an captivating 3-D fantasy and retain the haunting but melodic sound track and you have HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. The special effects are sharp and vivid without overuse and do not get in the way of the visceral storyline, but make for a great backdrop. The story, itself is handled with care with a nice set-up and a more careful cultivation of boy and dragon and the fascinating learning curve obtained by this experience and how it is demonstrated in real practice is smartly addressed by the middle of the movie. Even the ending has a slightly educational and emotive element not usually scene in most action adventure movies. There is humanity and there are the requisite JURASSIC PARK (1993, 1997) moments with man confronting/anthropomorphic animal in the wild experience. In same ways, this movie resembles the basic human, emotional, you versus them conflict premise from THE INCREDIBLES (2004) that made that movie so powerful and compelling.", "This movie is Amazing. I do not have so ma y words to explain How it made me feel. Love it, shall watch it", "I was bored and I wanted some light hearted fun movie to watch before I went to bed. What's better than an animated children's movie, right? So I counted on the IMDb's rating and picked this one. I'm so glad I did. This turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Now I'm only waiting to get bored once more to watch it's sequel. The dialogues were amazing. So many subtle jokes to grasp. I loved every bit of it. I hope the sequel stands up for this in every aspect. Also I loved the characters a lot. Very simple, straightforward personalities.", "As a person descended from Vikings, I highly approve of this cute, adorable, action packed, well crafted adventure of Vikings and Dragons! Simply a masterpiece. Favorite movie I have ever watched. Amazing musical scoring. The sequel isn't half bad either!", "For animated films, this movie is a masterpiece. It has perfect visuals, an amazing soundtrack, breathtaking scenes, a perfect story, perfect characters, and so much more. There's no doubt that this film is now a longtime classic and will be taught as one of the perfect animated films in universities in the future. Everything just went right with this one. It's so rewatchable, as well. This film is what makes me love movies. And that final fight scene- just epic. Awesome, in the truest sense. My only complaint is that it should have been longer- more time to develop the background and other characters. But overall, a great movie. It will no doubt stand the test of time as an animated movie masterpiece.", "It's just must watch. Animation is good. Story is good. Everything is good!", "There's no words I can use to describe this movie! This movie managed to be good for all ages and just keeps people suprised and not bored for the entire movie! The main character, hiccup is definitely an amazing character that is very funny and is very lovable! The bond between hiccup and toothless is also very good to watch and see!  Please do urself a favor and watch this movie because I have watched it over 5 times and I still love and will continue to watch it whenever I find it!", "The movie & story are amazing. The score & music are wonderful. The characters and storyline tie together nicely.", "Great movie for kids and adults. Reminds me when I was a kid all I want was a pet like that.", "Awesome . Worth a watch !!! The characters were well placed.", "I don't have the words. If you hate this movie, then I'm sorry, you have no heart. This movie tells the tale of a forbidden friendship between a teenage Viking and an extremely rare dragon whom no-one has ever killed. Berk is a land of kill or be killed, and Hiccup, a weak Viking boy and the clumsy son of the chief, wants to kill dragons like everyone else. But when he shoots down an ultra-rare Night Fury dragon, whom no-one knows anything about, its soul reflected his own. After befriending the dragon secretly and learning about the ways of dragons, he learns that everything Vikings ever assumed about them is wrong. Not only does it warm the heart, it is eye-opening with magnificent animation and blows you away with an amazing soundtrack. Every adult in the cinema did not even blink while watching this movie and there was even applause in the end. It deserves applause from families everywhere. A friendship between a weak young boy and a deadly dragon show the viewers about unlikely friendships being beautiful and peace becoming possible. The end also shows that peace can sometimes comes from the most unlikely of sources. In my opinion, this movie turned out perfect and I could not imagine it any other way. How To Train Your Dragon will amaze you, tug at the heartstrings and open your mind to things you've never seen!", "well its better than Hercules in New York.. Hercules was strong and stuff but there were like none dragons there, but this was filled with dragons and touching moments between a small human and a black killer. Really cute and heart warming, really. Well done! hoping to see more and more animations like this.", "What a beautiful story about bravery and the courage to be different. Leaves you feeling empowered. The most impressive part about this film, to me, was the Music.. It takes you to another place, transports you. The effects are detailed and well-edited.  Definitely worth the watch.", "Dragons! A perfect blend of animation and reality. Not so dark that kids can't enjoy it's and not so light its stupid and unpleasant for the adults or teens. Even the TV shows that followed the movies are amazing and impressive. Dreamwork's clearly doesn't let down on their animation or their story-line. Lovers of Animation and Fantasy will definitely enjoy this movie. The start of an awesome trilogy and a line of epic TV series. But if you're a parent and have tiny kids maybe this is to big for them, you'll have to check and decide for yourself. In my mind its fine, but i'm not you. Clearly taking an idea from the well known Dogs is man best friend, Dreamwork's decided to take that but make that boy a viking and that dog a Dragon. The story of how Hiccup, a young not burly viking who doesn't seem to fit in anywhere in his Clan. Everything he seems to do is a mistake but he tries hard to help his Clan and take down the ferocious Night Fury; a dragon that no one has ever seen but torments them along with all the rest. Hiccup uses his mind to fire at the Night Fury and take it down... later on when he goes to find it, he's unable to finish the job.  Instead he learns how to tame this not so Furious, Night Fury. Which luckily in this film is a dog compared to what a real dragon might act, Smaug per say. Learning how to tame this Dragon, Hiccup finds that Dog is mans best friend. And takes down a much more deadly beast.", "How to Train Your Dragon is about a young Viking, and son of the town's leader Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler), named Hiccup (Jay Baruchal) who has no perceivable skills that learns how to create a friendship with a dragon. His journey starts as he attempts to kills his first dragon, but instead, ends up taking pity on the creature and then nurses it back to health. He teaches himself about the dragon race and applies it to the dragon that he affectionately names Toothless. The pair then take Hiccup's friend Astrid (America Ferrera), who believes that Toothless is dangerous, on a little ride to teach her about the dragons. They then find an alpha dragon that terrorizes all of the others in the area. After some time, the alpha is taken down and all the townsfolk believe that they too can become friends with dragons.The story is about creating friendships in the most unlikely places. After Hiccup takes down Toothless with a catapult and finds him in the woods, he realizes that he can't just kill the creature. He lets him go, but then finds him later on and figures out that Toothless can no longer fly correctly. This fuels his compassion for the dragon and thus starts the friendship. As time goes on, Toothless reciprocates this by protecting Hiccup from multiple perceived threats, such as Astrid or the other dragons. Toothless and Hiccup always have each other's backs and they help teach others that it's possible to create friendships between two species. Movies with similar themes include Guardians of the Galaxy, Bolt, and Shrek. All are family friendly, and show that friendships can be created over many mediums and that they are very powerful. One technique that was very relevant to the film was the use of montages. This helped to show the development of a friendship between Toothless and Hiccup. It also demonstrated how Hiccup learned about the different quirks of dragons and their usefulness in creating trust. Another useful technique was the use of color. Because of how bright and colorful the movie was, it kept children's' attention throughout the movie. It also added a useful effect for many scenes. When Hiccup was working with Toothless, everything was nice, bright, and used colors like green to convey a happier tone. When Hiccup was with his training partners, everything seemed to be brown and bland except for the dragons themselves. When getting into contact with the alpha dragon and in the fighting scenes, the color was dark, with a lot of grays and black. From montages, to the use of different color schemes, this all helped to show that friendship can be created in the most unlikely places.", "When the majority of people hear about an animated movie involving dragons and vikings, they generally believe that it is a children's movie, but in this fire-breathing adventure even parents can't help but be sucked into the story! These days it's hard to find a movie that everyone in the family can enjoy, but How to Train Your Dragon is an exception. With its clever script, heart-racing story, and epic soundtrack, families will be able to enjoy this adventure together. Our story focuses on a viking teenager named, Hiccup. He is your typical underdog who nobody singles out to be a hero. There's a girl that he longs for, recognition he dreams of, and courage he wishes he had. And in order to get all those things, he has to kill a dragon. This is a \"right of passage\"to his clan, and Hiccup has yet to prove himself. But during another raid from the dragons he decides to go and show everyone, especially Stoik, the clan leader and Hiccup's father, that he can be a true viking. In the process, he shoots down a dragon. But when he finds it injured, tangled up and helplessly looking at him, he has a change of heart and sets the creature free. During the following days and weeks, Hiccup visits and befriends the injured dragon, and names him Toothless. At the same time, he is put into Dragon School, which sole purpose is to train vikings how to kill dragons. Conflicted by what his people expect and what he feels inside, Hiccup must decide what path he will pursue. Follow in his father's footsteps or continue with his forbidden friendship. This is a movie that can entertain all generations, not just the youngsters. Some of the one-liners in the script are unforgettable and engaging. An example of this is when Stoik gives Hiccup a helmet to use, and tells him it is half of his mother's breastplate. \"Matching set.\"Stoik says, pointing to his own helmet. In another scene, the viking clan is preparing their attack on the dragon's nest and Stoik says to another viking, \"When that mountain cracks open, all heck will break loose.\" The other warrior replies, \"And my undies! Good thing I brought extras!\" Another thing that makes the script clever is the plot. While most movies are predictable with their plot, this one has many loops and twists that continue to engage viewers throughout the entire story. For example, in the film the dragon's island has never been found by any viking, but suddenly while flying around the viking island, Toothless begins flying away and leads Hiccup to the unfindable nest. While on the island, another twist occurs. While they are on the other island, they find an unearthly dragon that no one has ever seen before, that is larger than many viking ships. The ultimate twister though, happens at the end of the story. Unfortunately at the conclusion of the last battle, instead of coming out fine, our hero is injured and handicapped. One of the things that make this film fantastic is how the music captivates the viewer. The music and the score invoke emotion, excitement, and energy making viewers feel like they are soaring with the fire breathing creatures themselves. Many movies have their own theme songs that instantly bring emotion and feeling to the audience, and composer John Powell does just that with his inspirational piece of music entitled, \"Test Drive\". Directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders do an excellent job of enthralling the audience with the heart-racing story by different captivating scenes. One example of this is right from the start of the movie. After some brief dialogue, we are thrown into a flurry of fire and yelling as the dragons begin to attack the Viking village. Another example of this is when Hiccup is test flying Toothless, but in the process they stall and begin falling helplessly towards the sea. This may not be your typical date night action thriller or chick flick, but at least it isn't like watching Teletubbies or Barney. So, if you are looking for a good movie to watch as a family, that will entertain and inspire, this movie is the one for you. Your kids will likely be wanting a stuffed animal dragon for the rest of the month. But in all reality it will be a classic that your children will love watching again and again.", "I absolutely love this movie. This is my second favorite movie of all time. However if I am looking at this movie objectively there are a few flaws: The movie can be tonally inconsistent (one minute it is quite serious the next they are cracking jokes although the humor is very good), The animation while glorious for it's time and still very good by today's standards is a bit dated now that it's much more well animated sequel is out, There are quite a few plot conveniences and one giant plot hole. Now that that unpleasantness is out of the way I can talk about what is good: The writing is mostly excellent (these are some of the most three dimensional characters I have ever seen in my life, I can relate to the main character very easily), The voice acting is terrific (yes I know the accents are weird but I cannot imagine anybody else voicing these characters), the action is terrific, I have HEARD that the 3d is the best in existence and I do not doubt it, the cinematography is amazing, the pacing is terrific, the attention to detail is spectacular and this is the best musical score in existence. This is an amazing movie that focuses on the characters instead of the action. It is not afraid to take risks. I am giving this movie an instant classic award.", "There are so many good things I can say about this film. Most of the things I could say have already been said and thoroughly explored. Despite that I'm going to say them anyway. How to Train Your Dragon is a fun and heartwarming movie about a boy and the forbidden friendship he creates with a dragon in Viking Times. It's such a simple plot and has seemed to be done many times however it just seems to work so well in this film its not hard to get pulled in. The Visuals are absolutely stunning and magnificent. They are so beautiful and detailed its hard not to fall in love with the setting. The flying scenes are just spectacular. If you ever get a chance to see it in 3D jump on that opportunity.  The voice acting is honestly very well and sometimes extremely funny. I love Jay Baruchel's quirky voice that really doesn't sound like an 11 year old boy, but works so well. The Visuals are enhanced by the epic score backing it up. John Powell, the composer, is an extremely talented arranger and composer he really makes the movie with his soundtrack of brilliance that almost reminds you of the magic of Harry Potter and the epic-ness of Jurassic Park. This movie is amazing and it is probably one of my favorite animated films ever and I would suggest it to those of you looking for a fun movie with lots of atmosphere.", "How to train your dragon is an interesting film.It is about a young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the becomes friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed.The name of the dragon is Toothless.The young viking lived in the North on the Island of Berk.The way how he finds the is that he finds this dragon is when he went to the forest he sees it flying. Then he makes a small sound.Then the dragon find him.Then he give a fish to the dragon.Then the dragon understands that the young viking is kind.Then the dragon and the young viking becomes friends.Then he learns how to control the dragon.Then in the school where learns how to be a viking.All young viking fight with the dragons .", "There is nothing you can not find in this movie, a perfect mix of comedy and adventure, has some of the best action sequences and then it also has its sad and touching moments to keep you moving. Spectacular visuals and story line make every moment a treat to watch, making it an epic. The story is set in the land of Vikings, who are rough, fearless and strong people, and kill dragons (really ?) to save their city. Then there is a Viking boy, Hiccup, who does not kill a dragon he captures and later becomes friend with it, whom he names as Toothless. Apart from them, there are many characters, playing very important roles in the movie. The movie contains brilliant graphics and astonishing visuals but the main power lies in its plot. The impressive characters and the storyline is the heart of the movie. Though it does not give much time to the characters to grow up in our heart, but that's justified for the pace of the movie and the huge variety of things it provides. There are happy moments, there are sad moments but I can guarantee that there is not a single dull moment in the whole film.  We may have seen such a story of friendship between a human and a beast before, but somehow this movie still manages to look fresh and keep us constantly engaged in its plot. Overall the result is fun and thrilling, and mix of mind blowing visuals and comedy will surely keep audiences of all ages entertained. A must watch for all !", "This is awesome......a very good movie for the age group 6 to 12 years.It is a heartwarming tale about a small boy in the viking band who refuses to hunt or kill dragons.He finds a dragon to be friendly and befriends it without his father's knowledge.He also has a crush on a girl - the normal children's movie type. But this movie is special.It is a great pleasure to watch this movie.These are one of the family movies which can be watched with your child on a late Sunday afternoon if you are feeling bored. When his father find this out,he gets angry and shouts at the protagonist.Meanwhile, a war has erupted in the city.I don't want to spoil the ending....watch the movie and find out....", "If any of you reading this review knew me, I have to think very long and hard about giving a movie a 10/10. Very few movies are deserving of a perfect score, that's because a 10 means a movie as very very.....very little flaws or no flaws at all, and this movie is just that. It is very hard for me to be critical about this movie....but I'm going to review it anyway. Right from the get go, it sets the tone and what the movie is really all about. Its a perfect introduction with fast paced action shots of the vikings of \"Berk\" defending their town from all different types of dragons, with Jay Baruchel (Hiccup) doing the voice over and telling you what being a viking is all about.  This movie achieves so much without being terribly funny, don't get me wrong, this movie has many funny moments, but it focuses on \"cute\" moments which i think they pulled off very well. For example: every time when Hiccup goes and visits \"toothless\" it's some of the movies most memorable moments. The animators pulled of the perfect look for toothless, making his facial expressions and the noises he makes as cute as can be. Hiccup and Toothless relationship is one of the most memorable relationships in an animated film and its very rewarding to watch.  All the characters in this movie are very ingenious, and creative. You have Hiccup, a loner, weak but smart 15 year old. Then Astrid the stuck up girl that is in it to win it. The twins played amazingly by Kristen Wigg and T.J Miller. Who are quite stupid in there own way. Jonah Hills character, Snoutlout who is like Astrid or wants to be like her, but just a little more......stupid, but also he adds some funny elements to the movie. And of course there as to be a fat one that knows everything. Played Christopher Mintz-Plasse, his character is very enjoyable to watch and listen to. As for the score (soundtrack) which is beautifully written by John Powell, it is one of my favorite scores ever written. I'm a big John Powell fan for his work on the Bourne trilogy. With this film the score is very....well its just plain beautiful, that's really only word I can think of. From the start of the movie, with the fast paced music, to the romantic flight scene where Astrid (Hiccups Crush) flies with him for the first time on the dragon, or my absolute favorite piece from the movie is when Hiccup flies Toothless for the first time. Wow what can I say about this scene. I was in aw when I saw this scene, the music fitted perfectly to what was going on and the emotions the audience would have been feeling. This movie is perfect from the inside out, from its storytelling elements to its characters and most defiantly its musical score, it will leaving you wanting more.", "This is a perfectly planned movie, everything is just perfect, amazing graphics, amazing story, and voices are chosen very suitable for the characters. I am sure that everybody would be impressed with the perfectness of everything, and I would give extra compliments to the graphics being so fine and realistic making me live inside the movie rather than just watch. Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders are a good example of how a teamwork should be. I would like to see a movie like this everyday, and can't wait to see the next movie for each of those directors. I am sure that this movie can turn to a successful series. The only thing I didn't much like is the time of the movie being so short compared to the number of elements that should have taken their time to be well seeded, but this maybe a budget issue, and nobody can blame anybody when production runs out of funds", "2010 was a tough, tough year to rate films; so many excellent films, it remains the most memorable year for me. Inception won out, but even with Tron Legacy and Toy Story 3, How to Train your Dragon came a very, very tight second behind Christopher Nolan's mind-warping thriller. Even now... I question that choice: in my top 50 films of all, this film comes a solid 18th (one place higher than Inception). I adore this movie. In a fantastical land, warrior vikings battle dragons on a daily basis, but one viking Hiccup is not like the others; he is meek and sheltered and instead of battling he creates traps and gadgets, instantly becoming a laughing stock of his peers and a disgrace to his father. But when Hiccup wounds a mysterious new dragon and begins to form a friendship with the beast, his world is turned (sometimes literally) upside down! I remember the early posters for this film. I remember scoffing: \"Hmpf, How to Train your Dragon? Another lame animation full of crude humour from the studio that brought us Shrek? Count me out.\" But then the trailer appeared and wow. Then I watched it and I was floored. For a ninety minute feature it is crammed with story and great characterization! The dialogue first and foremost is witty and snappy but never overbearing or obnoxious (something a lot of animation suffers from at least a couple of times) this comes from having genuinely wonderful characters. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel, probably now typecast for life) is not whiny or too hopeless, using intellect and unorthodox thinking to win out, and the film's core being the developing friendship between him and his dragon Toothless, which is both very powerful and fun to watch! I don't think I can forget their first scenes together on screen! Toothless, what can one say? Media has had a lot of great dragons in the past, Toothless is right up with the best of them! Somewhere between a dragon and a cat, his is intensely cute and fiercely loyal to Hiccup. They become like joshing best buddies. It doesn't stop there either, the supporting cast are excellent too. Gerald Butler gives a fantastic performance as Hiccup's father, the amazingly named Stoic the Vast (the father-and-son \"talk\" scene is actually one of my favourites) and even potential love interest Astrid (America Ferrera) isn't anywhere near two-dimensional. It isn't all fluffy cuteness either, the overarching story is intense; these vikings live to hunt and kill dragons, this is a war going on and at times How to Train Your Dragon does not pull any punches. There are some challenging, heart wrenching moments in the third act, and as such this film single-handed showed the world that Dreamworks Studios are capable of standing as tall (if not taller) than Disney and Pixar combined. The music is a soaring Celtic and orchestral mix, the graphics are often eye-popping (the sky and rock effects are incredible) and the animation on Toothless is to die for, the screenplay is tight and never wasteful and the dialogue is smart and refined. Dare I say it, nothing is wrong with this film!", "The Story. The Animation. The Characters. The Music. Everything about How to Train Your Dragon is done perfectly. I can't really talk too much about it because I would just rambling to the point of ad nauseum, so I'll be brief. The story, about a teenager who downs and befriends a rare and intelligent dragon, and the trials they subsequently face is perfectly paced and written. There is never a dull moment and each scene is shot beautifully and well lit. It builds in seriousness up till the ending, which is among the best in a \"kids film\" in many years. The animation is quite impressive and seeing this in 3-D and Imax is the truly best way to see this film. The flying scenes are breathtaking and will have you begging for more. each character moves and reacts to duologue and action like a real person and becomes much more relatable as a result. (Or as relatable as dragon fighting Vikings can be. The characters are not only effectively fleshed out but are very relatable as mentioned above. While some of the side characters are more so stock personalities, they are still of hearty stock and nonetheless enjoyable. The characters are also voiced perfectly, I can think of nobody else to replace any of them and do a more effective job. The Music. The score alone could tell this story perfectly, and it should have won the Oscar instead of \"The Social Network\". Without question. John Powell creates a mesmerizing score that brings you across the islands of the Northern Waters amidst the flow of strings, the roar of bagpipes, and pounding percussion that highlights this score. It is one of my all time favorite film scores and among the best for an animated film. Really, do you have any reason not to watch it? It's an hour and half of indescribable perfection that will leave you breathless. See it. Now. Are you still reading this? What are you waiting for? Watch it!", "How to Train Your Dragon has the same basic story that a lot of animated/kid movies have. Our main character is part of a group of people (tribe in this movie) but he/she just cannot fit in because they are too smart, or special, or hiding some secret talent that eventually makes everyone love them and whatnot. Hiccup lives on Berk, an island full of hulk-like vikings who live their lives to fight dragons. Hiccup, like you could guess, is not violent. He is scrawny and too smart for his own good. He is essentially an outcast. The one thing I noticed is how many people do not actually like him. Even his dad is embarrassed by him. He does not have a single friend until he rescues the dragon he initially caught in his trap. They soon become friends and discover that (you gotta love the tried and true formula) the two worlds could actually live in peaceful harmony. Jay Baruchel, who does the voice of Hiccup is funny and witty. He endows the character with enough pity that we still root for him without us completely giving up on him. He is supported by a fun cast with the likes of Gerard Butler, Jonah Hill, America Ferrara Craig Ferguson, and many others. The movie carries along at a decent pace. It plays like more of an origin story, with establishing the characters and area, as well as introducing us to the history of the dragons. The moments when Hiccup and Toothless (his dragon) are together are the best in the movie; flying high into the clouds while also adding a touch of humor here and there makes it a wholly entertaining movie that makes you really want a pet dragon for yourself. The animation is pretty low key for the most part until the climactic battle sequence where it really gets kicked into high gear, delivering a spectacle that is a feast for the eyes. In the end, How to Train Your Dragon is an exciting animated adventure into a world full of dragons and vikings. Though it has a pretty formulaic story, it makes up for it in its animation and fun voice-cast. So, if you're anxious to see the new sequel, (re)check this one out before you head to the theaters this weekend. for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com", "This movie here is a movie that shouldn't be ignored. The animation of this movie is stellar, the 3D was eye-popping, and the story; Don't get me started on the story. The story features Hiccup, a young Viking who's small and inventive but tries his best to fit in the crowd of Vikings. The city of Berk thinks he'll never be a Viking but a nuisance and a laughingstock of his father and chief of Berk, Stoick. But that'll slowly change when Hiccup catches a never before seen dragon called the Night Fury and frees it from his grasp. Slowly but surely, he starts observing the way of the dragon which will make him break the Viking \"Status Quo\". Can he rally stand out from the crowd and receive the things he desires? Watch the movie to find out!", "I watched 'How to Train Your Dragon' recently after the hype began to build for the second film of the series. Having not seen the first, I decided to give it a go. 'How to Train Your Dragon' starts off with us being introduced to Berk, a small Viking village that is constantly under attack by dragons. We're introduced to the protagonist Hiccup, as well as a few other key figures including Hiccup's father Stoic the Vast (the chief of the tribe) and Gobber, the one-legged one-handed Viking sidekick voiced by Craig Ferguson. The first third of the story is fairly typical of many movies - Hiccup is not the strong dragon-fighting Viking like the rest of the village and he struggles to fit in. He is also looked down upon by his peers and his dream girl, Asterid. The characters are funny and interesting enough, however the movie really takes off when Hiccup meets Toothless, a dragon which no one has seen before (called a Night Fury) and which Hiccup shot down during the most recent battle. Once Hiccup meets Toothless the dragon this movie literally takes off. Where you would normally expect comedy and light-heartedness from an animated movie, you are bombarded with themes of courage, loyalty and bravery. The middle of the film is particularly spectacular, with the animation and music being some of the best that you will see in an animated movie (and, if you enjoy movie scores, possibly ever). The film's plot also has enough in it to keep you on the edge of your seat. While not totally unpredictable, the final third of the film delivers some excellent action adventure scenes, and right up until the very end of the film there are twists that will keep you entertained and emotionally attached to the characters. Typically I am a Disney lover - I used to watch the magical 2D movies back in the 90's and loved some (though not all) of Pixar's work in more recent times. However, after watching this movie I can confidently say that there are very few Disney efforts that can match this movie for sheer emotional beauty, something that has gone missing from many films in recent times, and has been replaced with formulaic comedy efforts. 'How to Train Your Dragon' is undoubtedly beautiful, it will steal your heart and leave you inspired by the end of it. The music is second to none and the characters ooze courage and heart - and the last thing worth mentioning is that the dragon designs (particularly their faces) are absolutely amazing - original and very creative. Watch this movie as an adult - I don't think a child will fully comprehend the emotion built into this film.", "Or, stumble through their emotions and words haphazardly. Upon my viewing of this wonderful movie's sequel, I couldn't help be wary. And, sadly, I couldn't help but join the camp of fans who can't stand it. The reason for the first Dragon movie's success is simple: No was expecting anything from it. It's the same thing with Lion King, same thing with Iron Giant; though to be honest the first of these awesome movies is a mega-hit and classic, while the latter is a mega-classic. To me, anyway. ;) Hiccup is an every-boy. He doesn't fit in, makes snarky remarks to his Dad and villagers befitting of a sarcastic loser, and truly doesn't fit the Viking mold of big, beefy (and flabby, apparently) stature. His mindset is one that while not suiting him well with others, does earn our immediate empathy. We've all had a \"Hiccup\" moment in our lives. So, what's the appeal? Hiccup, downing an at-the-time completely unknown Night Fury, takes it upon himself to search the creature out and then finish the job. Cruelty is just a part of the Viking way, and Hiccup is at first and all at once incapable of looking at the injured beast he has wrongfully incapacitated. But, in a moment of expectancy and at the same time surprisingly effectiveness (making US believe it's unexpected) Hiccup sees the anguish in the animal's eyes and drops his down-turned knife, even as the dragon had adapted a calm acceptance in his eyes and resignedly laid his head down. Imminent death avoided from both parties (the Night Fury spares Hiccup after the twerp frees him), a few misunderstandings and curious stares later, the boy is working *to* understand his flight-delayed dragon pet/friend. His tail is injured from Hiccup's recklessness. Their symbiotic relationship is at first deeper then the emotional connection. They have to work to build a trust. Though Toothless seemingly forgives Hiccup and accepts his aid unconditionally to help him fly again, it is through ingenuity on Hiccup's part and Toothless's slight begrudging tolerance that makes their failed attempts turn into a high-flying adventure. Hiccup shies away from emotion, Toothless is distant and cat-like. But when Hiccup is willing to protect Toothless from his father, making him opening up to how much he cares for the dragon. When Toothless puts his life on the line by rescuing his closest, and only, ally. Their friendship is able to fully blossom; they are truly able to forge a deeper connection and not be so afraid to open up. This is especially true when Hiccup literally loses limb but Toothless assures he still keeps his life. The ending is perfect. No need for cheap sequels.", "Though it's only been four years since the release of How to Train Your Dragon (2010), I'll bet money it has a better chance of aging gracefully than most of Hollywood's animated output from the past fifteen years. Heartwarming and funny, the story is full of memorable characters, and themes about friendship and prejudice. Yes, the story itself is familiar, but the magic is in the interactions of the characters and their emotional journeys, not in the narrative itinerary. Also, unlike most of Dreamworks' current output, there is a delightful lack of pop culture references and bathroom jokes. The animation is beautiful and lush, from the characters themselves to the lighting and textures. This will likely be an animated classic. It certainly has more of a chance of being so than the serviceable but weakly written Frozen (2013).", "When I first watched this I started to cry, because of the heartbreaking bit when Hiccup risks his life for Toothless and the others. And I love the way the music fits perfectly to the scenes. But in the end I started to dance of happiness 'cause it was so lovely. Also I can understand how this movie was a big success, the story, the music, the voices of the characters and the friendship between a viking and a dragon. Those things made the movie to a BIG success. And I think the second movie will be like this one but just a bit better 'cause of the family reunion and all that. One of the best animated movies of DreamWorks!!", "Its very rare that a book to movie adaptation is this good, and in my opinion this movie is a lot better than the book that it was adapted from. This is not just Dreamwork's finest movie so far, it is what all animated movies should aspire to be. The movie has such a pure heart and spirit, the range of emotions you go through while watching it ranges from happiness to sadness to the goosebumps you get during the climax. Im going out on a limb here and saying that Toothless is my favourite movie dragon in the history of cinema. Move over smug, this dragon is bad ass and scary one minute and then adorable as a domestic cat the next. Surprisingly, Toothless is the character i connected with most in the film because of my experience as a pet owner. Anyone with a dog or cat (or other pets i suppose) will love Toothless as he is so adorable as well as being loyal to hiccup. You cannot watch this movie without smiling, laughing and sometimes even on the brink of tears. If you are a movie fan, you need to watch this movie. I hope the sequel is just as good.", "After hitting their first high with Shrek in 2001 & then another in 2008 with Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks Animation at last crafted their best feature so far that expertly balances the story & animation elements and unveiled it in the form of How To Train Your Dragon. Set in a mythical Viking world, it tells the story of a young teenager who aspires to become a dragon slayer but only ends up befriending one when the opportunity arrives and learns that there's much more to these creatures than he assumed. The story is wonderfully written & is even better executed by the directors on the film canvas, the characters are quite intriguing, the dragons are vividly imagined, designed & rendered, the humour is well-timed, the animation is dazzling & meticulously detailed, voice cast suit their characters very much, the background score by John Powell is absolutely magnificent and the whole drama radiates a surprising depth & warmth throughout its runtime. On an overall scale, How To Train Your Dragon is a fascinating blend of an engrossing story, intelligent script, gorgeous animation, captivating characters, excellent production design & wonderful music that promises a thrilling ride to its viewers & smoothly delivers it. A rollicking adventure for all ages. The sequel is desperately awaited. Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com", "I happened to find this movie and decided to watch it, without any expectations. I turned out, that I had missed one the best animations within last... let's say five years. The plot was fun and unique and the main characters were easy to relate to. Movie was well made, but I noticed that some of the facial expressions looked a little weird. But it didn't matter. As a complete movie, it's great and it's no wonder it won so many prizes when it first came out. I'm waiting for the sequel to come out in summer. If it's anything like this first one, I'm most definitely going to see it.", "People say this was the best animated film of the year, they're wrong...it's the best one of my lifetime so far. Not since Shrek have I been so in love with an animated movie and it just never gets old.  I'm probably being stupid by saying this but fans of the Inheritance books (Eragon) will find something to enjoy here and let's face it, it's better than abysmal attempt of a movie adaptation. Perfect for the kids and adults who won't find it boring or so cringeworthy and overly clich\u00e9d.  Looking forward to the sequel Enjoy", "I absolutely loved this movie! Best animation movie i have saw in my opinion definitely deserves to be in a top 10 of animation movies! I think that this movie does deserve to be watched if you haven't seen it, a brilliant family movie overall. The animation in the movie is something else, im in my 20's and i enjoyed this movie as much as i would enjoy a adult movie even though i do enjoy animation movies i thought this movie suits everyone and the story in the movie is very touching. I think anyone would enjoy this movie family, kids and even couples as i watched this with my boyfriend on a night in and we throughly enjoyed it. Thumbs up!!", "There are a lot of animation films and I've watched lots of them. But this particular one struck me as a very original and geeky movie. I loved the references and witty lines. It had a great story that was entertaining, funny, unpredictable and often recognisable in its details at the same time. Also, the soundtrack by John Powell and sound effects were strikingly good! The designs of the different kinds of dragons were marvelous and very original. This is a real feel good animation as it should be with a lot of meaningful lessons about life on top of it. I would recommend it to all ages!", "I have watched it about 30 or more times and I don't lie! I love it! I can really say it is THE BEST cartoon movie - or THE BEST film at all what I have ever seen! I did not wanted to see it in a first place but when I got hold of that movie - OH boy I fell in Love with it! Every time when I have watched it I don't get bored of it. And even if I know how does everything go I am still exited of every part of that movie! Honestly, If i would be insane I would probably tattoo it into my forehead or inside of my eyelids so I would see it all over again....", "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" may be Dreamworks' best computer animated film I've ever seen. Because of the great success of the movie, a sequel should be coming in the year 2014. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a suspenseful attention gripping film that invokes emotion and witty humor. This movie knows how to attract the viewer to make him/her feel like they are in the movie, rather than just simply watching it. On the island of Berk, everyone is a Viking. The goal, kill dragons. One's superiority is based upon the type and number of dragons killed. The island is full of rock statues that are lit up with fire during the nighttime. At first glance, the island appears spooky but it is quite peaceful when there are no dragon attacks. Obviously, fighting and killing dragons is no easy game. Led by Stoick the Vast (voice actor Gerard Butler), the island of Berk continues to prosper. Hiccup (voice actor Jay Baruchel), Stoick's son, is continuously laughed at by all the local people because of his inability to kill a dragon. One night during a heated battle between the Vikings and the dragons, Hiccup shoots and traps a dragon. Because of Hiccup's weak body and personality, no Viking believes him, not even his own father. Hiccup just wants to fit in with the others and be called a Viking. He is only trying to make his father proud. Hiccup develops a relationship with the dragon he caught just as a person would with a dog. The dragon becomes Hiccup's first friend and he names the dragon Toothless. Toothless is unable to fly without help because Hiccup had shot off part of his tail during the battle. After some time, Hiccup becomes brave enough to fly on top of Toothless and control his flight pattern with the use of a mechanical wing for a tail. The movie does a splendid job at showing the bond between Hiccup and the dragon. Because neither the dragon nor Hiccup trusts each other at the first encounter, the relationship slowly grows stronger and stronger with time. Hiccup continues to keep his pet dragon as a secret knowing that his village would kill it if they saw it. The most remarkable thing about \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is the director's ability to attract a wide audience. This movie was originally made for children; rated PG, but anyone can watch the movie and find enjoyment from it. Directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders planned to make this movie suitable for all ages by creating enough action for children and a strong plot for young and old adults. The script contains a decent balance between action and humor in order to keep the viewer entertained. If a viewer is expecting a gruesome, bloody, action-packed animated film, that viewer will not be satisfied with this movie. Should this movie be seen? Absolutely! There is no doubt that this movie was well done. This movie allows a viewer to reminisce on their childhood and ponder about the ability to do the impossible. Overall, I would give this movie an eight out of ten. Once again, this movie really shines through with its ability to display the unbreakable bond between a pet and a human. A total of 98 minutes of film, and a couple bucks to watch it; this movie is worth every penny.", "I will give you the mega-fast review (and rhyme with it, too!) Great animation. Stunning job with Toothless (the dragon). Really great storyline as well, really kept you into it without a dull moment. I felt like the story never slipped off the line, and it definitely wasn't the typical run-of-the-mill kid's movie... in some ways, lol. No spoilers here, though! Only negative about this movie is Jay Baruchel's voice as Hiccup. He has an annoying voice in general, WHY WHY WHY would you cast him in an animated movie? Obviously he couldn't pull off any sort of accent, as he had none. Just a bad choice for the lead role.  All in all- great story, AMAZING visuals, might seem scary for some kids 9/10", "Rarely in my life do I say that an animated movie is one of my all time favorite films, its only happened with 'Monsters Inc' 'The Incredibles' and 'Simpsons Movie' but How to Train Your Dragon is now on that list as well!  Why do I love this film? Well, pretty much everything about this film is genius! I loved the characters, especially Hiccup and Toothless but also the dad, the girl and all the other members of dragon training club. I also loved the soundtrack which was just beautiful and also the voice acting was superb. I also found the story itself superbly written and directed. The animation looks stunning and it really added to the realism and brilliance of this movie. The way we see the relationship between Toothless and Hiccup develop as the film goes on was superb. It also had surprisingly good action and great character development. This really makes me interested for what's to come in How to Train Your Dragon 2. This is a highly recommended film to ANYONE! It should not disappoint!", "How to Train Your Dragon is a 3D computer-animated comedy-drama fantasy by DreamWorks Animation that was loosely based on the English book of the same title. It was directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, the duo who directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch. It features the voices of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and David Tennant.The story takes place in a mythical Viking world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at finally gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer has the desire to kill it and instead befriends it. Hiccup is a failure as a Viking: skinny, inquisitive, and inventive, he asks questions and tries out unsuccessful contraptions when he's supposed to be fighting the dragons that attack his village. His father, chief Stoick the Vast, has pretty much given up on his teenage son and apprenticed him to blacksmith Gobber. Worse, Hiccup knows the village loser hasn't a chance of impressing Astrid, the girl of his dreams and a formidable dragon fighter in her own right. When one of Hiccup's inventions actually works, he hasn't the heart to kill the young dragon he's brought down. He names it Toothless and befriends it, although he's been taught to fear and loathe dragons.  Codirectors and co-writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, who made Disney's delightful Lilo and Stitch, provide plenty of action, including vertiginous flying sequences, but they balance the pyrotechnics with moments of genuine warmth that make the viewer root for Hiccup's success. Many DreamWorks films get laughs from sitcom one-liners and topical pop culture references; as the humor in Dragon comes from the characters' personalities, it feels less timely and more timeless. Toothless chases the spot of sunlight reflected off Hiccup's hammer like a giant cat with a laser pointer; Hiccup uses his newly found knowledge to defeat two small dragons and impress the other kids. How to Train Your Dragon will be just as enjoyable 10 or 20 years from now as it is today. Boasting dazzling animation, a script with surprising dramatic depth, and thrilling 3-D sequences,it soars!!!!!!", "This film is an absolute treat! From the film's atmospheric opening, with that great piece of music and narration, the film is really engrossing and an immersive experience. It's visually stunning, the voice-over work is great, the script is really funny and the story is very touching. I've seen this movie three times \u2013 yes, not as many times as some of the other people on this board \u2013 and I've loved it every time I've seen it. I was really disappointed when HTTYD lost the Oscar to Toy Story 3. I've seen both the films and HTTYD deserved it hands down. It's sad when awards are given to sentimental favourites rather than films that actually deserve the award... My favourite animated part was that of Gobber. Craig Ferguson's voice- over was just brilliant! I used to crack-up every time Gobber was on screen \u2013 the accent, the dialogue, everything was just great. In fact, I liked Gobber's part so much, I was sad it wasn't more in the film. I could see an entire film with him in the lead! The scene in which Gobber's listening to Stoick while drinking beer and then retrieving his fallen metal tooth from the mug, is particularly hilarious and very well executed. Gerald Butler as Stoick the Vast is also amazing. I'm not a very big fan of Jay Baruchel but he voices Hiccup really well. I do wonder, even now, why Hiccup doesn't talk in the same accent as his father and the rest of the Vikings. He just pretends once to talk in that accent but otherwise, pretty much, has an American accent. It would perhaps have been better if Hiccup also spoke in that accent. But that grouse apart, Baruchel does very well, especially while rendering sarcastic lines.  I have a feeling HTTYD's success prodded Pixar to make 'Brave'. The setting of the films is sort of similar and when I first saw the trailer of 'Brave' I was very sure the same studio that had made HTTYD had made 'Brave'. When I learnt the studios were different, I was actually kind of happy for Dreamworks for their success. Besides, Kung Fu Panda, HTTYD is a huge and well-deserved achievement for them. I am looking forward to watching the sequel but also a little wary that they'll spoil the magic and perfection of HTTYD by trying too hard to replicate its success. That's pretty much what happened with Kung Fu Panda. Whatever happens though, HTTYD is a fantastic film for all ages and preferences. Here's to more happier times with Hiccup and the Vikings!", "The movie How to Train Your Dragon is a 2010 animated release by Paramount Pictures. The characters voices were provided by Gerald Buller (Stoik), America Ferrera (Astrid), Jonah Hill , Jay Baruchel (Hiccup), and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The plot of the movie is a young Viking named hiccup, trying to obtain acceptance in his community the town of Berk. In the process, he creates a device to capture a dragon instead of killing it and captures a Night Furry the most feared and unknown dragon of them all. While training his dragon he develops a friendship with the dragon he names toothless and begins to understand the species. The theme of the movie is an emotional ride in the turmoil of a boy growing up and the challenges he must overcome. The emotional arenas activated when a young man is different from his peers can create interesting situations. The relationship with Hiccup and Astrid develops in an awkward fashion, as real life relationships grow and develop. The development of the character Hiccup is similar to the animated feature of Aurther and the Sward in the Stone. The characters both grow up and need to make adult decisions that others; especially their family, do not agree with. This is especially emphasized through conflict between Hiccup and the adults in the town of Berk. Lighting and fog is clearly used to reinforce the mood of the characters. The dragons are portrayed attacking at night in when it is very dark, and when the Vikings go after the dragons, the dragons appear to be protected by fog that increased the eerie affect of the scenes. The angles used to view the scenes are from either Hiccup's perspective or outside looking onto the situation. This animated movie demonstrates a gauntlet of emotional situations that any living boy could face, as he becomes a young man. The key is that the character Hiccup develops strength of character that outshines his small stature. The emotion displayed reinforces the ability of people to change in the light of adversity.", "Seeing as how Dreamworks Animation continues to become #5 of the animation companies and has worked on both traditional animated features along with computer animated ones. Some of them (Prince of Egypt, Road to El Dorado, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, Shrek 1, 2 and 4, Kung Fu Panda 1-2, Monsters VS Aliens, Madagascar 1-2) are my favorites and some of them aren't my favorites and were quite weak for the company (Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, Shark Tale, Bee Movie), although Megamind was pretty good even though it wasn't a masterpiece. Before and after those films, they made their very first take on a story the fantasy genre two years ago: A tale of vikings fighting against dragons, but only one person can make the difference to make peace with them. How To Train Your Dragon, directed by Disney animator Chris Sanders, is that story and upon it's release, it was hugely praised by the critics and had almost gained an 100%. First off, before I would review what I thought about this movie, I would like to say that I wasn't into the books or the first installment this movie was based on, but seeing the trailers really got me interested and have been wanting to see it perhaps during spring break of summer of 2010, the year this was released. My decision to see that movie was during the summer... only in a 3-D version with the glasses that I wore and saw the movie with much anticipation. Then, after the movie, I walked out of the theater, saying to myself, \"That... was... EPIC!!!\" Never, and I mean, never have I seen a CGI animated feature film so breathtakingly epic and I think that it's one of Dreamwork's best since Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The story is so original and is really quite simple: One of the worst vikings in history captures a dragon, during a battle between vikings and dragons, and instead of killing it, he befriends it. While he makes a bond with the dragon, he gains not only the reputation of the whole viking village in Berk, but his own girlfriend. Later, he realizes that everything he and the other vikings know about the dragons is wrong (according to the trailer) and has to make a difference to make peace between dragons and vikings and battle the most deadliest dragon in history. I really liked that idea as it did justice to the book it was based on (I read it later and I thought it was extremely good) with witty and smart dialog, some heartwarming moments, some hilarious moments and some dramatic, not to mention epic, moments while teaching a moral lesson for the children ages +8-12. Then, there's the action sequences with the vikings and the dragons and boy were they so epic. The opening was so dark and intense and I really liked it, especially the other scenes with the dragons and the final battle where Hiccup and Toothless battle against the Green Death (changed from the named Red Dragon in the book). OK, I really hate to make two sentences about why I think the action was great so short, but I'm just going to have to keep going right now. The strongest aspects goes to two things of the entire movie. First, there's the animation. It's so beautiful with a wonderfully detailed look of the viking village, the forest, and the dragon cave where the Green Death eats one of the dragons alive and the character animation is so stunning and very realistic with facial expressions on them. The best aspect of the animation goes to the character animations on the dragons with an excellent look. Then, there's the music from the great John Powell and given the fact that he did some good music from other animated films including Shrek, Robots, Ice Age 2, Kung Fu Panda, Bolt, and Ice Age 3, this is one of his best music ever made in a movie for kids. It has the Scottish and Irish tones to it and it successfully fits well with the moments in the movie which makes it's soundtrack so memorable to listen to. I also liked the song \"Sticks and Stones from Jonsi and I wish to listen to it every day in every month. The voice acting is excellent. Jay Baruchel did great as Hiccup, Gerald Butler (Phantom of the Opera) did great as Stoick, Hiccup's father, Craig Ferguson was so hilarious as Goober, America Ferrera did very good as Astrid, Hiccup's love interest, and others including, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller and Kristen Wiig did excellent as the other vikings. Overall, How To Train Your Dragon is by no means a masterpiece of computer animation and I would love to see the sequel which will come out in about two more years. Thumbs up from me!", "The story evolves around Hiccup: young, insecure want-to-be dragon hunter whose only cause is to impress his father and make him proud for slaying a dragon. That being said, movie reaches far from that. When you're creating one animation story, at least over the course of past several years, you see one grand opening with either background story or action ripping in. How to train your dragon brings kind a both. It sucks you into the story of present and past right in and you already know you want to keep watching it. Without further due, animations are mind-blowing. Characters are relentless; they're so different from each other that you begin to wonder where the heck could they meet each other. But, after all, it just clicks. The whole concept of characterization just fits right in with the whole concept of story. Writers were well aware that one slight miss-course off of the plot would lead to an entire disaster and they focused their full attention on unraveling the story by unraveling characters. They both dwell through same course of actions; as the story develops, so do the characters. They're colorful, funny, \"wisdomous\", caring, patient, loving (sometimes annoying, yes) that you just have to fall in love with them. I actually read few reviews that are stating that this movie is unoriginal: for God's sake it's based on the book! On the book! On the bestseller book! The story IS original. But, seriously, if you're going to make a movie about dragons, how much originality you can pull off in that area? The bottom line is: Movie is amazing! It's one of those movies you can watch with your wife, kids, parents, girlfriend, brothers, sisters, friends ... it's filled with comedy, \"cute action\", few drama moments and nice, captive ending to all of it. It produces one nice message by the end and I know that anyone who watched the movie felt something by the end. I, honestly, can't wait for the sequel and I hope it'll be at least as half as good as this one - even if it doesn't, I will enjoy it for sure.", "This movie was GREAT!! So motivational and spiritual. I believe we can all learn something valuable from this incredible movie. (Excellent family movie by the way..totally rocks) The plot to the movie had a catchy story about a young boy and his ambition to be a viking just like his father. After attempting to kill the most dangerous dragon in their village, he finds the dragon only to see himself in this large creature. Spiritually, we are all one in the same. We all come from the same universe and have learned along the way that one can actually learn from the outside world in which we do not seek. After thousands of years, we've finally come to relish the life we live :)  And we all live happily ever after...God Bless", "A fun, entertaining and actually moving story about a nerdy young Viking who isn't full of macho like the other Vikings, and who befriends a wounded young dragon. Both go through episodes where they learn simple but valuable lessons. Animated movies face tougher tasks at grabbing one's heart, because they do not have the advantage of live actors emoting (god emoting), so when an animated feature does work, and so wonderfully as does How To Train Your Dragon, it is a tribute to those that made this happen. The creative team including all of the CGI people, animators, etc. Direction is given to two directors, Dean DeBlois, Chris Sanders. So kudos to both of them along with the writers William Davies, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders. And of course to Cressida Cowell for writing the book.", "This is without a doubt one of the best animated films I've ever had the glorious pleasure of watching. When this film came out I (21) was at home on the computer and my Dad (47) and sister (20) came in to get me to come with them to watch it. I couldn't believe the enthusiasm because I had watched the trailer and the movie looked like another pathetic Dreamworks film. I complained all the way to the theater and tried to convince them to see something else while we were in the lobby. To my amazement this movie absolutely blew me away. I walked in with the attitude, \"I can't believe I have to sit through this...\" and walked out announcing, \"We need to see this again.\" EASILY the best film Dreamworks animation has put out. Even the scores in this movie are fantastic! Well done Dreamworks. I look forward to your future films... hopefully you can live up to this one. Aside: I realize this story is over a year out of date but the rating being lower than TS3 sparked enough annoyance to force me to log in!", "I remember reading, with growing anger, about some dissenting voices during the last Oscar ceremony who were whinging about Pixar claiming the Best Animated Feature yet again with \"Toy Story 3\". They reckoned that this should have got it instead but having seen it, I can't really see what the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong - it does give Woody and co a good run for their money and this is probably the best Dreamworks animation produced so far. But by sticking too closely to the usual story lines these films adhere to, it just falls short of greatness. Young Viking Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) has a problem - actually, he has a few. He is a constant disappointment to his father Stoick (Gerard Butler) who is an enormous Viking warrior. He finds the love of his life Astrid (America Ferrera) is way out of his league. But worst of all, his village is plagued by dragons in all shapes and sizes. But after an encounter with a deadly Night Fury dragon, Hiccup quickly finds himself becoming friends with the beast. As time goes on, Hiccup discovers that everything he thought he knew about dragons is wrong but can they work together to combat the village's prejudices and an evil far greater than anyone imagined?  Dreamworks do things a little differently to Pixar - for example, they get a stellar cast to do the voices whereas Pixar get the best voices to fit the part. Thankfully, \"How To Train Your Dragon\" has a fairly small cast and they all do justice to the film. With the small cast, they probably had a few more pennies to spend on the animation which is truly beautiful. This is possibly where Dreamworks have the edge over their bitter rivals and honestly, this looks better than some non-animated movies. Water and fire look much wetter and hotter than they did in \"The Last Airbender\" (which damning this film with faint praise) and I understand that the 3D is also much better. For my money, this is the best looking animation I've seen since \"WALL\u00b7E\". My gripes, in truth, are fairly trivial but they still distracted me somewhat. As my Scottish wife eloquently pointed out, the Scottish accents shouldn't have anything to do with Vikings from Norway and while I'm on the subject, the fact that adult Vikings spoke with a Scottish accent instead of a Californian accent like the children gave the impression of half-heartedness. The other let-down is the story which is yet another tale about a unlikely hero trying to be something they're not but after being true to himself, finds that he's more powerful than anyone supposed. In short, this is \"Kung Fu Panda\" in a Nordic setting and if that's what you're looking for then great. This is a really good family film, full of all the fun and excitement you could wish for and comes highly recommended. However, I just wanted it to move me like Pixar can and it didn't. But like I said, this is still a very good movie and one which you'll enjoy if you catch it.", "I watched this and \"Toy Story 3\" out of curiosity and to stay well informed, without any expectations of an actual high quality material. Imagine my surprise when my eyes remained glued to the screen and how soon I forgot the plastic-looking faces of some characters (common problem with with today's 3D animation attempts).  This film has just about the strongest (and even layered) story seen in animated features in decades and transcends the basic (kid) audience in every aspect. Not to mention impeccable animation, flight scenes and black \"dragon\" close ups in particular. Think \"Avatar\" meets \"E.T.\" but with some decent character development as well. In comparison the \"Toy Story 3\" is just an infantile plastic to the last shot unless you are bellow certain age. It's a sorry state of Oscar affairs in the Animated Feature category when a forgettable flick like \"Toy Story\" gets declared \"better\" than this masterpiece. Whether it was just a stupid bow to the highest box office number, old grudges or a refusal of a film with some intellectual and emotional depth will remain a mystery. This film will remain a highly respected work decades from now when \"Toy Story\" is long forgotten even by those who were young enough to swallow it initially.", "I saw it a few days ago in the morning, minutes after I got out of bed. I was having breakfast and a little unwillingly I started watching it. After 10 min of the movie I knew it was going to be great. One can easily become fond of the characters and dragons. But that is where we come to the first problem: the dragons do not speak! Even though that gave a more realistic note to the movie, it would have been a little better (at some parts even hilariously funny) if they would have been able to talk. The dragons vary from extremely funny to gruesomely scary. The final battle was extremely well thought of, but the main antagonist did not have a lot of screen time and I thought that he was a little to big and dangerous for the way he was defeated. That battle should have been a little longer and with more effects. The relationship between the black, extremely cute dragon and Hiccup (the main character) was indeed beautiful and it shows (both young and old) that the things we do not understand, or that differ from us do not necessarily need to be hurt or killed. The message is clearly shown. The music has fitted wonderfully and it had a great viking-like theme. Voice acting was wonderful and the casting crew did a great job (especially with Gerard Butler). This movie is made primarily for kids, but even the older population will enjoy it. A great way to start your day.", "Yesterday, I watched this on DVD. Can I just say that, I was completely blown away. At first, I was really hesitant to watch it because I thought the title was a bit lame but when I saw that it was on IMDb's top 250 list, I decided to give it a shot. I don't regret it.  It is just spectacular. This film has the right amount of comedy, drama and action. The animation was fantastic. The film portrayed anti-violence, bravery and the value of animals (even if in this case dragons). It is a perfect family film. It could teach children a lot.  Also, the ending was just perfect. It gave the right amount of happiness, loss and warmth. It was amazing.  Definitely a must-see. Just wonderful.", "A great animated feature about courage and difference and the need to understand why we do what we do. Or perhaps it's an extended metaphor for the way the always-hungry beast of global capitalism pushes us to exploit one another for its benefit and can only be countered when we recognize our similarities and collaborate for our mutual benefit.  Nah maybe that's a stretch too far. Did I mention it has dragons and Vikings in it with some ultra-cool animation? This animated feature has a stronger script than many movies I've seen.  The animation is state-of-the-art, imaginative and in some cases ground-breaking", "I don't think words can quite depict how good this movie is. I think of myself as a really harsh critic, but this movie really touched me. The only downside is the voice of the protagonist which in my opinion is plain annoying. Other than that, great piece of work. Recommended for everyone from 3 to 100. Great use of the emotions. Very well achieved effects. The motive of the movie is quite clear. All the metaphors are easy to recognize (specially at the end where the dragon and the \"battled\" kid walk together). Family friendly. The plot is simple, yet brilliant. Action packed at just the right times. This movie excelled in every aspect. I really hope they keep making movies of this caliber.", "A fun, snappy animated film about a young Viking who would rather make friends with the dragons preying on his village than hunt them. The universal message at the heart of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is one of understanding, and how the more you fully understand the world around you, the less you will have to be afraid of. The story is told with a lot of spirit and the animation is sensational, but it never manages to achieve that level of magic, the one that makes you want to laugh and bawl at the same time, that has become the hallmark of Pixar's animated films. Grade: A-", "\u00a8 You sir are playing a dangerous game! Keeping this much raw viking-ness contained. There will be consequences! \u00a8 The creators of Lilo and Stitch, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, bring us this beautiful animated film called How to Train Your Dragon. I had a chance to see it in 3D and it was stunning! I am surprised at how fast animation is advancing these days because the visuals were as good as Avatar in my opinion. The scenes where the dragons are flying over the spectacular landscape are just amazing. This film is not just about the animation, it also has a great story and memorable characters. The movie is based on Cressida Cowell's novel while directors DeBlois and Sanders contributed by adapting the screenplay making this a fun film for the entire family to enjoy. How to Train Your Dragon has a lot of heart, which is strange for a DreamWorks film. This one might have a chance at beating Disney in the Oscars for the animated category next year. The music in this film is also great; John Powell has already worked in several other animated films such as Ice Age, Bolt, Happy Feet, and Kung Fu Panda so he has great experience in this area. How to Train Your Dragon has raised the bar for the next animated films to come out this year and it will be very hard to top it, and yes I know Toy Story 3 and Shrek 4 are also coming out this year, but they will have big shoes to fill. The story takes place in an island up north named Berk where big and strong Vikings inhabit the land. These Vikings hunt dragons because they see them as a danger to their town. Hiccup is a young boy who dreams of slaying dragons, but his small physique doesn't help him in this endeavor. However, he is a great inventor and he has designed a machine that is able to launch a net that can trap dragons in midair. Despite of his brilliant creation the rest of the tribe do not pay attention to him, not even his father, Stoik the Vast, who just happens to be the village leader. He is disappointed in his son because he is nothing like the other kids, so Hiccup is always trying to prove himself. One night he tries his new invention and ends up trapping a dragon. His father doesn't believe him so he decides to go slay the dragon himself and prove to everyone he is a true Viking. The only problem is that when Hiccup reaches the dragon he can't kill it and ends up freeing him. Stoik decides to send his son to a Viking school where they teach small Vikings how to slay these terrible beasts. Hiccup ends up finding the dragon he freed and discovers that these creatures are not as frightening as everyone else believes. He begins a friendship with the dragon which he names Toothless (he was actually inspired by Stitch) and he begins to master how dragons think and act so slowly he becomes one of the best students in school. The problem is that Hiccup must now teach his fellow Vikings that these animals can be domesticated before it is too late. How to Train Your Dragon is a movie you have to go see with the entire family because adults and kids will enjoy it alike. It is also a film which is worth watching in 3D because the visuals are just incredible and at moments it feels like you are actually the person flying on the dragon's back. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I really wasn't expecting much from it and I didn't like the title either, but after hearing good reviews from this movie I knew I had to go see it and it was worth the while. I can't comment on the vocal performances because I watched this film in Spanish, but the translation was done really well as they usually are in animated films. This is one of those movies where some of the characters will stick with you in the same way Buzz and Woody did in Toy Story. The technological advances in animation from that film to this one are just astonishing. I still consider The Lion King and Up to be my favorite animated films, but this one will remain a very memorable one as well and hopefully some good sequels can be made. This is a movie I recommend you to see in 3D! You won't want to miss it.", "I didn't bother to watch this movie when it first appeared because I thought they made another 'Lilo and Stitch' out of it. At least, that's what it looked like from the trailers. I probably wouldn't have seen it for some time yet unless I hadn't been on a trans-Atlantic flight and had nothing better to do than watch a movie. Although I was watching it on a 4 by 6 screen with crappy sound, I have rarely enjoyed myself as much as I had with 'How to train your dragons'. Because it has just about everything I look for in an animated film: Funny. This film, unlike many, manages to avoid toilet and slapstick humor entirely, and that is already a huge plus, rare as that is. But the jokes that are in the movie slot into place so naturally, and are so well timed that I don't know of anyone who could watch this with a straight face for more than five minutes. The humor has something in it for everyone: visual gags, puns, word play, allusions... all but the aforementioned toilet/slapstick humor. Clever. Surprisingly enough, this movie is actually original. I don't remember any other movies with a plot even similar (Eragon does not even come close) to this one. Does the movie completely avoid clich\u00e9 situations and is it completely unpredictable? No. But the clich\u00e9s are few and extremely well done at that, and of course it's predictable. It is supposed to be that way. You know what the ending will be like. But at the same time, there are many interesting twists thrown into the plot, what's predictable is cocooned in humor and even some self-irony, and even the ending has a slight surprise which I have never seen before in any movie. Visuals. If I can be immersed in this movie on a 4 by 6 screen, I can imagine how it would've been to watch this on a theater-sized screen. Mind-blowing would not begin to cover it, especially in 3-d. Should you watch this? Oh, definitely. Bring everyone you know along as well, because I don't know anyone who would not be at the very least mildly entertained by this movie. It's not my favorite movie, but it's definitely in my top 20 or so. For a very good reason.", "If you've had one ear and/or one eye open to the media over the past month you've likely heard the masses shouting their accolades for \"How To Train Your Dragon.\" It is the highest rated Dreamworks Animation film of all-time in the realms of Rotten Tomatoes with a staggering fraction of 98% positive reviews. That also makes it one of the most critically- acclaimed films of the year so far. On a similar rave wave, it is currently ranked #174 on IMDb's zesty Top 250 list (just above John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\"). I wonder if that will last... With so much praise under it's wings, I went into my 3D screening of \"How To Train Your Dragon\" at the local Cinemark with soaring expectations. They were well met! This is the best product to come out of the Dreamworks Animation factory that I've seen since the original \"Shrek\" nine years ago (that said, I've missed and avoided more than a couple on their menu between then and now). This is one of the best films I've seen this year! But I've only seen four of the films that 2010 has had to offer up to this point. \"How To Train Your Dragon\" is based on the first in a series of eight books from the mind of Cressida Cowell. This yarn is set in a mythical world where the people are all vikings and dragon-slaying is all the rage. In this particular thread we meet Hiccup, the son of a viking chief. Hiccup does not fit it, and it may have more to do with his different ideas than his different physical make-up. He encounters a wounded dragon in the woods and- I'm not here to tell the story, but hopefully that appetizer piqued your interest. This movie suffers from banal characters and situations. While fairly predictable as a whole it still breathes out fiery instances of astonishment and even delivers a powerfully emotional punch or two. All in all, it is one solid piece of entertainment capable of stirring the audience's feeling. You'll surely laugh, probably hold your breath with excitement, and maybe even cry (my date did). As aforementioned, I caught the film in 3D (absolutely deliberately) and it was dazzling. It is the most beautiful thing I've seen since... well... \"Avatar.\" This is one feature film well-worth paying a raised admission price for that extra dimension, though I fear the days for such a chance are dwindling if not already doused. I still feel for the seven people on this Earth who never got see \"Avatar\" in all its depth and glory in theaters. They will likely never know what they missed. Some films are surely meant to be seen in 3D, \"How To Train Your Dragon\" is one of them. The dragon-flying sequences in particular are where our recent advancements in technology really shine. Movie moments showcased herein and in the likes of \"Avatar\" prove that CGI and 3D-application can help storytellers immerse audiences on a whole new level. It can work marvels for filmgoing experience. Regrettably, as with all power, it can be abused and used only for show, bringing nothing but nifty trickery for the audience to suck on. And lower still, some \"filmmakers\" are only using these abilities (sometimes as a last minute hack-job) just to get us in the theater seats. I beseech you all to go see \"How To Train Your Dragon.\" It is the only movie I've seen this year I'd recommend to everyone. You'll see all sorts of these imaginative flying lizards and the film takes careful time to introduce us to a number of them. Not least of which is Toothless, the name Hiccup gives the rare monster he finds one eventful afternoon. It is the relationship between this special dragon and this special young man that is at the heart of the film. It works wonderfully. If I haven't convinced you to see it yet then I haven't done my job, go learn \"How To Train Your Dragon,\" you'll be glad you did.", "Dreamworks animated movie tells the story of Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, heir of the Viking chiefdom, but a boy with one very big problem: a hero he is not. He hopes that one day he could slay a dragon and become a hero for his people and specially for his father. The movie is very good, the animation was excellent, already a constant in all dreamworks movies. It has very good humor and a lot of funny moments. It also has some very good moments of adventure. The story is very good and the plot was very well developed. It has a very good rhythm, the viewer never gets bored. The cast of voices was excellent. To conclude, How to train your dragon, will entertain you, you will enjoy it and you will end with a smile.", "Before I start, let me first say that I walked into the cinema to watch How To Train Your Dragon with no expectations at all. Dreamworks have been going downhill since Shrek 2 and the title of this film, coupled with a huge 3D printed next to it, failed to get my hopes up too much either. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is Dreamworks best film since Shrek 2, but then I realised that Dreamworks haven't made a good animation since Shrek 2. Oh dear. After a fairly dull opening, we eventually get to the main story of the film which is about a young boy befriending a dragon which is meant to be the enemy of his people. In fact, it's a lot like Avatar in this regard. The boy in question is Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), son of the chieftain Stoick (Gerard Butler) of the island village Berk. Dragons attack said village and Hiccup manages to take down one known as Night-Fury. Rather than finish the job though, the boy befriends the dragon and is able to get to the top of his dragon training class ahead of his classmate Astrid (America Ferrera). Other classmates include Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill. Already you can tell that the story is rather contrived and predictable with the only moment of true originality and laugh out loud hilarity coming in the opening scene in which dragons are burning down a village whilst Baruchel, Mintz-Plasse and Hill narrate over the top of it as if it's a perfectly normal thing to happen and they complain about their boring lives. Trust me, it will make all but the dullest of people laugh. It's not just the script that feels a bit contrived though. The directors Chris Sandler and Dean Deblois previously worked on Lilo and Stitch and it clearly shows because the dragon may as well be Stitch. The Scottish accents throughout the film all sound like Mike Myers from Shrek except a million times worse. Just get some real Scotsman for God's sake, why is Jay Baruchel playing a Scottish kid!? Just so Dreamworks can have a big name on the poster, JUST GET A REAL BLOODY SCOTSMAN! Actually, give them some credit they did get Gerard Butler and David Tennant but I still don't get the obsession with big A-listers in animated films. The moral message is also annoyingly unoriginal and so blatantly forced down the throat of the audience that I choked on my popcorn. How many times to kids need to learn the values of accepting outsiders and being nice to your father? The big surprise to me though was that the 3D was actually pretty damn good. The action sequences were also surprisingly well done for an animated film and these were (along with the funny opening I previously mentioned) easily the stand out moments from the film. It's definitely the best looking and most vibrant animation I've seen from Dreamworks. How To Train Your Dragon is not a terrible film. It's funny in parts and looks great in 3D with some really excellent action sequences. However, it's so contrived and forgettable that I really don't think Pixar need to worry. They've still got the animation crown and Dreamworks are showing no signs of grabbing it away from them. 2/5", "If you were a Native American, wouldn't you get annoyed by a movie, in which the supposed \"Indians\" looked like Maori and spoke with a German accent? The \"vikings\" in this film are a disaster. Vikings DID NOT have horned helmets. If they spoke with an accent, it was NOT Scottish. The vikings in the film wear clothes and armor that is completely unlike anything a real viking would wear. I know this is a child movie-- but why not put at least a fragment of effort into making the \"vikings\" appear at least a little viking-y? This all becomes extra irritating when the supposed vikings make references to actual Norse gods like Odin and use the ancient Norse alphabet. (Ancient rune-stones with such writing can be found not far from where I live.) As the \"vikings\" in the film look and act like... well, nothing at all (except they have Scot accents), to be frank, why put these references to actual Norse culture in at all? This just makes it even more irritating. The people who made this film could have checked out \"Hrafninn fl\u00fdgur\" for instance to get a little bit into the viking feel... But apparently even checking vikings out on Wikipedia is too much of an effort... I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie, because I wouldn't want them to get the impression that our forebears looked and acted like dwarfs from World of Warcraft. Yeah, its a fantasy movie. But vikings actually existed... Another detail that annoyed me was the fact that the adults spoke with a Scot accent, and the kids spoke like Americans. The story is also stereotyped, a predictable \"from zero to hero\" story that even a young child could predict with unerring accuracy. The makers of this film have seriously underestimated children, I think. This movie is not a complete disaster-- it has its moments. But awesome animation and a charming character (yes, the black dragon) doesn't make for a movie anymore.", "I was dragged to this by the child in my life and was both entranced and bored. Entranced by the special effects and the animation. Bored by the insulting-even-to-5-year-olds script. At my age, I've seen and heard this awful dialogue since I was 5 in many, many movies, plays and books and it goes like this: Your parents will hate you but go against the old daddy-plan-for-your-life anyway. Even though Daddy could be reported to a child protection agency for telling you \"you are not my son\". Ignore all the bullies and people who condemn you for wanting to be different. If you do all of that, the girl will finally see you are magnificent and forget her own career path so she can cater to yours. All the bullies will make room at the table for you and cheer you on. And best of all Daddy now repents and tells you he loves you. The worst effect of this dreck, to my mind, is that it simplifies life down to a pat little sentence for the children who go to it in droves. Rebel and the whole world will come around to your way of thinking, daddy included. If only it were so. 5 out of 10", "There's lots of very dynamic exciting action in this movie and it's mostly done with a cheerful fun tone most of the time even though there's still danger. However, despite that lack of \"realism\", I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. The effects and animation is stunning. Very well done.The story was entertaining to watch and it didn't really drag on like other animated films. One thing I didn't really like, is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it. Very clich\u00e9d and should have been better in my opinion", "I am rarely the guy who rates a movie lower than others. So let me discuss why. I will start with the main reason - the characters. I hate to compare movies, but I have to use some reference here. Take Kung Fu Panda, perhaps the new gold standard in animation movies. Every characters was interesting in some way. They were all captivating. Compare to this movie. I was not enthused with the main character. He was so...plain. About the only really interesting character was the female viking. She was a bit clich\u00e9 (the tomboy thing,) but she held my attention more than the rest. Then there's the plot. The underlying moral of the story is fine. It's standard now, in these movies, for some happy moral to be expressed. This movie is no different. And I have no issues with it. But the plot is almost non existent. The movie drags. I think because his interaction with the dragon drags a bit. There's the dragon, the training, the conflict with father, and the final scenes (where something finally happens.) That's about it. Now the last 15 minutes...great, impressive, inspiring. So 7/10 for the last 15 minutes. Pull out all the stops here, I guess. So by all means see this. And some people will enjoy more of the movie than I did. But the ratings imply this is really good, over 8 out of 10. Very high for IMDb. I am not seeing it. Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Robots, Cars, Finding Nemo ... all 8+. But not this movie.", "How to train your Dragon is good for so many reasons: It's fun for kids, the 3D is superb, the animation was cartoony but full of detail, the story had a lot of nice meaning, dragons looked pretty ruthless, plot was pretty awesome and what most surprised me was the beautiful cinematography. This movie felt like a real action movie for kids. By the first scene I knew it was going to be good. It was like watching the D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan except not as violent. There were fire balls and swords and smoke and people running and fighting. It felt like an action epic. This scene is were you learn about the characters and what different dragons there are and the different species were very well thought out so that they weren't stuck with the same old dragons that have been used since forever. The story is pretty good. Its about Hiccup, the son of a legendary Viking, however Hiccup has never lived up to his dad's expectations and feels like he needs to prove himself by killing a dragon. During a raid from the dragons, Hiccup takes one of his inventions out to try and kill the terrifying Night Fury, which has terrorized the village for ages and no one has ever killed it or seen what it looks. Hiccup takes aim and shoots the dragon down. No one believes that he has killed this dragon so he goes to find the body and bring back its heart for his dad. When he finds it its still alive but has been immobilized. Hiccup frees it and it runs off. When Hiccup goes back, he sees that the dragon has not been able to get out of this forest because its tail has been torn and it can not fly. Hiccup soon develops a friendship with the dragon and tries to teach it to fly again. And then the plot really picks up... I wont ruin anything but it does get awesome, despite the lame love interest. So I say go to this movie it is really great, although sometimes a little corny, but only a tiny bit, it is still a really great action/family/animated movie and I highly suggest seeing it in 3D.", "First off, I am in the animation industry. I can say without a doubt, this is one of the better films - not just animations - that I have ever seen. As far as animation goes, it's right next to Up in my opinion. I know that everyone who isn't a part of this industry associates animation with kids' movies, which is wrong on so many levels, but this is a great film for people of all ages. There's some kids' stuff in here, some adult stuff (come on, how many kids are going to get the DnD reference?) and a good message with an ending that's optimistic, but not just rainbows and kittens.  Visually, this film is stunning, with Chris Saunders once again creating an amazing slew of characters. The designs are original, the story is unique, there's an adequate amount of humor, and a good message. The effects are fantastic - the hair simulations alone are breathtaking, and watching the muscles of the dragons is absolute eye candy for a character rigger like myself. The animation was excellent as well - there was maybe only one shot that was rushed, and the research that went into researching how the dragons, especially Toothless moved, definitely payed off. The only thing at all that was off putting about this movie was the title, which only was kept because of the book it was based off of. I have to say Dreamworks, way to bring it up a notch. I could see this winning an Oscar if they finally beat Pixar. If anything, this masterpiece deserves it.", "This movie has the cutest and most awesome looking creature!! It's the BEST feel-good movie I have ever seen... twice! You could go with you girlfriend/boyfriend, your kids, your parents, brothers/sisters. Take everyone and you'll come out of the theater as if you've lived a 100 years!! Beautiful story, beautiful character development, and beautiful 3D animation. I wish dragons were for real cos this movie will make you wanna go get pet dragons. The story revolves around a young boy named Hiccup who becomes friends with a dragon named Night Fury and how they bond with each other. The facial expressions of the characters are great, the music is fantastic (really listen to the background sounds and music!), and the story itself is uplifting and moving. It will make you want to shed a joyous tear. What a great movie. Go for it TODAY!!", "Set in the mythical world of burly Vikings and wild dragons, and based on the book by Cressida Cowell, the film tells the story of Hiccup, a Viking teenager who doesn't exactly fit in with his tribe's longstanding tradition of heroic dragon slayers. Hiccup's world is turned upside down when he encounters a dragon that challenges he and his fellow Vikings to see the world from an entirely different point of view. Right off the bat, I have to say HTTYD is the first great movie of 2010, and it deserves the title rightfully so, despite of having a horrible and terribly inaccurate marketing campaign. Even a Pixar comparison wouldn't be a wrong thing to say. HTTYD is what all storytelling is about and then some. It's one of very few movies, with AVATAR, to use the 3D in such an amazing fashion to enhance the overall movie experience. In fact, not seeing this in 3D would be like having a BLT sandwich without the bacon, lettuce, AND tomatoes! It's not one of those films where the film was converted to 3D in hopes of getting more revenue from the consumers (I'm looking at you, CLASH OF THE TITANS and countless others!). Of all the Pixar films this can be compared to, WALL-E seems to be the most reasonable because of a character that does not say a single dialogue: Toothless. Toothless is one of those rare characters you see in films where you can understand his emotions and overall character just by his actions alone, and that's a pretty difficult thing to pull off, if I must say so myself. I also loved the father-son relationship explored in this film, which is very similar to that from CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS. The plot is pretty easy to understand but it's very complex underneath with the conflicting attitudes from the characters and the moral ambiguity, much like AVATAR. The film also has a wondrously, appealing visual style. There are some moments in the film where the images placed on the screen are so emotionally resonate and brilliantly perfect that they teared me up. The directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, seem to know what they're doing. The characters are also fantastic because they are authentic and very real. Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, and Craig Ferguson impressed me the most. My favorite character is Toothless, who is cute and charming. Let's not forget about the action and comedic side of the film. Unlike most Dreamworks Animation picture, HTTYD does not rely on pop culture reference and toilet humor, which automatically puts the film on the heap of the group, right? The action sequences are also well done and visually stunning. On top of every positive thing I have to say about the film, I must not forget the unforgettable soundtrack, composed by the great John Powell. The score is not used as a backdrop but as an enhancer to heighten almost every scene. In fact, there is on flight sequence where the 3D technology and Powell's score mixed so well that the hairs on my neck stood up. If there is one flaw the film has, it's the predictability, but I really don't count that as a flaw if a film executes it really well. Overall, HTTYD is a surprising delight filled with whimsical action, authentic characters, and near-brilliant storytelling, not to mention rendering the 3D technology to bloody awesome use. It's going to be one of the best films of this year. That's how confident I am. Watch this movie NOW.", "This movie is nothing you haven't seen before, but everything you want to see in a movie. You can't help but feel a compassion for each of the characters that, bolstered by the animation, causes you to laugh, cry, and gasp aloud. Here we have the typical coming of age story with father-son disagreements, special animal-man relationships, pacifist sentiments, and predictable romance-- such themes are no strangers to film. But this story in particular is stocked with pithy, intelligent dialogue and easy humor without seeming to relish in its own accomplishment. The movie packs in a lot of information in its too-short hour and a half. I wouldn't have minded if that time was doubled. Many others are comparing How to Train Your Dragon to Avatar. While there are obvious similarities, I must say that I found the characters in HTTYD considerably more compelling; I never came close to crying in Avatar. I also did not expect the slight twist in the ending here. I won't give it away, but it was a refreshing change from the stereotyped finales that everyone predicts before the movie begins (again, I'm looking at Avatar). Overall, How to Train Your Dragon is fun enough for children and intelligent enough for adults. This college student certainly enjoyed it, and was utterly consumed. I experienced a slight shock when I looked to the side and saw my familiar, non-dragon friends still sitting beside me. Anyone can (and most will) enjoy this.", "Wooh, well I just got back from seeing \"How to Train Your Dragon\" in theatres. I won't make this a very long review 'cause I don't want to bore you people to death with my blabberings. Plot: Very decent. A nice detour from the usual \"follow your heart/destiny/calling\" sort of films. This time the plot is a little more heart-felt than that. It revolves around the relationship of the protagonist and his father. Music: Honestly, I was too engrossed in the plot to pay much attention to the music..but from what I remember, it was excellent :) Cons: there were a few clich\u00e9's in the movie..but that's to be expected. The movie also did not have too many \"hilarious\" moments. A few laughs were had..but this is more of a drama than a comedy. Overall impression: This movie was quite satisfying. After going to see \"Alice in Wonderland\" in theatres, I was a little skeptical of going to see this one. It surprised me though..it threw things at me that I wasn't expecting. Recommended to: I would say..pretty much any kid is going to like this movie, unless they frighten really easily. Older kids and adults may have trouble connecting with this movie, but since I like children's movies, I liked it fine( I'm 19 yrs old). This movie was funny, touching, suspenseful, and action packed. Go see it while it's still in theatres! I didn't go to it in 3D, but the regular seemed great even without the 3D. So, if you're on a tighter budget, don't bother with the 3D showing.", "Oh a new Dreamworks movie... I think I'll skip. WHAT! CHRIS SANDERS IS DIRECTING! COUNT ME IN! That was my first reaction when I first introduced myself to How to Train Your Dragon. After the disappointment of Chris getting the boot from Disney after working hard on a film that I was anticipating with bated breath, I needed my Chris Sanders fix. And let me tell you this film did not disappoint me in the least bit, the animation was beautiful, the story was great (not entirely original but that is forgivable) The characters were real and likable, and you just got sucked into this whole new world for the duration of the film. The film pushed CGI to its limits and the 3D worked really well during many of the scenes, especially the flying sequences. I need to talk about the score... One of the best I have heard from ANY movie! So good! This is definitely a new entry in my top ten favourite animated films, and it may be a little closer to the top than I ever anticipated. Excellent Film! I encourage everyone to see it, I really think that this is a film that everyone can get something out of!", "As I've said numerous times already, I'm not exactly DreamWorks Animation's biggest fan. I feel that, aside from Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and last year's Monsters vs Aliens, their films symbolize the worst of mainstream animation, focusing primarily on cringe-worthy pop-culture gags. What convinced me to buy a ticket for How to Train Your Dragon, then, was seeing that Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois \u2013 directors of Lilo and Stitch (one of the few rays of light in Disney Animation's \"dark age\") - would be at the helm. Oh, and that 97% on Rotten Tomatoes may've been a part of it, too, admittedly. Whatever the reason, I'm happy to say that Dragon not only surpasses the duo's previous effort, but is also my favorite film delivered by the studio. While the premise of How to Train Your Dragon may seem tenuously related to that of other films of its ilk, the way in which it's actually delivered makes the whole movie feel all its own. The two main characters, Hiccup (voiced surprisingly brilliantly by Jay Baruchel) and Toothless, are incredibly endearing, and their relationship is unfolded in such a way that's nothing short of tear-jerking. It looks like the folks at DreamWorks Animation have been taking lessons from Up and Wall-E, as the most beautiful moments of the entire film are those without dialogue. Speaking of beauty, the use of 3D in Dragon is the most impressive I've seen in any animated film, and actually, rivals that of Avatar. Unlike, say, Alice in Wonderland, the film doesn't rely on the 3D clich\u00e9s of awkwardly bringing objects toward the screen. To put it simply, the 3D visuals enhance the story, rather than act as a substitute for one. How to Train Your Dragon, while including an engaging, character-driven story, is an awe-inspiring theater experience. While the basic story may not be the most original, what these artists do with it make it extremely lovable. On top of that, the characters are particularly endearing, and the visuals are some of the most impressive that I've seen in any animated film. DreamWorks Animation, consider me a fan.", "(Credit IMDb) Long ago up North on the Island of Berk, the young Viking, Hiccup, wants to join his town's fight against the dragons that continually raid their town. However, his macho father and village leader, Stoik the Vast, will not allow his small, clumsy, but inventive son to do so. Regardless, Hiccup ventures out into battle and downs a mysterious Night Fury dragon with his invention, but can't bring himself to kill it. Instead, Hiccup and the dragon, whom he dubs Toothless, begin a friendship that would open up both their worlds as the observant boy learns that his people have misjudged the species. But even as the two each take flight in their own way, they find that they must fight the destructive ignorance plaguing their world How to Train Your Dragon was a cute Animated movie, and considering the fact I'm picky on animated movies, that is a big compliment. However, how on earth did this get into the top 250? It's like Toy Story 3, clearly inferior to the first two, yet it gets voted in. Criticism aside, I really liked the story in this one. For starters, the name \"Hiccup\" for a lead is ingenious, and Baruchel performs the voice well. The relationship with the Dragon is what obviously makes the movie though. It's cute, believable, and a good story for the kids to get into. Also thought the ending was heart-felt, and well told. It's enjoyable as a movie viewing experience, but it's not as good as people like you to believe it is, in my opinion. Bottom line. I enjoyed this, I really did. It's cute, harmless, and it passed the time perfectly. Who knows, if more enjoyable ones come out like this is the animated genre, I might just get back into them like I used too. Don't expect a masterpiece, and you'll have a good time. Recommended  7/10", "As a movie itself, this is pretty good. But to say that it is based on the book? No. It is not. The only things the film has in common with the book are names and dragons. As a huge fan of the HTTYD series, this film is a real disappointment. I like the books because they view dragons differently. You don't have dragons as the good guys in many stories, but Cressida Cowell makes them into companions of the Vikings. I feel this film completely ruins the point of the books. Because the stories are so different, if/when they come to make a sequel, they will have to make up a completely new storyline. The characters are all wrong which makes it impossible to sympathise with them. Astrid isn't even a character in the books! For any fans of the books, there is no way I would recommend this to them. It destroys all the meaning of Cowell's books.", "I just came from this movie and I must say, my eyes are glazed over and I am working on a migraine. I thought I was going to die of boredom. I simply cannot jump on the bandwagon here. It is the worst, trite, lukewarm, spoonfed Pablum I have EVER experienced.  The standard messages: Follow your heart. Do what you know is right. Don't cave in to peer pressure. Your parents don't always know best. You'll be the hero, save the village and get the pretty girl to like you. I suppose if you are somewhere between 8 and 11 years old and still think dragons are cool, you might just get into this movie. If you are a slightly cynical adult are forced to go as I was, take some aspirin and just be glad you got to spend two hours in a nice, cool-air conditioned theater.  The rest is just not that great. It's ALL Hype, marketing and toy tie-ins. Think \"Up\" \"Ratatouille\", and the endless list of others.", "How to Train Your Dragon is a fine animated excursion into mamby pamby land for children but it is not so inane as to drive adults nuts. Those less critical of movies will certainly enjoy the film a great deal more than I did, but it is a fine movie none the less. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a scrawny and geeky Viking whose father is chief dragon slayer of the clan. Try as he might Hiccup can't seem to do anything right and his attempts to prove himself backfire and make things worse for everyone. He reminds me very much of Flik, the main character A Bug's Life. Both are misfits looking for approval and eventually they win acceptance by having a series of adventures where they learn to be themselves and teach a valuable lesson to the rest of the clan/colony. Hiccup's adventure involves a dragon he manages to bring down with one of his quirky inventions. Nobody believes him so he sets off in search of the dragon so he can slay it and win approval from his father and the rest of the village. He finds himself unable to do the deed and ultimately ends up befriending the dragon, which acts in much the same manner as a house cat. His experiences with the dragon allow Hiccup to gain valuable insights into the nature of the ferocious beasts, it turns out they are more like dogs and cats than flying lizards. The story is rather formulaic but it is cute, which is pretty much what you are looking for in this type of movie. There are several animated movies of a similar nature that I liked more than How to Train Your Dragon, Monsters, Inc. and The Incredibles come to mind, but it is still a movie that is probably worth watching, especially if you have children. I promise they will love the film and it won't leave you wanting to claw your eyes out, in fact, you will probably like it too.", "I liked \"Kungfu Panda\" and loved \"Ratatouille\", so please note that I am not opposed to animated, heartwarming stories about underdog heroes, even if they're fairly predictable like the former is. This film is not a disaster on all accounts, in fact it did more things right than wrong, but its main problem is so huge that in my eyes it became a total failure, hence the low rating. The problem with \"How To Train You Dragon\" is not only its predictability, its abundant use of clich\u00e9s with even the main characters, or several moments in the story when a character's coherency is light-handedly broken for the sake of yet another cheesy moment or even simply because the writers couldn't come up with another idea to forward the main plot.* The main problem with this film is its lack of rhythm which made it feel both hectic and stretched in the same time. Especially the cutting back and forth between the tender scenes with the boy and his pet on the one side and his fight-training on the other felt askew. Maybe in 3D it doesn't matter that much, because the brain is busy with something else, but I watched it in 2D. Maybe a director's cut could solve this, but I doubt that a director's artistic vision is something valued highly at Dreamworks. * the father-son conversations after Toothless' first appearance in public and before the final fight for examples.", "How did this rubbish get to number 156 on the IMDb charts ahead of classic movies such as Ben Hur? Must be a bunch of monkeys voting. As soon as I heard the Scottish accents of the adults and then, inexplicably, the kids speaking with American accents I knew I would hate this movie. At least try to make it *somewhat* realistic so I can suspend a miniscule amount of disbelief. But no, they decided to go with the stupid accents instead. Very predictable too. It's a typical kids movie therefore zero suspense and zero surprises. The Incredibles is ten times better than this yet it's nowhere in the IMDb top 250. Go figure.", "For a decade now, Dreamworks has had to carry the uncomfortable burden of playing second fiddle to that animation behemoth, Pixar. If this was a family, Disney's Pixar would be the older, ambitious sister, the one always doted upon and destined for greatness, and Dreamworks would be her cruder but sometimes more entertaining brother. However, the rivalry between the two studios seems to be fodder for the media more than anything else. Instead of stewing in jealousy or attempting to outdo Pixar, Dreamworks opts to stay true to itself and to fashion its own path to success; in fact, the studio could act as the protagonist in one of its own movies. With movies like the Shrek franchise, Madagascar and Monsters vs. Aliens, Dreamworks tends to aim for entertainment rather than art, simplicity over depth and the funny bone over the brain. For the most part, their latest film, How to Train Your Dragon, stays faithful to this trend. Strongly reminiscent of the 1999 movie The Iron Giant, Dragon employs Dreamworks's most reliable formula: that of the misfit underdog who ultimately gets his chance to shine and learns a valuable lesson along the way, usually on the lines of the ever-popular \"be yourself\" mantra of most kids movies. Though The Iron Giant was superior overall, How to Train Your Dragon does possess a lot of the same earnestness and heart as that film. The scenes devoted to the emerging bond between Hiccup and Toothless are the best in the movie, and their relationship feels organic and natural instead of coming across as a corny plot device. Toothless in particular comes across almost immediately as likable and, in nature, resembles a puppy more than a ferocious dragon. In addition, the animation is very well-done throughout, and the flying scenes, especially one that recalls the \"A Whole New World\" magic carpet ride in Disney's Aladdin, are as realistic as any. I didn't find them quite as engrossing as those in Avatar, but I'm sure they would have benefited had I caught this movie in time to see it in 3D. Still, even with those pluses, it is difficult to overlook the movie's flaws. The plot is predictably predictable, which would not have been quite so bad if the secondary characters had not been reduced to mere stereotypes (the disapproving father who only wants what's best for his son, the overachieving girl who eventually falls for the hero despite herself, the bullies, the comical friend/sidekick/confidant). While the usual pop culture references are thankfully absent and there are a handful of sharp lines, much of the humor and dialogue feels tired and wooden; the mostly lackluster voice cast does little to help. Furthermore, the movie strives to explore Viking and Norse mythology, but despite occasional shout-outs to Odin and Thor, this is all largely rendered moot by the presence of Scottish accents when they are obviously supposed to reside in Scandinavia. It's hard to really hate Dreamworks, though. After all, in terms of bug movies, I preferred Antz to A Bug's Life, and though I'm probably in a minority here, Kung Fu Panda was infinitely more enjoyable than Wall-E, which, for all its technical mastery, felt like an artsy message movie masquerading as something more accessible and less preachy. In spite of its faults, How to Train Your Dragon was a pleasant enough movie and certainly surpasses some of the other fare we've been subjected to thus far this year. It's no Toy Story 3, but it is something kids will probably love. Adults might not mind it much either.", "When I saw this film tonight, I was completely bowled over from start to finish. I have simply never seen a better looking computer generated film nor a film that used 3-D to such wonderful effect. Finally--a film that doesn't look like the 3_D doesn't look like it was tossed in as an afterthought--but was clearly intended as one all along. However, I will warn you NOT to waste your time seeing it in 2-D---the film loses too much of its artistry. Now I know some of you will think I am a total sap for saying this, but the film literally brought tears to my eyes because it was so beautiful. I simply couldn't believe how special and artistic this movie was--it completely exceeded my expectations. This is because the advertising campaign make this movie look like it's just another kids' movie--and nothing more. But, with a lovely plot, interesting characters, the best CGI on Earth, a terrific sound track and lots of surprises, this simply is a joy to watch. Nornally when I review a film I try to talk about the film's flaws...but I simply couldn't find any. At last, a 3-D CGI film that actually manages to be better looking than last year's \"Up\"! It is hard to imagine a film being any better--though I am sure five years from now, I will be seeing even better 3-D and computer generated films...and it boggles the mind! See this film! UPDATE: I saw this on a huge home television. While the wonderful 3-D was missing, the film still had the nicest CGI and was nearly as entertaining as it was in the theater.", "Set aside your opinions on how to train a dragon. We all know that every one has their \"favorite\" way. However, the kids will like this and it is a family movie so relax and enjoyed.", "After several years' interval I watched this movie again on our DVD copy and, just like the first time around, I loved this. I rank it along with Inside Out, Up, Wall-E, and Toy Story as one of the best animated movies ever made. What do these have in common? It's the combination of a good story to tell; engaging characters to root for; a clever script; and maybe most important, human heart and passion. HTTYD has the advantage of a truly original concept -- I couldn't remember seeing anything like it before. And as far as the story goes, there really isn't a single character in the list that we don't actually like. No villains! Just a conflict between a Viking village and the neighboring dragon population that turns out, in the end, to be all a mistake. Jay Baruchel perfectly captures the adolescent voice of young Hiccup, the misfit son of village chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). Hiccup is an apprentice to blacksmith Gobber (Craig Ferguson) and thus (importantly to the plot) knows how to make and build things. Like his friends, he's trying to fit into the standard mold of a rough dragon-killer Viking, but he's not really cut out for it. He is, however, smart and curious, and that leads him onto a much more important path. His peer group of teens includes pseudo-macho Snotlout (Jonah Hill), fat kid Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Ruffnut and Tuffnut (T.J.Miller, Kristin Wiig) who'd rather fight with each other than anything else, and of course the fierce Astrid (America Ferrara), who Hiccup would do anything to impress. The hilarious series of training sessions for dragon fighting that they go through are among the best scenes in the movie. The best scenes of all, though, are with Hiccup and Toothless, the Night Fury dragon he accidentally netted during the very first scene. Unknown to everyone else in the village, Hiccup sneaks off to the woods every day to train with Toothless so that they gradually bond together into a seamless dragon and rider team. The many flying scenes that go along with this are wonderfully rendered with animation that is exactly as good as it needs to be. The 2014 sequel (How to Train Your Dragon 2) is more lifelike and detailed, but that does NOT mean it's more effective. The essential thing is that the animation in the sequel leaves less to the imagination -- and engaging our imagination is what a film like this should be all about. The only thing that leaves us sort of scratching our heads is that the \"Vikings\" all have Scots accents (but only the adults! The teens speak in Standard American.) Nevertheless, it's so charming that it's easy to give that a pass. There are two other things that put this movie over the top for me. One is John Powell's music score, with evocative and versatile Celtic-style themes that actually stick in the mind. The other has to do with all the attention to detail that make the dragons more real and personable -- for example, the lovable way Toothless cocks his ears asymmetrically, or the way he scorches a little circle in the grass before settling down for a nap (a fun homage to the way dogs turn round and round before doing the same). Toothless has the full range of expressions and body language to turn him into a full-fledged personality. All of these add to the richness of texture of the whole story. There's hardly a single scene without perfectly timed humor, and the 98-minute run time goes by like the wind with not a single wasted moment. Kudos to directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders and to the whole crew for making a tightly constructed masterpiece. The one big advantage of seeing it first in the theater was the 3D rendering, which actually had real added value.", "I love animation, always have done, always will do, and I was blown away by How to Train Your Dragon. Granted, not all Dreamworks movies are bad, Prince of Egypt is one of the most stirring and evocative films let alone animated films I have seen, Shrek was very original and funny and Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron is their most underrated I feel. I will say too, How to Train Your Dragon along with Prince of Egypt is my absolute favourite of Dreamworks, and one of the best of 2010. The story is very engaging; there is nothing too sophisticated for kids and nothing too childish for adults. It is instead an intelligent, moving story that moves along at a good pace, and I for one didn't find it that predictable, and I loved the bonding scenes between Toothless and Hiccup which were suitably poignant. The script is also very strong, it is thoughtful and touching at times but also amusing when it needs to be. The characters are another strength. Hiccup is appealing as a protagonist, and Toothless is really quite cute for a dragon. Hiccup's father Stoick is a good character too, he is gruff and such but you can tell he cares for his son. The voice acting too I had no problem with, to me they did fit well with the characters, Jay Baruchal's excitement and enthusiasm contrasts wonderfully with Gerard Butler's restrained, gruff yet sensitive performance. Where How to Train Your Dragon really excels though are in its visuals and music score. The animation is outstanding, while the characters are modelled convincingly the real revelations are in the stunning flying sequences and the beautiful lavish backgrounds. Oh and the fight sequences are equally spectacular, haunting but also very gripping and almost epic. John Powell's score is a revelation, and one of my favourite scores in a film of recent times. Sometimes soaring, sometimes dramatic, sometimes energetic, in fact no matter what mood is conveyed, the score compliments it to perfection. So overall, there is very little else to say about this film, other than to say it is a must-see in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox", "This movie revolves around a kid HICCUP who wants to kill dragons but due to his weak physic as compared to others, he is always put on the back seat. The boy has a charm and is different from the others around which can be observed when even post trapping a dragon out of excitement during the beginning he is unable to kill him to prove his point and braveness. Eventually, his father gives him an opportunity to get trained to kill the dragons where on the other hand he gets close to the black dragon that he had captured. On getting closer, he observes certain characteristics of the Dragon and each observation gives him a learning basis his implementation during his training leaving others surprised. A bond that develops between HICCUP and the BLACK and CUTE Looking Dragon opens a gateway for the crowd to change their views on Dragons later developing an unbreakable bond for joint survival. This is one of the best animated movies ever made in the history of Hollywood and thoroughly deserves a humongous round of applause on every sequence. A Very Very Well made Master Piece !!!", "A rather impressive film if I do say so myself. This is truly a film meant to satisfy both children and adults. The story is great, based on a children's book I believe. Well done DreamWorks, bringing this one to life. I didn't see it in 3D, finding it distracting and unnecessary. Seeing a movie in 3D, after all, wouldn't change my opinion on if it was a good or bad film. As usual, the animation is delivered is beautiful, no surprise there. What really makes the film stand out is a well constructed plot. It delivers humor both kids and their parents will enjoy. The plot has a sense of seriousness that it carries with it, just consider the climax. And the voice cast couldn't be better, with Gerald Butler, Amerrica Ferrera, Jay Baruchel, and Craig Ferguson. In addition to them, there's Jonah Hill and Chris Mintz-Plasse! So obviously enough the talent is there and well used with great dialogue. Add some great looking dragons and magnificent shots and what you get is an unexpectedly rich DreamWorks film.", "This movie is just too good in every way. Most of the time the content/concept of the movie is good but the execution isn't perfect. This movie is just too good execution wise and the content is just to grippe to make u hold on to the seat till the end.  The Animation is just par above to all the other animated movie I have ever seen. My 2 other favorite movies are \"Kung Fu Panda\", \"Spirits\" and this 1 but in the end I would rate this movie as my all time best. The animation is just too beautiful, BRAVO!!!!  Just to add something more WALL E was a concept and a serious movie .. While this movie is basically a fairy tale and some lesson to learn from too. I swear this movie took be back to my school days and I was watching it as If I'ma 10 year old kid.  My only regret for the entire movie is .... Why the hell Did it Ended :( . I just could see it again and again and would not get bored, loved the Dragon and wish I could have a \"Toothless Pet\" . Its just too beautiful . Thanks for taking me back to my school days. I wish and hope that the directors and the producer of this movie just don't end it here as the Sequel would really be appreciated. I rate it 10 on 10 coz most of the animation movies now a days are love stories or about saving Earth but this one is just too nice to be a kid at the age of 50.", "There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It's incredibly well-conceived on an intellectual level, it is well-planned in the ways of art direction, lighting and photography, exhibiting a look that many live-action films can only dream of. The script is spotless, the idea is original and the talent is outstanding. (Gerard Butler is the most underrated technical actor of his generation, even when he keeps his shirt on.) Furthermore, it carries a positive message that young people should not necessarily follow in the footsteps of their elders when they find a better way. The only people who could object to that have to be Republicans or Tea Partiers. Finally, am I the only one who finds a resemblance between the friendly dragon Toothless and Stitch but also with Totoro of \"My Neighbor Totoro\"? It is wonderful to see that Dreamworks Animation has attained such brilliance after acquiring talent from Disney Studios and borrowing the best technology around. (Weren't those clouds in the 2003 live-action \"Peter Pan\"?) I was very impressed by the off-beat humour of \"Over the Hedge\" but this film's expressive animation just blows me away. Finally, it is very refreshing to see a film with a full spectrum of colours as opposed to the depressing blue-green live-action atrocities of the last ten years.", "How to Train Your Dragon is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen, up there with the three toy story movies. When they mentioned they were making this movie a few years back, I thought that this would suck. But by all means, this is lightyears away from that. This is about a a young Viking who befriends an injured dragon that he shot in battle. But as he trains his dragon, he keeps it a secret because he thinks his Viking colony will not approve. This is a great voice cast. I recently heard the same director and voice cast are on board for the well-deserved sequel. That bodes a good sign. The animation is beautiful. Over the past decade or so, animation has gotten so much better. It's unbelievable. I wish I saw this in 3D, but i did not. Overall, this is one of the best family/animation movies I have ever seen. I rate this film 10/10.", "Wow! This movie is a real challenge for all viewers (adults and kids) to make us take into account in what we can become. No \"childish\" movie (notice quotes here) has moved me like this since \"The Never Ending Story.\" I love the first half of \"Wall-E\" too much, but How \"To Train Your Dragon\" is completely good in every aspect. Even its ending was something totally unexpected for me to the point that it still keeps me wondering if it's good to show things like that, but then I imagine children asking their parents about that ending and I feel relieved. I also feel sad because \"Toy Story 3\" is out there and it can steal its Academy Award, but this movie deserves to be on the list of Great Animated Movies of All Time. It's time to start answering all those difficult questions that children ask us.", "I have seen this movie five (5) times in 3-D and now in 2-D or normal view. I enjoyed the movie in both 3-D and 2-D (normal view). When it is released on DVD I will be sure to get it the first day of release. It is well worth having. Great animation, excellent story, very entertaining. My mother who is 74(in 2010) loved this movie a lot and saw it with me every time I did. If you have read the book that this is based on by Cressida Cowell a few things have changed, thankfully she was not allowed to provide any of the renderings for this movie, her illustrations in her books are horrible, the movies cinematics are excellent and enjoyable. You must see this movie all will enjoy it. Today even some my mother's age said they liked it and had not expected too.", "This groundbreaking animated actioneer from co-directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders about a teenager who grows up on an island that flying dragons constantly raid is terrific from fade-in to fade-out. Basically, \"How To Train Your Dragon\" tackles the theme of intolerance. Hiccup is the son of an intimidating Viking warrior chief, Stoick (Gerard Butler of \"Gamer\"),and the Vikings have been waging a war with the dragons since the dawn of time and killing them. Nevertheless, the dragons keep on coming back to raid the island of its livestock and fishing hauls. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel of \"She's Out of my League\")dreams of becoming a Viking, but his dear old dad is pretty dubious about the prospect of his son having anything remotely to do with combat. Hiccup wields a small cannon with a projectile that looks like a net to trap a dragon. Hiccup doesn't trap just any dragon. The dragon that Hiccup brings down is an exotic specimen that his Viking ancestors have left virtually blank in their recognition manual of dragons. Eventually, Hiccup discovers the poor little dragon trapped in the depression of a lake because it cannot attain enough altitude to escape. It seems that one part of the dragon's tale fins that stabilize its ability to fly is missing. Relying on his ingenuity, Hiccup fashions a prosthesis so that will enable the little fellow to fly. Of course, all of this is like the scene in a venerable western where the kid tames a horse and learns how to ride it. Hiccup winds up calling the dragon by the nickname of 'Toothless.' When the dragon isn't prepared to chow down, it appears as if it doesn't have teeth, but Toothless does have teeth. Naturally, Hiccup's father is impressed when a fellow Viking tells him that Hiccup isn't the waste of breath that his father believes that he is. Indeed, Hiccup and his father sit down and have their first face-to-face conversation together because they have something to share. Incidentally, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" could be subtitled \"How To Train Your Father.\" You see, Hiccup's mom is only a memory, having died years ago. Gerald Butler provides the voice of Hiccup's father and he is a joy to hear. Predictably, Hiccup faces his greatest challenge when he survives all the tests in an arena with various dragons. All these dragons look ridiculous rather than scary. Anyway, when he is given the chance to slay his first dragon, Hiccup has to turn it down. Hiccup cannot kill, but he can make any dragon bow down to him. The 3-D effects are stunning. The formulaic plot takes on an entirely different significance with an ending that you'd NEVER imagine you would see in a kiddie flick. The generational gap that separates father and son and the prejudice that the father has toward dragons (the only good dragon is a dead dragon sums up his attitude) could be apply to anything or anybody who hates something or somebody because of the dictates of tradition. Sure, Hiccup emerges as the ultimate underdog hero, and Toothless is such an adorable little fellow. Picture the head of a catfish, the wings of a bat, the tale of a dragon all the color of soot black. You will want one of these exotic Night Fury dragons for a pet! This movie has many surprises in store for you, great action sequences, and a never before seen ending that contains more realism that we have come to expect from such a movie. Yes, there is a happy ending. Okay, some of the dragon sequences might frighten impressionable little kiddies.", "How To Train Your Dragon is another delightful addition to the library of CGI films, which almost always seem to receive more attention in the plot and story phase of development than live action films. Blame Pixar for raising the bar in this genre. Although it is from Dreamworks and not Pixar, HTTYD is definitely in range of Pixar's best work. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is the equivalent of Flick from Pixar's A Bug's Life in this film. Kind and creative, he wants to do well, but he just doesn't fit in as a dragon-battling Viking. Against the better instincts of his father, the Viking chieftain, he is allowed to enroll in a dragon-killing class with the other young vikings, including teen beauty Astrid (America Ferrera). Hiccup's fate is changed when he comes across a downed night-fury dragon, Toothless (who isn't really toothless), whom he brought down with his own strange weapon. Rather than slay Toothless he befriends him, and begins to learn the secret of dragons, where they come from, and why they raid the Viking village. As it turns out, it's not really their fault. Without giving too much more away, HTTYD is delightful and beautifully rendered. I recommend it with little qualification, even if I felt the third act was forced and some of the scenes of bonding with the other Viking teens were perfunctory. However I do have one major beef with this movie: The Shrek Effect. Every adult viking in this movie speaks with a Scottish brogue. Were the Vikings Scottish? I don't think so. It would have made more sense if they had said things like 'yumpin yiminy' or 'bork bork bork' rather than with Craig Ferguson's rich, melodious accent. However the whole Scots thing stands out even more due to the fact that NONE OF THE VIKING TEENS SPEAK WITH Scottish ACCENTS - they are all voiced with American accents. Is there some ginormous generation gap in this Viko-Scottsky village? Do they only get American television and music for the youth? I blame Shrek. Since Mike Myers' famed voicing of the ogre, adult characters in these things always seem to have been fed through some kind of Shrekalyzer to remind us they aren't Americans, they're furriners, but they're still good guys. Except their kids. Because kids never speak with a Scottish accent. Rant over. HTTYD is great. Take your child. The one that's not Scottish.", "yet another brilliant movie from dreamworks.its one of the best entertainers so far this year. praiseworthy at all levels starting from screenplay,the originality is what is most striking. although the storyline is predictable you never stop to think of it since their is so much going on. its like all genre packed into one bombastic family entertainer with out of this world 3D mostly credited to the exotic Scottish/Irish scenery and of course those fire-breathing dragons.the accent is so appealing so much so that you find it difficult to let go!! every character has a way with the flow of the movie.vikings do the thing they do the best!the morale though is simple but true--just be yourself and live in harmony with the animals. i hope dreamworks this time beats out any upcoming pixar movie!", "I had not seen the promos or the trailer for this movie. I saw that it had received some good reviews and decided to go for it. I was not particularly excited, but I must say, as soon as the movie started, I became immersed in it till the very end. The characters were so natural and the dazzling animation by Dreamworks studios is another addition to the long list of amazing things about this film. The film has a simple enough storyline but still manages to be refreshing due to it's intelligent packaging and presentation. The voice acting is fantastic, the background score is very nice, the editing is slick and the 3-D effects are beautiful. This is one of those few occasions when you come out of the cinemas feeling really good and getting more than your money's worth. It's a family movie, and an absolute must watch. Highly entertaining, Highly recommended!!", "Honestly, i wasn't interested with the movie at first. I know it is kind of a grand animation of the year but it just didn't attract me after all. It was an irregular Saturday where my cousin came to my hometown and spent his weekends with my family. My responsibility was to entertain him, it didn't sound that necessary, though. So we went to the nearby cinema and looked for a reasonable show instead of a 'popcorn' movie. We chose HTTYD because it appeared to most watchable among the others like Steven Carell's date night(preferable in dvds) and clash of the titans( me alone had watched it, don't wish to watch it second time since the movie has loosing plot). I walked into the cinema with low expectation as i was worried it might turn up to be some c+ level animation like planet 51. I have to say, this movie drills me from the beginning to the end. The plot is simple and the story is seemly predictable but it relished me with its stronghold bonding between the dragon-Toothless and Hiccup. There's one remarkable scene in the movie which vividly caught my like, the scene when Hiccup decided not to kill Toothless and freed him. It was a crucial moment where Hiccup could just execute the dragon and obtain desirable fame but he formed strong friendship and partnership with Toothless instead as both have solid conscience to understand what's best for them. Stoick effortly expressed his fatherly love to his son which touches me a few and how Astrid bumped to Hiccups entertained me hilariously. The graphic is as usual- great and it is more outstanding in 3d(although i didn't watch it in 3d, i heard the appraisal from my friend). I have always entrusted Dreamworks since their fame debut- shrek and Madagascar. A really great movie by itself, adults will like it and children will love it.", "Today I had the great pleasure of taking my daughter to see \"How to Train Your Dragon.\" and let me say this was another pleasant surprise from Dreamworks Studios. Besides the absolutely breathtaking background animations the overall CGI was excellent. Right down to the hair on the vikings arms.  The story was very simple Hiccup is a bit of a disappointment to his father Stoic, leader of the village. He lacks size,strength and everything the vikings hold dear. But Hiccup is an inventive child that had the fortune of actually downing a dragon during a raid. Toothless as he becomes known is discovered by Hiccup after he shot him down. The two begin to learn about each other and each others way of life. Much to Hiccups dismay he finds out that dragons aren't as bad as the vikings believe. Hiccup then sets out to help the injured Toothless and the two become fast friends. As Hiccup learns more about dragons he uses his skills to become something of a celebrity in his village.  Ultimately as usual the two are found out and Toothless is forced to lead the vikings to the dragons nest and to what has to be one of the most intense and enjoyable action sequences I've seen in a while. What really struck me about the movie was the underlining message of tolerance and learning through differences. True it may be lost on the younger set but for those who are a bit older the message will resonate, especially during this day and age. This is truly a must see movie for the entire family...Action fans won't be disappointed, comedy fans won't be disappointed and Hopefully Moms and Dads that have to sit through this won't feel like they've just had to dumb themselves down for an hour and a half. Dreamworks has done it again...Move over Pixar, there's some SERIOUS competition in the neighborhood!", "BEST MOVIE EVER. You have not lived until you have seen this animated masterpiece. I am not one who is really committed to animated films, but this is fantastic. I actually cried, and I RARELY cry in movies. Both original and yet familiar in its story, nothing has made me want to grow a beard more. Ever since Hagrid, I have wanted to own a pet dragon, but this movie has made me determined to find one. Seeing it in 3D is a must, the flying scenes rival those of Pandora, and from me this is something because Avatar is like my life. Also, buying the soundtrack is highly recommended. Warning: May cause impulsive jigging. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GO SEE THIS MOVIE.", "I had seen the trailer before i went to the theaters and i had found it quite good (i actually sometimes guide myself from trailers) and worth watching, merely because i found the animation great and i loved how the dragon looked. But i didn't go to the movie theater with any other expectation. God was i amazingly surprised! I couldn't even blink because i didn't want to miss any bit from the film. It was so amazing from start to finish (yeah, from start to finish). I saw it 3d so it was cool, but it is the kind of movie that you don't even realize you have glasses on because the movie carries you with it the whole time. Amazing animation, music, characters, plot and script (yeah i mean that); it was inventive (not the usual dragon stuff). Great directing, character development, funny from time to time and actually very sad in some parts. But there's a word to say it all... EPIC. God this movie didn't lack any sense of epicness, no matter which part of it. My heart was sunken and my eyes wide open the whole film. Yeah, i'll admit the relationship father/son has occurred many times and other things, but what is completely original nowadays in films? One more thing. This film is lovely and fascinating both for kids and adults (although kids might get scared once or twice ;D). It actually has a lot of message of friendship and to take care of animals and nature overall and it is presented in a way not only kids will actually want to take care of them. The flying scenes were superb, with john Powell's score and all (i cant get the score out of my head) and the whole movie overall. But my favorite parts were all when toothless was involved. I mean, when the movie ends, no matter if you are kid or adult, you want that amazing dragon as a pet. Tothless was amazing, and his development with Hiccup is so believable that you are jealous of that friendship. Its animation was amazing and he was so beautiful with his facial expressions and all. You know what? I'll just stop, because i fell i will never finish writing. This is a completely must-see movie and i want it to win the Oscar next year (yeah toy story, you have a superior now, and i dare to say so). How to train your dragon is equally my favorite dream works movie along with shrek (i'm beginning to doubt if i don't like HTTYD more, but shrek is a classic), and makes definitely my top five animated films of all time (well, without the 2d animation) along with finding Nero, shrek 1 and 2 and ratatouille. Masterpiece. No doubt i'm buying these and watch it many times. Very good job!!", "I had been hearing good reviews about this film, and that the 3D action was actually giving \"Avatar\" a run for its money, so I took the kids. All four. And they loved it...were riveted, even the four year old, who was also fascinated by the 3D spectacles. The scenery in the film was masterfully done, and you COULD feel the 3D essence. The story - not complicated - but an underdog story, and definitely a feel good story. Great ending. Very purposeful, I think. I thought it was the Disney guys (Sanders and DeBois) who did this because I recognized the names, but then thought...wow? Disney let them get away? Ha! Guess the joke's on Disney.", "I don't think I was all that excited, originally, to see this film. I've only skimmed the series \"Heroic Misadventures\" (on which this film is loosely based) and therefore had no real attachment to this. But I'm a simple soul who likes animated movies, and the animation sure did look pretty. I was stunned. I can't remember the last time I was this touched by an animated movie. Heck, I don't think I've been this touched by many movies of the \"any\" category. This is a story that touches on so many emotions during the course of its fairly simple plot--always a magic combination. Hiccup is the son of a powerful Viking chief of a little Viking village, but he's scrawny, sarcastic, and suited more for mechanical engineering than plundering and dragon-killing. Everyone makes fun of him, and his father is torn between shame of his son's failings and a powerful need to protect him from danger. Hiccup wants desperately to fit in, and uses one of his creations to shoot down a dragon. Which he then is unable to kill. Instead, he tames the dragon, fits his with a prosthetic tail fin (one having been ripped off in the original capture) and secretly helps the dragon \"Toothless\" fly again. It's touching, often hilarious, and simply powerful. This is simply a great story that is well-told and well-done with a mix of more static, silly characters and major characters with more depth. The emotions are incredible, and a rather bitter twist at the end completes the journey. The animation is beautiful and the score gorgeous. I can't wait to see this gem again.", "Normally Dreamworks, unlike Pixar, doesn't live up to my expectations. The last Dreamworks movie I had seen for a while was Madagascar 2, which wasn't that great. In my opinion, the best Dreamworks films are Kug Fu Panda, the first Madagascar, and maybe the second Shrek. Other than that, Dreamworks doesn't always score the way Pixar does. Their new movie, How to Train Your Dragon, while having an uncreative name, is incredibly well done in all aspects of an animated movie.  I was amazed at this movie. The movie literally starts with a bang. It jumps right into the action, without the build-up stretching out too long. The action scenes were exciting, and very well-animated. Was it just me, or did the water look SO REAL to you people? Anyway, I really liked Hiccup, the main character. Even though he's different than everybody, and the loser of the tribe, he's quite lovable with his little quirks and his sarcastic humor. When he and the dragon become friends, it had to be one of the sweetest moments I've ever seen in a movie. I left the theater, wanting a dragon of my own! Though I didn't see this movie in 3D, it didn't really matter. I actually had an adrenaline rush whenever Hiccup rode the dragon, Toothless, and swerved between mountain and soared over the clouds. May I add, I thought the dragon was adorable! Another great thing about this movie is that the plot was good; there were no plot holes that I saw. I never got bored, and I never took my eyes off the screen. The humor was great, too, and thankfully, lacking of bathroom jokes. This is a must-see for everyone. If you love sweet, fun, funny, thrilling animated movies, then go see this one. In the future, Dreamworks should look to How to Train Your Dragon when they make their next movie, so they'll have a reference to how an animated movie SHOULD be.", "I've seen several 3D movies in the past few months, including \"Avatar\", and I rate this one the best of all. The story itself was clever and original, about a young Viking lad named Hiccup who marches to a different drummer in that he's not your typical blood thirsty Viking but more an artist. Part of a young Viking's training is learning how to master the art of dragon slaying. Hiccup has an inside track on learning how to deal with dragons, and becomes what would be known today as a \"Dragon Whisperer\" (my term, not the movie). He knows how to make them do whatever he commands. However, slaying dragons is not in his ken, and the film's main plot centers around how to reconcile Hiccups pacifist tendencies with the ethos of the Viking Warrior. The 3D animation was absolutely exhilarating. I enjoyed this even more than \"Avatar\", if only because the story was good, unlike the tiresome boilerplate plot in \"Avatar\". I would recommend seeing this in 3D but lacking a 3D screen, go see it in 2D. It would still be excellent.", "I was simply blown away by the quality of How To Train Your Dragon. The script, the screenplay, the music, and the characters all culminated into an artistic show which is more than the sum of its parts. The 3D actually made it better (I saw it in normal 3D, since I remembered Imax 3D made my head hurt). InTru3D really shines in this, since the characters and background vistas don't seem like cardboard cut-outs, as it did with Avatar's Imax 3D. Also the flying sequences were spectacular. You actually felt you were flying with Hiccup and Toothless. The depth the 3D gave to the clouds and both the characters was incredible. I personally think Dreamworks' How To Train Your Dragon will give Pixar a run for its Oscar, since I believe it's better than Up and just as charming as Wall-E. If you haven't seen it yet, please do. You won't regret spending an hour and a half, in the world of Dragons.", "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a surprisingly great film. It has emotional story-telling, a great cast, beautiful animation and a story which can excite any movie-goer. When I first heard of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" I think we all had the same thought, another cheesy dragon film that is just another excuse to make a movie about dragons. Now lets be honest some the more recent dragon films haven't been what any one would call \"good\". However this movie isn't like the others. It's kinda like a talent show you always save the best for last and I'm guessing that's what the film-makers did. I was strangely moved by this film which truth be told no film has ever moved me like this one before. When I took my nephew to see it I had no idea I would be walking out from a truly beautiful film. In summary the story is about a boy named Hiccup who wants to be a dragon killer like his father and the Vikings in his village, however he isn't really the fighting type in the eyes of his people. So now he wants to prove himself to his father and his people by killing the most powerful dragon to ever cause trouble for his people. When he succeeds in capturing it he couldn't kill it. So he learns from it and other dragons that all is not what it appears to be. The only problem is convincing his people of that and learning what mysterious threat is causing the dragons to act the way they are and hopefully start a new and better age for the dragons and his people. This film dives into the commonly used element of father and son, we all see how he wants his father to see him as a Viking and someone great and the way it comes out is surprisingly heart-touching. It doesn't matter whether its in 3D or not. I haven't seen it in 3D and I don't care about it because I enjoyed this film a great deal without it. So no matter what you see it in you will enjoy this movie. Thanks to moving story-telling, a great performance by the actors, and beautiful animation fire has been breathed into the once almost dead dragon movie genre.", "I went to this movie because I love dragons, and I was hoping it would do the much-abused \"dragonrider\" genre a good turn.  I was not expecting *this.* This is something else entirely. This is a gorgeously wrought, stunningly good movie by any standards. I'm a college student, and I spent half of the movie with my mouth hanging open and the other half with a huge stupid grin plastered to my face. Here's the breakdown:  Visuals: the flight scenes by themselves are more than worth the price of admission. I'm not a big fan of 3-D, but this one time I think the extra depth really added to the experience; it didn't feel gimmicky at all. All I can say with regards to the designs and flight is: *somebody* did their research, and that somebody ought to get a medal. They got it *right.*  Characters: enjoyable and funny. I didn't mind Hiccup's voice at all; it really fit his character. The side characters are well developed and the conflict between Hiccup and his father is unusually well presented.  Score: stands out! Excellent use of...bagpipes? I've been listening to it nonstop since I saw the movie.  Plot: straightforward enough, but with a few really excellent twists that I won't spoil. Suffice it to say, the ending is very brave indeed and excellently done; I wasn't expecting it in the least but it makes the movie stunningly real. Bravo, Dreamworks.  Emotional connection and real heart? Yes, yes a thousand times over. I didn't realize how badly I needed a truly great dragon movie until I saw this. The bottom line: right up there with the very best of Pixar...dare I say with the very best of film-making, regardless of medium? Yes, I think I do. Welcome to 2010, everybody.", "How to train your dragon starts with a Village called Berk. The people who live there are Vikings. The main protagonist is Hiccup who is weak. They kill dragons but Hiccup befriends one. The they grow their bond between each other but his father finds about the dragon, toothless. He takes him to find the nest of the dragons but to his surprise the queen is never seen by anyone and is very strong. Then hiccup and his friends come to the rescue on the backs of dragons. This is an amazing movie, great script, stellar animation and the best score in any animated movie.\nTHIS IS A MUST WATCH MOVIE", "Until this film, Dreamworks had a reputation as Pixar's inferior younger cousin who just couldn't reach that standard of storytelling. Then How to Train Your Dragon came out and everyone was blown away! It has great animation, action, characters and story. The interactions between the protagonist and his dragon feel emotionally genuine. I loved it.", "I watched this with my kids by accident and it was great. Entertaining for both kids and parents. Of course you need fantasy for the kids but it has more deep emotions for the the grown ups. Really recommend it for a family night.", "I love this movie for one simple reason, the plot. I love the storyline of, \"Two individuals from opposing forces create a secret alliance/friendship until a third, more devious, group is introduced. Where they no longer keep their alliance/friendship a secret to bring the two forces together to unite ageist this new evil.\" That storyline is rarely seen in movies so when it does happen, I always love to watch it. The only other movie I can think of with a somewhat similar storyline is \"Warm Bodies\", the movie about the zombie and human couple who have a secret relationship and only reveal it when the time is right. Other than that, I love the dynamic friendship between Toothless and Hiccup, which starts out as a short lived rivalry, and ends up becoming a heartwarming bond between them. And as explained in the video, \"The Understated Brilliance of How to Train Your Dragon\" made by Grant Hodges on YouTube, the story has an interesting A and B plot when Hiccup begins Dragon training, but also learns more about Dragons through his interactions with Toothless.", "The movie is really good with all that Hiccup brings and finds what his true inner self is! This could have been a series like 'Trollhunters'. But it had its own spirit and brings a lovely smile relaxing smile on the face when you get stabilized.", "Epic and dramatic yet soft and heartfelt at the center. Note: Much better in surround sound.", "People lived on an island called Burke Island, and the story took place in a distant time. In the film, people still use cold weapons such as axes and knives. Blacksmiths and carpenters are important figures in the village and live on the island themselves. Think about it. We're living in a sea of cars, cars roaring past on the main road, tall buildings, and it's hard to even roll in the grass. There is a story of its location in the vast ocean, scattered, hidden, people do not even know if there are islands; It happened in a time so long ago that it was not even real; The people of the island wear thin, coarse clothes, whether it snows nine months or hails three months of the year; And there are dragons, from teenagers to the elderly, riding on their backs and soaring through the air. \nHow to Train Your Dragon is like a childhood afternoon dream, riding your own dragon to the sky. We are all waiting for the story to continue, never to end, as if the dream does not wake up.", "One of the greatest animated films of all time, and probably John Powell's greatest score. I have watched this many times, and I still get emotional. There are only a handful of movies that have ever given me that deep feeling of real magic- almost heartbreaking that you can't enter that world and live there. This is one of them.", "There's fun and jokes, gorgeous sceneries/animation, a fantastic score and sound design, as well as legitimate stakes and societal implications. Actions have consequences in this world. The ending is a bit too sweet for my liking but at least it doesn't wimp out like Frozen 2.", "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is definitely worth recommending. At least within 90 minutes, it makes me visually shocked and emotionally happy. In the end, I was a little touched. For you and me who are under too much pressure, this is not enough Is it enough? Seeing the integrity of his soul from the protagonist's physical defect. In the end, the combination of the dragon and the horse is also a kind of harmony.", "I really like that dragon. The story is very novel, raising dragons is so cool, and the father and son are also very loving.", "So Dane good! that I'll rate this movie 100% the dragons and people um yes, When i watch this movie my mouth starting laugh of joy that it makes you laughing while crying. \nYeah the movie was so good that they made 2 other movies that Went of the chart\nover 100% to 80% Rotten Tomatoes. \nMovie rate 10/10", "The First-ever movie that gets a ten in my books. I knew that it would be great because I heard all the things about it. But it was better than I expected. The plotline is so perfect and even better (10.72). John Powell's score is magnificent and the sound design is mostly on point (9.19). The visuals are incredibly as well. You know that it is animated but everything feels real (9.39). This is a movie you could watch every day and don't stop being excited. Overall; 9.76", "Still a great movie. Probably the most impressive thing about this movie is the fact that is has so many cliches that are actually well executed. The story creates a very creative and interesting world. The characters that it introduces are what really sell the movie though. Hiccup is a cliche character type but they make him interesting. Stoick is a cliche character type but they make him interesting. Astrid is a cliche character type but they make her interesting. The designs and unique features of the dragons also add a lot to the action. It also has some more emotion moments, as well as comedic moments, but it balances them all extremely well. This world is still fun but it's realistic enough to actually feel like actions have consequences. I really don't have any complaints. I guess some of the animation looks a little weird compared to the other 2, but this movie is only a 9 because the other 2 are even better. So in conclusion. This is a great beginning to a great trilogy.\nIt gets 93% from me.", "It talks about a weak juvenile hiccup that is different from the mainstream of the society, and finally reached a reconciliation with his father through peaceful dragon training, achieved the favor of the girl he liked, and also merged two conflicting social groups, human and dragon stand up. \nThe story takes place in a place called Bock Island, a place where the Vikings lived for generations. Bok Island has 12 days of desperate cold like the Arctic, and the Antarctic cold dying. The originally peaceful life here is often broken by fierce dragons. In order to resist the evil dragon, the strong Vikings naturally regard the dragon as a profession The protagonist is Hickap (hiccup), he and the tribe have lived on Bok Island for seven generations, his father Sturly is the leader of the tribe, and the Bok Island has been attacked by dragons for generations. Hickap wants to change his life in detail. He thinks that as long as he kills a dragon in two minutes, he can become a real Viking and even pursue a favorite girl. He has no strength in his hands, and he cannot fight the dragon unless he is reborn. \nBecause hiccups are weak, his father told him to stay in the house as much as possible. In order to prove that he is also a real Viking, he can also slaughter the dragon. Cannons are used to catch dragons. One night, Hiccup shot a Yesha (the most powerful and mysterious race among the dragons) with his cannon and fell into the forest not far away. Much damage. Father complained that as soon as he went out, disaster would surely come. Hickap, who was ridiculed again, wandered alone in the mountain forest and met Yesha who was hit by him the night before. He thought he could finally prove himself, but he did not kill the dragon at the last minute. Later, he fished the injured Yesha, and also named him \"Toothless Aberdeen.\" Slowly they trusted each other and became more and more tacit. In order to make hiccups stronger and learn survival skills, his father finally agreed to let hiccups participate in the Tulong class for training. \nHalf of the caudal fins disappeared when the toothless babies fell into the forest. Hiccup made an artificial caudal fin for the toothless babies to fly. Through continuous improvement, with the cooperation of the two, the toothless babies Fully mastered free flight. Through getting along with Toothless Aberdeen, Hiccups mastered the skills related to how to get along with dragons, thinking that dragons are not dangerous creatures and there is no need to conquer them by slaughter. In the following Dragon Slaughter class, Hiccup proved the point with the skills he learned. Taming the dragon all the way instead of killing the dragon, finally went to the final class-the slaughter of nightmares (a race of the dragon family), through After that, they are eligible to become real Vikings. Hiccup, the way to conquer the dragon, was welcomed by most Vikings. \nHowever, Astri, who was also with the Dragon Taming Squad, discovered the secrets of Hikap and Toothless Aberdeen. After seeing Wuyazai, Astrid was frightened and planned to run back to the village to tell everyone, but Wuyazai caught her, and Hickap asked Astria to give him a chance to explain. So they rode the toothless boy and went for a ride together. On the way, they accidentally encountered a large group of dragons, and were flying to their nest with the captured prey in groups. After following them to the nest, they found that the prey caught by the dragons was not eaten by themselves, but was all fed to a bigger dragon in the nest as food, and if the dragons did not bring food back, they would be caught by that. Eat a big dragon. \nIn order to protect Toothless, Hickap didn't tell his father about the Dragon's Cave. In the Dragon Slayer assessment, Hikap put down his weapon and tried to tell everyone that the dragons were not as evil as they thought, as long as they did not harm them, they would not attack. Due to the dispute between Hiccup and his father, he was reluctant to slaughter the dragon and was almost killed by the nightmare. Fortunately, Ziya had arrived in time to save Hiccup. The Vikings, out of fear of Yesha, captured the toothless boy alive. In order to prove the innocence of Toothless Adolescent, Hickap told the father in a hurry that the dragon's lair was found and that these dragons were also innocent victims. The matter became more serious, and Sturik planned to take them without teeth to bring them to the dragon's den. \nHiccup's father learned from the quarrel with his son that there was a dragon nest nearby. Under his leadership, the Vikings tied Toothless Aberdeen on the boat as a guide to find the dragon nest. However, when reaching the dragon's nest, the dragon was alerted and the Vikings suffered heavy losses. All the ships were on fire, including the one that bundled the Toothless Aberdeen. \nAt a critical moment, Little Hiccup led her little friends to ride the flying dragon to the Dragon Nest to rescue the besieged Vikings. Little Hiccup rescued the toothless baby with the help of his father. Little Hiccup and his father reconciled. He was very proud of having such a son. Hiccups rode a toothless man and started a thrilling battle with the dragon. Hiccups almost died. Fortunately, Hiccup was saved by the toothless man. Unfortunately, Hiccups lost his left foot and lower shin. \nAbout three weeks later, when Hiccup woke up, the whole village was filled with dragons. The dragon and the Vikings began to live in peace. A new era of the Vikings and the Dragon Alliance began.", "It's well established that animated movies seem to mostly be marketed as family movies. It is almost equally well established that such movies have shown to be just as nuanced, intelligent and mature as much or more than their adult-targeted counterparts. A lot of movies of this kind sort of let themselves down when by lavatorial humour or an over reliance on pop culture references or desperately trying to be down with the kids (not naming names but I'm sure you can think of one). But this is truly a case of an animated picture that doesn't feel like it was made for kids but just anyone. That you can bring your youngest room mates is just a plus. A nuanced substantial narrative of self discovery and how those you think are your worse enemies are people you should trust more (and vice versa). The Norse aesthetic is immersive (if not authentic) and the dragons look super. There is something especially enchanting in trying a more amphibian rather than reptilian look to its main dragon. The developing friendship between boy and beast earns every moment of sentimentality and the danger always feels real (something I always felt Fellowship of the Ring failed to do). I watched using the Polish dub (because Netfix lets you do that) and felt the voices were excellent The protagonist is very charming as an underdog that manages to win through unorthodox means. These movies of two sides learning to work together can be very hit and miss. I feel Miyazaki was always a bit heavy handed with them (no offense intended if you're a fan) but this manages to do it just right. As is typically the case with these movies, each character no matter how minor just oozes personality. And finally, the female lead is handled most pleasingly. I always like these formidable female characters and this one has developed nicely in more ways than one. As much as I adored the Lady Ghostbusters, I think the protagonist here needed to be male just so this dynamic could work believably. My only criticisms are the use of opening narration and that instant attraction with the tsundere. But overall: my father has gone on record to have found two animated movies that had genuinely resonated with him: Treasure Planet and the Incredibles. I am inclined to recommend this to him too.", "Loved it the feeling is indescribable!visually animation is stunning.story was Great the whole dragon fights was amazing.Music was incredible.screenplay was amazing engaging till end.the perfect build-up of fights and that ending fight was amazing.Overall its lovely entertaining Masterpiece!", "When Dreamworks nails it, it nails it good. Few animated features capture Scandinavian folklore and spiritual representation of Vikings as this movie does. Surely, the helmets have horns and most of them are barbaric, but the subtleties in the designs, motivations and overall outcome of the story is quite inspiring and unique. I never thought I needed a movie like this, a movie that while from the outside might seem as a generic vikings-vs-dragons movie holds so many themes and plot decisions that are surprisingly deep and emotionally moving. It doesn't cut back just for being a kid-targeted movie, it has double entendres and symbolisms that grants the movie many layers. The setting and character set-ups and presentations are incredibly well-realised, every one of them is unique and their motivations and character arcs are coherent and plausible. While sometimes over the top, the main Viking, the portrayal of their mentality and the treatment of dragons as \"pets\" may rob the movie of benefiting from a resfreshing historical accuracy; it makes up in character growth and a sense of friendship and comradery that when well portrayed it's endearing to watch. The only few issues, and I mean the only ones, in my opinion, are found in the voice acting of Hiccup. The actor actually did a good job in this movie, is just that the actor's voice I really don't like it as in other occasions it doesn't come accross as a cute dork but rather a satirical portrayal of a dork. Fortunately the actor does a decent job in this film thanks to the writing. And the other issue I personally find it on the exaggerated designs of some of the dragons. The movie stays pretty solid and ,while it has cartoonish character designs, the textures and imagery are pretty realistic; is just that the designs can be too jarring if they are overly-exaggerated (the translation from the 2D concept designs that appear on the end credits to 3D models in my opinion are not of my taste, but again I had always had a less preference for those cartoon-network-styled pointy designs so it's just a personal preference) It is one of those movies where you can figure the sort of premise it started out with (namely in the title) and realised how in the following brainstorm of ideas based on it molded the story it ended up with. As always, Dreamworks understands how to write and develop interesting and engaging characters, and this film is no exception. Added to the mesmerizingly jaw-drapping flight and action scenes, animal-like-captured dragon animation and traits; and an uplifting and adventurous soundtrack, and the film stands out for being unique in the genre and a welcome addition to the animation pantheon. IN CONCLUSION, a self-contained, solid and moving film about a Viking kid that tries to prove to not only the village but his own father that he is one of them yes, but also something more. Themes of acceptance, open-mindedness and courage next to enthralling action spectacle make for a child-friendly as well as adult-friendly entertaining experience. A must-watch for animation fans and everyone for that matter. Big plus is, the sequels, as always with Dreamworks, hold on to the essence of the first one and also expand it coherently.", "The boy is the first Viking who does not kill the dragon, but he is the only Viking who can ride the dragon. At the same time, he admires the perseverance of the male owner after breaking the leg. It is wonderful to dance with the dragon.The picture is amazing, the toothless and pleasing shape is very handsome, and the feeling of flying is too enjoyable. The story is wonderful and inspirational, and the father-son love, the feeling of small cockroaches and toothless are touching.", "With a somewhat unwieldy tile and the lack of the winning Pixar storyline that has dominated the Oscars for a decade, Dreamworks animations latest could have been a clunker. Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up. The latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the clich\u00e9) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined. The texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways. On the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching. Joining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means. Along with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon.", "The scene at the end of the movie really touched me. Hiccup struggles to get out of bed and heads for the door, supported by Toothless, which has never left the room. The director deliberately places Hiccup's legs and Toothless tail in the same shot. In just a few seconds, it tells the story of two individuals whose minds, lives or bodies are all broken, who meet each other and become a complete whole. Hiccup was originally an unacceptable loser. He was out of step with the group and could not get his father's approval. People regarded him as a problem. Toothless, as no one has ever seen it before, is a Toothless creature that comes and goes, destroying its opponents in an instant, but has never been known to man. When Toothless is bound and Hiccup's eyes are raised with a butcher's knife, a relationship of belonging, mutual trust, dependence, and ultimately strength begins. This is the kind of relationship that we wait for in real life but are always hard to find. Whether it is love or friendship, they are too vulnerable to too much desire and temptation in real life. With a theme like this, \"dragon\" doesn't need to be accompanied by the cruelty of reality like a pixar work. It just needs to create a dream that belongs to a child, but can make an adult feel happy and even moved at the same time, and then it will be successful.\nThere was no ice time in \"dragon\" at all, and the experience was like riding Disney's most exciting theme park roller coaster, SpaceMountain, for 90 minutes of absolute entertainment in 3D glasses. This time dreamworks boldly abandoned its own specialty of parody, the few small humor throughout the film just right, fully mobilize the atmosphere and lively narrative rhythm. Character design is even more endearing, especially as Toothless looks like a pet cat or dog, with every look and action so cute that viewers can't help but laugh or even put it down. The director, Dean DeBlois, was poached by dreamworks from Disney to direct the tepid Stitch in lilo & Stitch. Toothless has a lot in common with Stitch, not just its appearance and its teeth that contract, but its ferocious but honest insides. \"Dragon\" is another success in the film a lot of action, special effects the art and the progress of the 3 d technology, greatly increasing the appreciation of the film, the film driving dragon flight scene stimulation of romance, and 3 d technology compared to last year's \"ice age 3\" or \"up\" is definitely improved significantly. End is a topic of accurate convey, although it is a cliche communication and understanding, love and peace has not let a person feel tired, I feel very deep in the paragraph is when everyone knows the secrets of Hiccup is still determined to continue to play a game of unnecessary and war, Hiccup, as a small individual rolling between two camps, but powerless to stop to change anything.\nBut the dreamworks that is good at prankery is not the pixar that can tell a story all the time, although have big progress but because did not have the cover of prankery gimmick, flaw still exposed come out. The first is that the length of the film is limited due to the 3D and film types, and only 90 minutes is not enough to show such a completely empty legend. As a result, the film's opening is too hasty and the ending is handled too hastily. All the little conventions that are hard to swallow are concentrated at the end of the film, which is far from the previous part. It also influenced the production of supporting characters. Throughout the film, there were numerous types of flying dragons and various characters of Viking pirates, but ultimately there were no other characters I remembered and loved except Hiccup and Toothless. Back in the days of wall-e, there was MO, who didn't get many screen appearances but the audience couldn't get enough of him.\nThe dreamworks vs. pixar war has been going on for more than a decade, and the studio has been forced to make a case at the box office against an unbeatable competitor. Now that shrek's fourth installment has come to a dead end, and last year's monsters vs. aliens failed miserably, dreamworks desperately needs another kung fu panda to prove itself. \"How to train your dragon\" is a wonderfully humorous and engaging film, but it still takes real innovation to compete with its bigger rivals. Unfortunately, \"how to train your dragon\" looks like something new, but inside it is something old, as mentioned above, even the most eye-catching protagonist, Toothless, has already been made by a director, and this time it's just a repeat of itself. Aside from shrek: the fourth installment, which was already a desperate attempt to make money, dreamworks has only how to train your dragon to rival pixar's much-hyped toy story 3 this year.\n\"How to train your dragon\" is definitely recommended, at least for 90 minutes, it gave me a visual shock, a feeling of joy, and finally a little heart touch. For you and me, who are now under too much pressure, that's enough.", "The enemies in our hearts may not be hostile; what we admire is not necessarily truth. When we do not understand each other and only see the illusion of being enemies with each other, the misunderstanding will deepen in battle after battle. Only when we truly approached each other and understood the mottled truth inside and out, did we realize that the communication gap has been too deep and too deep. Thank God, when all was restored, someone discovered the truth.", "I saw this film first time in 8 or 9 years ago. After the first show, I was in love with that dragon. I saw this film more than 10 time and going to see it again in the next week. There is no doubt that it is one of the best film in animated movie history.", "I have seen the last one in film this year.It was pretty good to watch a dragon's growing and became a leader in the end.I love this movie.Fun and warmth are all in it.", "It satisfies you and me the ultimate fantasy of pets. The pet is a dragon, so dazzling!", "'How to Train Your Dragon' is based on the 2003 book series by Cressida Cowell. During pre-production, Deblois and Sanders took over writing the plot from Bonnie Arnold (producer) and decided to steer it away from working too closely to the book. They said they did not want to make it too childish and \"whimsical\". Instead they made slight changes, making the film appeal to a wider audience. A hapless young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed.  The story itself is very simple and predictable - being a film for children. But simplicity and predictability never tend to bother me; so long that, it is kept tight and runs smoothly - which 'How to Train Your Dragon' does, seamlessly. Having said this, the first few times I watched 'How to Train Your Dragon' - the film seemed off in structure and didn't really jump out at me for being the masterpiece it is today. However, the pacing and transitions work so well - the whole film gracefully jumps from one scene to the next. Theres a particular moment where the character Stoick, voiced by Gerard Butler (300), comes back from his travels and asks another character about his sons whereabouts. This then leads into a tremendous \"crash\" - an amazing sequence that I will later talk about. The whole film gives you enough time to understand each character and their development throughout. The main protagonist Hiccup, voiced by Jay Baruchel (This is the End), was one of the main focuses that drew me into the story. I felt that his character resembled much of my own - \"hapless\" but often finding his own way around oncoming obstacles. This is something that has been done, time and time again, and Hiccup is without a doubt, a cliche'. Nonetheless, his growth into the confident and \"strong\" viking; had me weeping as if I had accomplished something of great importance. The first time I actually watched 'How to Train Your Dragon' was in the summer of 2011; one year after it had been released. I remember catching it every time it was on 'Sky Movies' - and really remember properly watching it with my mum. It was just after I had passed my driving theory test, haplessly on my second attempt. This was a big moment for me and I really fell in love with the film. Mum and I would then go on to watching both; 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' and 'How to Train your Dragon: The Hidden World', in cinemas, on the week of their release. What we both realised, during this time, was how freakishly funny the relationship between Hiccup and his father Stoick, was very similar to the relationship I have with my step dad - a man who can endure lots of pain through hard times but is also incredibly stubborn and conservative. Whereas I am quite flexible and radical. This theme of conflicting personalities works so well as an obstacle whilst Hiccup strives, for a better future. This had me thinking about how films like 'How to Train Your Dragon', can really use its premise to inflict good morale, through its sweet and funny storyline. 'How to Train Your Dragon' has touched me on so many emotional levels. In fact, one evening (early hours), during my time at university, I was sobbing my eyes out - thinking \"wow\", this film is spectacular on so many levels. The first act of 'How to Train Your Dragon' starts off loud and fresh - introducing all the key characters through a well written monologue. We get a clear view of the setting, sense of humour and a taste for what is to come. Watching 'How to Train Your Dragon' now, actually seems like a blast from the past - I cannot believe it is ten years old. Because of this, the animation seems quite dated but is still, to this day, beautifully represented. The animation also has a particular style that I was not completely on board with. The film seemed clunky and not completely rendered, but because of the nature and atmosphere of the film, the animation suits it unbelievably well - you start to realise how detailed and aesthetically pleasing it all really is. What I found interesting about the making of 'How to Train Your Dragon' is that the cinematographer Roger Deakins (1917 and Blade Runner 2049) was a visual consultant for all three films - helping with the lighting and making the films look more 'live-action'. This can be seen through its epic action sequences and gorgeous backgrounds. The scene that begins with the tremendous \"crash\", that I previously talked about, is when Hiccup takes his new friend, Toothless the dragon, out for a 'Test Flight'. In this sequence, Hiccup is riding Toothless through the air as they test out Toothless' new tail, in order to help Toothless fly again. What is so amazing about this flight sequence is the music that \"crashes\" down, alerting the audience that the film is instantly getting more epic. The score that was written by John Powell (The Bourne Identity), has such a brilliant variety of themes which, I find myself humming whilst, remembering how perfectly composed and well integrated they all are. Another scene that captures this same brilliance is when Hiccup and Astrid, voiced by America Ferrera (Ugly Betty), are riding Toothless through the air to the theme of 'Romantic Flight'. The stunning visuals - flying through great big clouds amongst a beautiful sunset, and then diving into a blue, moonlit night - whilst this heartfelt tune builds up from an alluring Irish/Scottish violin, to a delightfully epic ochrestra; has me falling in love, with the film, every time I watch it. For the first time, Powell was nominated for the Oscar, but lost to Trent Reznor's (Gone Girl) and Atticus Ross' (Love & Mercy) brilliant score for 'The Social Network', directed by David Fincher. 'How to Train Your Dragon' was also nominated for 'Best Animated Feature Film' but lost to 'Toy Story 3', directed by Lee Unkrich. For most people and I, at the time, this was an easy win for the 'Toy Story' franchise. But looking back; 'How to Train Your Dragon' is so much more than just an animated film for children. There is a seriousness to it, that makes it just as important as the other films that were included in my top ten. Don't get me wrong; 'Toy Story 3' is an sensational film - an emotional rollercoaster that had me looking back at those wonderful childhood memories. But 'How to Train Your Dragon' still cuts deeper. \"Boasting dazzling animation, a script with surprising dramatic depth, and thrilling 3-D sequences, How to Train Your Dragon soars.\" - Rotten Tomatoes Theres a few moments in act three where the story takes new strides to grand moments of heroism and an action packed finale. Throughout the film there are so many great, dialogue driven scenes with Hiccup and his father, Stoick. As Hiccup develops into a more, confident and understanding person - Stoick's stubbornness is his main threat against everything he has achieved. Being both funny and frustrating, as Stoick tries to have 'normal' conversations with his son, about dragon slaying - Hiccup is never given the opportunity to speak his own mind or share his feelings. After Stoick finds out about Hiccups secret (being friends with a dragon), Stoick looses his temper in a heartbreaking scene, that feels brutally harsh and real. The moment when Stoick throws Hiccup aside and says; \"You've thrown your lot in with them. You're not a Viking... You're not my son.\" - genuinely has me in bits. What gets to me even more, is when Stoick walks out on the conversation and looks as if he is taken back by what he has just said. The expression on his face gives such a sense of 'actual' emotion, its hard to side with the fact that the film is still animated. This narrative is beautifully summarised - just before Hiccup takes on his biggest challenge - Hiccup and Toothless are saved by Stoick, who then says taking his hand: \"I'm proud to call you my son.\" Hiccup replies; \"Thanks, dad.\" and takes off. This is very warm moment that is delivered so perfectly as it shows two brilliant characters conclude their development. Theres a couple more points during the third act; one of them being when Hiccup and Toothless save Astrid from falling. Just after they set her off on her feet, she says \"Go\", which at first seems 'cheesy', but because of all the crucial events beforehand - it is very fitting and the cherry on the top just before, Hiccup and Toothless sore off to fight the big, evil dragon. However, I do not think this sentiment could be conveyed through a live-action film. Theres a lot that 'How to Train Your Dragon' gets away with (being an animated feature), but equally it does not shy away from taking risks, at being more than just a film for a young audience. The other point is - when all the fighting is done, when you think Hiccup has fallen to his fate; theres a moment of relief - but not the ending everyone was expecting. When Hiccup looses part of his left leg, theres a bitter-sweet tone - as he wakes up and discovers that he is actually disabled. The piece of music that is played in this small part - a version of the main theme played on piano, in a minor key - suits the feel of the scene so well; it conjures all these mixed emotions together, creating a fitting end for a beautiful and well developed friendship. Both, partially tailess Toothless and now partially legless Hiccup, need each other in order to function as one. I could go on forever about how beautifully woven this ending is, but it is time I conclude this review.", "Pretty amusing movie that despite it's clich\u00e9s is still entertaining. The plot is captivating and progressive, give incentive to defy elder's ideas and preconceptions such as that 'dragons are bad', which can be applied elsewhere.\nThe animation is cool, pretty creative in the dragon front, giving us cartoony versions of traits we consider dragon-like. I didn't like that it was so full of clich\u00e9s, even though it's expected form a kids movie, but the protagonist getting the girl with not flirting, by just by being different and quirky, is a misleading. But it was interesting to see the tables flipped - he guy is a sensitive, creative and thoughtful person, and the girl is\ntough, action-driven and 'impulsive'.", "How to train your dragon is one of my favorite movies of all time I love this movie so much if you want to talk the amazing friendship between hiccup and toothless which is amazing and soundtrack is also great and the voice cast is great for this movie and amazing special effects I love this and I highly recommend watching it", "Speechless ;) obviously referring to Toothless. Such a fragile charachter, he was chained to the ground but never has anyone flown so high. The story is told by a Hickup, a adolescent Viking boy. What's interresting is the fact that the way he's built corrolates with his personality.\nViolet, i think?, she's the oil on which the story rides. His love for her, inspires him to be his best version. VISUALS ARE EXCELLENT!\nFor all ages and all occasions. Greeting by CastEau", "There is only few good animated movies. This is one of them. It has a lot of originality(in my opinion) from animation, scenery, storyline and characters. Even if you happened to not like it at the end, there will definitely be sth in there that you will praise about this one", "Story carefully written, with an extremely good sound track, that gives you goosebumps every time you hear it, with an awesome combination of dialogs and a good characteristics construction of each character on the film. The relationship of the dragon with the boys makes you feel every evolution of it, together with them. A very good film to watch with all family.", "Firstly I want to start by saying this movie was my childhood and showed in theaters when I was 9 years old. I was always in love with Dragons such as Charizard and Blue-eyes-White Dragon when I was little so when I saw the poster I wanted to watch the movie straight away. Now let's start the review. The movie is about a boy named Hiccup who lives on the isle known as Berk. Not the strongest boy of all but surely is the smarters. Our fellow young hero of Viking is queer he thinks he will be more popular by killing a dragon which alternately leading him meeting the Dragon, the night fury known as Toothless. The animation is beautiful, the soundtrack my God the song \"Test Drive\" sends goosebumps down your skin while it's playing and that is what I remember when I saw the movie in the theatre the extremely beautiful soundtracks of this movie. This movie is amazing and is watchable for all ages.", "A cartoon that everyone should see. I liked that story. Teaches good and understanding. watched the whole family, we were delighted.", "One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I saw it as a kid and fell in love with it. Even today, I still regard it as one of my favorites. And now that the third movie is out, it's one of my favorite trilogies. The story here, I think, has been done before, but it's done so well that you don't care. The characters are also loveable. You can see yourself in Hiccup if you try. The animation is amazing. The music is spectacular. And it can be pretty funny. 9.3/10 (Amazing)", "I have seen bits and pieces of this movie as my Five-year-old daughter has claimed this (as well the other two how to train your dragon movies) as her favourite So it's been on a lot. (she equally loves how to train your Dragon two and three !) Tonight, watch the entire movie with her and I am hooked! Action packed, funny, heartwarming, great storyline, I LOVE this movie!! I Definitely recommend!", "I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE.

Enriched with emotions. Excellent work.", "Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is the clumsy, misunderstood son of the Viking chief, Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). He comes across an injured Night Fury, the most feared dragon of all, and finds that he can't kill it. He sets out to nurse it back to health and train it in secret, but then he is thrown into Dragon Training by his father while his father then sets off to find the Hidden Nest of the dragons and kill them all off. Suspicions mount about Hiccup and the Night Fury (whom Hiccup calls Toothless) might be so safe after all. Can Hiccup protect him and the rest of the dragons?\nI apologise for the bad plot description.\n(It's much better than how it sounds).\nThis is a great start to the trilogy. Butler and Baruchel do great jobs in their respective roles as father and son. Stoick is a very relatable single father who is trying to do a good job in raising his son.\nGreat character development and plenty of humour.\nThe CGI is good, but it definitely improves in the other films. Toothless is adorable and I like how they make the dragons have characteristics of pets such as cats, dogs, chickens, etc.\nThoroughly entertaining, though not one for everybody. Recommended.", "The graphics throughout this film are truly breath-taking, and the characters are engaging and entertaining. The plot is exciting and beautiful, and you just can't hate this film! Both children and adults will love it, so it's great as a family film.", "With excellent animations, a fantastic work of voices, an interesting script and an original story with a reflexive and emotional development for the audience, this is a film that children love pleasantly, however, is also an animated film that adults and young people can enjoy in a good way. Full of fun moments with intense entertainment, fantastic animation that complements some scenes that are quite cool and exciting that even excite the tension in an adult to see the fantastic combat between dragons. How to train your dragon is a great film that is made to entertain everyone and at the same time, cause an emotional movement in the one that admires it, giving a strong message and an excellent work of animated entertainment. Completely recommended for lovers of the genre.", "I am not an animation fan. But one of my friend recommend me to watch this movie. So i watched part 1 and i liked it and than i watch part 2 and finally i watched part 3 in cinemas and i liked all 3 part.", "A very good coming of age and companion movie, leaves you with a smile.", "It had been a few years since I'd seen this movie, even though I own both this film and the sequel (\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\"), and I was excited to revisit it. My revisit has rekindled my love for this movie. This is a wonderful film that fills me with joy each time I watch it.\nNot only is this a great kids movie, it appeals to adults; it's a great story with amazing design and more heart than I ever would've thought possible. While the story might be a touch predictable after it gets going, the character development that comes along with the story brings a level of earnestness to the story I rarely see in animated films. The people and their relationships feel real, as do the consequences for their actions. As tensions get higher near the end of the film, the world expands, and the consequences more dire.\nThe final battle in this movie is probably one of the best dragon fight scenes ever brought to cinema, if not the best (What other dragon films even compare to this one? \"Reign of Fire\"? Yeah, right...). The final fight, pitting the enormous dragon against Toothless and Hiccup is beautifully shot, absolutely stunning to watch, and epic in every sense of the word.", "I watched this movie with my family because my friends recommend it for me because I'm a big fan of dragons. MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED! The cliches are made well, and a great father son relationship. Toothless acts just like my cat. He is the cutest dragon ever! If you like dragons, I recommend this movie for you!", "This was a rewatch for me but it still hits all the best chords, even after 9 years. Great voice acting - Jay Baruchel's unique voice is perfect for Hiccup's unique character. Lots of great supporting voices. Well written characters and creatures. An unforgettable relationship in Hiccup and Toothless. The story is aimed at a young audience but enjoyable for all ages. The first of a great trilogy. Creative, unique and colourful. The music is perfect. Just all round perfect entertainment. I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Animated Family Adventure}", "Hiccup is a Viking ahead of his time. He is able to look at his own society much as an outsider would view it (Similar to \"Eric, the Viking\"). The village is besieged by dragons, but such is life for a Viking. Hiccup, as an intellectual Viking creates a weapon that is able to injure the infamous Night Fury Dragon, one that has never been seen by his people. Hiccup tracks the injured dragon on his own, however is unable to slaughter it when it lays defenseless trapped in ropes from his own weapon. Rather he cuts the dragon loose. They become friends as he brings it food. Hiccup splits his time caring from the dragon he names Toothless, and attending dragon school. He learns secrets by about dragons by caring for one. He applies what he has learned to dragon school, much to the amazement of his fellow students and instructors, becoming a child hero and legend. There is a young blond Viking lass he wants to impress. The plot is predictable and the movie is wonderful.", "Boasting dazzling animation, a script with surprising dramatic depth, and thrilling 3-D sequences, How to Train Your Dragon soars.", "I remember watching this almost 10 years ago. Absolutely breathtaking.\nIf Toothless doesn't get you, the soundtrack will. 'nuf said.", "Prior to How to Train Your Dragon, DreamWorks was known for making movies that had relatively cheap laughs, with a few exceptions. With How to Train Your Dragon, I consider this a departure from that characteristic. How to Train Your Dragon took a more mature approach toward the story they're working with. As a kid, I wasn't a huge fan of this movie when it came out, but when I watched it recently, it became one of my top 3 favorite animated movies, and that's saying something for me. DreamWorks also made one of the gutsiest moves they could've made. I say this because they made it look like an animated Avatar, with the extravagant landscapes, and fantastic 3D animation. I also have to add these little details. First off, the directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders made Lilo and Stitch, and were also involved with the writing process of Mulan. Talk about a big step forward for these two. Secondly, for those of you who know cinematographers, the two hired the one and only Roger Deakins as a visual consultant for this film. With his repertoire of films, Deakins managed to get the vision that DeBlois and Sanders wanted to come alive on the big screen. What else can this movie offer? A whole lot more, but I won't say anything more without sounding like an idiot.", "Do I even need to say that I enjoyed this movie? The visual effects were breathtaking, especially the hidden world, and the light-fury. It was a moving story, with empowering love. This movie was probably a delight for children, and probably surprised adults as well. I heard a man in the theatre proclaim that it was trash and didn't deserve his money. Well, many people told him that it was worth it, and even his wife gladly replied that it was one of the best animated films she'd ever seen before. Needless to say, How To Train Your Dragon, not surprisingly, has earned many good reviews. Thank you for taking your time to scan this review. If you haven't, watch this movie.", "I absolutely love the How to Train Your Dragon series. My favorite animated story ever created really made me realize how animation has grown up as I have grown up. My generation relates to most animated stories more so than any other generation and for this i'm grateful for this movie!", "The movie that started it all\nA real masterpiece by Dreamworks that can keep any audience entertained.\nThe visuals are just amazing, specially for a 2010 film and it holds up to this day and the story is not boring or immature in any way, both kids and adults will find it entertaining Buy it if you can, a must have movie that you can watch multiple times, with each time you will find something new in it!", "How to Train Your Dragon (4.5 out of 5 stars). How to Train Your Dragon is a cute, fun, and exciting animated action fantasy film that adults and children will enjoy. The animation is beautifully done. With the story taking place in the Viking era. In a fantasy world, were a Viking village is always on defense against dragons. And an awkward growing up teen Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) feels like an outcast training to hunt dragons. Disappointed in his fathers Stoick (Gerard Butler) eyes. Hiccup comes across a night fury dragon named Toothless with an injured wing. He helps the dragon and learns the techniques to befriend with it. Hiccup soon learns the truth that the dragons are not really the real threat that opposes towards the people. It has a cute inspiring plot. Hiccup is that one character that feels like an outsider to his village. Every one is a brute and tough. And he is that type of character that just does not fit in. When he learns the ways to become friends with a dragon. Even making the dragons feel like a dog with the spots to rub and calm the dragon down. It was a lot of fun seeing Hiccup and other kids training to fight against dragons. It becomes a competition with Astrid (America Ferrera), which Hiccup has a crush on. The animation is fantastic. It is colorful, and visually exciting. The sequences with Hiccup flying with Toothless was breathtaking. It matches up to the sequence with Jake flying one of those dinosaur looking birds from the movie Avatar. When the Viking villagers and Hiccup comes across a big monstrous bad dragon that is loose in the climax and wrecking havoc. It was a fantastic climatic battle with Hiccup and Toothless against the bad dragon. Overall, How to Train Your Dragon is a really good family fantasy film which kids and adults will enjoy. It has plenty of action, the plot is cute and inspiring, and the animation is beyond fantastic.", "I am never tired of watching this film again, their story, their character, always surprises me. this film gives a tremendous surprise beyond expectations, and an amazing action action in every scene", "It was a good film but I though it lost its way part way through; at the start Hiccup shoots down Toothless and breaks part of his tail, over time he developed a tail fin controlled by a foot pedal that enabled him to fly.\nI loved the scenes of Hiccup and Toothless learning to work together to fly and perfecting the fin and pedal mechanism, then when Hiccup lost his cheat sheet he instinctively was able to control the fin and the two flew together perfectly. Then they get discovered by Astrid, but before she can get back to the village to expose them, Hiccup and Toothless catch her and strand her in a tall tree to talk. Here the film looses the plot, rather than returning Astrid to the ground, Toothless rockets into the sky with a series of loops and rolls.\nSuch activities earlier in the film were impossible without Hiccup to control the tail fin, Toothless couldn't even take off on his own! And it is very unlikely that Hiccup helped with his flying as he told Toothless to return to the ground gently. Throughout the film Toothless became able to fly more and more without Hiccups input; flying to the dragon island and into thier nest, then later he flew into the village to save Hiccup in the arena cage.", "First off let me say am a huge fan of the how to train your dragon series and the first and the secend how to train your dragon movies i would rate 9 out of 10 not because i love the film franchise but because the first film was okay but not as good as how to train your dragon 2 and how to train your dragon the hidden world", "This movie is way too cute and it never gets boring. The animation is fluent and detailed and therefore just how it supposed to be!", "Life there is amazing! How to Train Your Dragon is always my favorite movie!", "This story may sound a bit cliche on the surface, a young weak boy who can't live up to his father, a parent who doesn't understand, keeping a pet hidden until it's discoveres, but once you start watching you find yourself deeply invested in these characters and you don't want to miss a thing they do. The story revolves around Hiccup a young Viking boy who is the son of the chief of a Viking tribe that hunts and kills dragons because they constantly attack and raid the village and so they are at war. When hiccup, luck might have it, successfully shoots down a dragon and begins to befriend the beast. This is where the story becomes excellent, to bond between Hiccup and his new dragon friend Toothless. Hiccup learns to train toothless and builds a contraption that can help him fly. When discovering they both need each other to survive, they become inseparable, and it is up to the two of them to show the rest of the Vikings that dragons can be understood and, with a bit of patience, can be trained like dogs.\nThis is a movie that respects children and wants them to be invested in the characters for the whole film without getting bored. This film is incredibly successful in doing so by being funny, compelling, and most of all mature. Along with stunning visuals and one of the best musical scores in film history, it was even nominated for Best Original Score at the Oscars, this film delivers on everything you would want to see in a great film. Weather child or adult, this movie will appeal to anyone.", "I've been putting this off for years, and for the life of me I have no idea why. Dreamworks are often hit and miss for me, but this beautifully touching animation has enough heart to appeal to every family member and is definitely a hit. Hiccup is not like the rest of his Viking villagers, he refuses to kill dragons. He soon befriends the legendary \"Night Fury\", who he names Toothless, where he learns that dragons are not so ferocious after all. Packed with memorable characters, humorous dialogue and exhilarating flight sequences, it has everything one would expect from a family adventure. Plenty of development from the protagonist who sees his frightened self within Toothless. A prickly relationship with his father makes for some tension and relatable conflict, forcing Hiccup to be something he is not. Wonderfully paced with a surprising amount of laughs, particularly from the well casted voice actors (Butler especially!). Baruchel juxtaposes the primarily Scottish cast, and highlights his character's difference with the rest of the village. However, it is the tangible relationship between Hiccup and Toothless that makes this film work. Hiccup finds purpose with his newly tamed dragon, and there are so many moving scenes involving them that you can't help but become attached to them. An extensive five minute scene where the two learn to be in each other's company gave me goosebumps. No dialogue, just powerfully stunning visual storytelling that silenced me. The animation itself is often majestic, particularly with its environments and fast-paced action. Although some of the lighting was too dark, making certain scenes rather murky, but for the most part was watchable. I did have some issues with Astrid as a character though. An underdeveloped romance blooms between her and Hiccup and some of her dialogue was rushed and undercooked, particularly when motivating Hiccup to save Toothless. Small criticisms for what is an excellent animation that packs an almighty amount of fire and soars higher than Toothless himself.", "Amazing animation (Even Today)\nvery human characters\ngreat story\na decent conflict\nAnd much more, if you haven't see it yet go watch it!", "I think this movie is terrific...nuff said. I love how Hiccup uses observation, logic, and reasoning over violence towards the dragons. Plus, the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is adorable.", "First of all, the animation in this is spectacular. All the scenery in the film looks like something you could find in real life. The action, mainly the climax, and flying shots in this film also show how great the animation is. The main thing about the animation that is amazing is how the dragons look. They all look like real, kinda cartoonish, dragons that come across as vicious but also cute. The cinematography in this film is stunning. The lighting in each and every scene was chosen correctly for it. I really like the score in this film that was done by John Powell. The music in the film just helped bring you into this fantasy world of Vikings and dragons. Now my main problem is mainly the casting of the voice actors. They all did great jobs as their roles but I think some of them would have been better casted if their character was older and not a teenager. That can mainly be seen with Hiccup who is supposed to be a teenager but sounds like an adult who already went through puberty. I also had a few issues with the pacing in this film. Some scenes were way too short and I would have liked to have seen them a tiny bit longer. Now I do get that it's a film made for children but as long as there's moving objects on screen kids won't care what's happening in the movie. In the end How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent film for everybody no matter how old you are.", "Thomas And Twilight Sparkle's Adventures Series Viking Engine Ponies and Yak", "This movie is just amazing, in the best sense of the word. Especially because the film has so many things that I can not stand and had to endure more than 1000 times in children's films. I'm blown away as always.\nEvery time something new happens you will see how both characters and the environment react to it, (almost) all the characters and characters are slightly stereotypical kids adventure characters but totally designed in contrast to their visual appearance and the flight sequences are just the stuff to be made of dreams.\nThat's why there is 3D cinema you have the impression you are a part of this world and of the experience. The animation itself can not compete with \"Pixar's\", but the world excels. I'm honestly aware of this movie only through the TV series and I'm sorry that I did not get to see it on the IMAX, but I'm always waiting for a new release.\nThe characters are made unique, the story is well known but narrated in a new, unique way, and the flight tendons are some of the best ever shown.\nI do not really like the voice of \"Hiccup\" but everything else about this movie and what it says is so awesome that I can hear about it, I'm glad that I saw this movie and I have no idea how you feel about it have already seen and still will. \"Astrid\" is so much better that I think she is my favorite character followed by \"Hiccup\" with 99%.\nThe symbiosis and symbolism between humans and dragons is beautiful and it makes me happy every now and then to feel the danger in a movie to have me so worried about the characters. Besides, how often do we have movie characters with a disability? certainly not main characters in a children franchise How to train your Dragon is creative, funny, warming heart, fun and never boring.\nIt is a pizza that was almost only occupied with things I do not like but properly laid out and properly dosed and suitable spice so that it tastes even better than many pizzas that were only filled with things I like\nI just have to see the title and immediately when I'm happy. I want a dragon too.", "The animation is just gorgeous(it looks even better in the second movie). While the movie is far from flawless you can tell how much pain staking hard work was put into this movie. The music alone makes the movie feel titanic in its tone. All the Dragon designs are creative and cool, the side characters are a little weak but in the end they aren't annoying. We have seen a protagonist like Hiccup a few times before but he doesn't feel shoehorned into the movie.", "Dreamworks has done it again with a well made film for the whole family to enjoy. A great cast as the voices with Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. \nA well written story about a young boy who is to be a Viking Daragonslayer as he grows into it. He is much smaller and frail than the rest of the kids but he has drive and ambition. What he finds is that the dragons are not as mean and ugly as they are represented. It is a creatively drawn format on how a boy befriends and trains a dragon. I thought the film flowed perfectly and was well made in animation and cinematography. I strongly suggest watching this film, it is a feel good action and comedy animated success 8 out of 10", "Overall this film is fun and refreshing animated adventure that can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike. While this movie is moving and entertaining, it isn't perfect.  Negatives\n Positives\n Overall, this movie isn't perfect. But it's one of the few non-Disney animated movies that takes you on an emotional journey. The characters- especially Toothless, Hiccup, and Astrid- are lovable and gain the sympathy of the audience with their exellent development. The climax is action packed but relied heavily on the characters' relationships with each other, and the emotional moment at the end was heart wrenching. All-in-all this film is fun and entertaining while also being refreshingly emotional, with a great story, exciting action, and lovable characters.", "MY BEST ANIMATED MOVIE since ever LOOL .............", "A true masterpiece from dreamworks. This is a movie that will be loved by many generations to come. The visuals are stunning and the storyline is an outstanding achievement. I'll only write a review if I enjoy a movie and this is no exception.\nA village of vikings is continuously raided by dragons for their food and the towns runt (Hiccup) who isn't allowed to help fight them off (because of his size) is determined to win his fame by killing the most feared (and never seen) dragon of them all. The night fury. After he uses a self made device Hiccup has his opportunity kill it and win the hearts of his village and the girl of his dreams (Astrid) but sees something deeper than the mindless monsters that he has been bought up to believe them to be.\nAfter winning the night furys trust, a friendship blossoms but Hiccup needs to somehow convince his village and his father (Stoick the vast) that these creatures are stealing from them for a much, much more menacing reason.\nMy family and i love this movie. It has all the ingredients to make the perfect piece of entertainment for a great film. I especially love the touching scene where Hiccup actually manages to win Astrid's heart. An unforgettable moment with amazing visuals and music. If you haven't seen this with your family. You are depriving them of an unforgettable experience.", "Amazing movie.......\nI can't describe how much i love this movie......really this movie is awesome.\nbest animation movie ever...", "Love the first film let's hope after the 3rd film they end the whole series with one last Tv show", "Oh, this was just fantastic! Great premise. Great animation. Great voicing. Great music. This was just such a sweet little film. 'Never judge a book by its cover' has probably never been better depicted - in this case from the young Viking Hiccup's perspective, as well as from the dragons. It is a story about an unlikely friendship, and how if affects everyone and everything around them. I loved the characters and the story. What an absolutely beautiful film. This is the type of animation film that will appeal to young and old.", "An animated adventure with Vikings and Dragons? And it's funny too? I'm sold! Actually it's also very well animated and features some darker elements about life too, very refreshing for an animation mostly aimed at kids.", "...not that this is necessarily saying much, since the films of the past decade are either made for the Academy Awards with some social message that hits the audience over the head with a social justice sledgehammer, or they are action films with lots of car chases and explosions and comic book heroes or they are 50 shades of obscene. But I digress.  This animated film is beautiful to watch, but that is not the main drawing point. The drawing point are the characters. Even though this is set in some fictitious land full of Vikings beset with fire breathing dragons who are always raiding their livestock, you can easily relate to everybody. The main character, Hiccup, is the son of the warrior king of the Vikings. Hiccup is mild mannered, lanky, awkward - your typical teen of about age 14. He likes to build and invent things. Dad wants his son to be a dragon slayer. So one day, during an attack by the dragons, Hiccup actually catches one with one of his inventions. He grabs a knife and runs into the forest to kill the dragon to make dad happy. But he just can't. This \"fearsome\" dragon is tame, passive, dog-like before people had dogs. And so \"Toothless\" as Hiccup names him, becomes like a pet to Hiccup. The pair develop this beautiful unbreakable bond. And Hiccup learns about dragons. Hiccup is signed up for Dragon Killing class with the rest of the island's teens. Hiccup quickly rises to the top of his class but manages to not kill even one dragon. Instead he uses the techniques of bonding with dragons that he has learned from Toothless to subdue them into harmless pets. Nobody questions what is going on but Astrid, a tomboyish teen girl who just knows Hiccup is up to something. This film has genuine laughs, thrills, the real problems of sons and fathers disappointing and misunderstanding one another, the awkwardness of that first romance, and the idea that sometimes your enemy may be your enemy for reasons you don't understand.  I watched this for about the tenth time last night and I have to say it just never gets old. Highly recommended.", "Warning: this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive! As soon as it's over you'll immediately want to watch it again. So much fun, never cheesy and for pure entertainment value quite simply the best animated film since 1967's 'The Jungle Book' (well, at least in my humble opinion). No surprise, given that co-director Chris Sanders has had a hand in every good Disney film starting with Aladdin until he left the mouse house in 2006 (and I suspect John Lasseter now regrets letting him go). And as much as I adore and admire pretty much every Pixar film, for this once, Dreamworks just had the movie with the higher 're-watchability factor' which makes it one of my favourites. See it!", "How to Train Your Dragon is a breathtakingly animated movie which deserves high praise for that, but even though it has a couple of really good elements it also has noticable drawbacks. I'll explain One of the best aspects of HTTYD is the animation. The flight scenes and the discovery of the dragons are highlights of the movie, because the creativity put into making every dragon unique is wonderful, and when you see those landscapes from above your jaw will drop. Just amazing work of animation. Another great thing is this very real and organic build-up of the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, because it's not an easy task, and that leads to the later conflict which is clich\u00e9d but is well excecuted No wonder Chris Sanders had a directoral role in this moving story, after all he was the writer of Disney's Lilo & Stitch which also had touchingly dramatic scenes. Toothless reminded me of Stitch, and it isn't hard to guess why the writer of that that movie could make a character with similar mannerisms. But many of these characters are pretty weak in their characterizations, because they either come off as one-note, mean-spirited or both. Hiccup's co-students in his training to become a viking warrior are easily described with simple tropes with almost no depth to them. Well, Astrid has some dimensions to her, because she discovers Hiccup's secret as the story progresses, but the others are kind of annoying one-trope characters. And Hiccup's father kept on being so mean to him that I found him pretty hateable, because even when his son has proven his worth he still makes less blatant mean comments. That aspect of the movie just got on my nerves. The sequel is better in my opinion, because its focus is more on the world around them rather than on the characters and bigger consequences happened and added a less predictable feel to its story, but HTTYD started it all so therefore I can't deny it's worth. So all in all: Breathtaking animation and a well excecuted start of a beautiful friendship between two characters are highlights in an otherwise predictable story with many weak characters.", "I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter so I've been catching up on my children/family movies of the past two decades and How to Train Your Dragon is one of my favorite animation movies I've seen. We nearly skipped this movie after watching the trailer, something about it just didn't peak my interests right off the bat but my wife had heard great things about it so we ordered it anyway and was blown away! My wife and I enjoyed enjoyed this movie just as much as my daughter did with its well placed comedy and well thought out story line.", "I love this movie! I would love to read the books some day and would love to see more sequels.", "Animated features are usually very colorful and offer a whole lot of fun, but I don't understand how they manage to score so high against your more prevalent live action movies. I think it has to do with viewers rating each one on a personal standard against other animated films, with the result having pictures like this winding up with a rating above 8.0. So as I write this, the film ranks higher in the IMDb Top #250 than \"Platoon\", \"Hotel Rwanda\" and 1959's \"Ben Hur\". Anyone see the irony in that? I don't know that there's a way to fix that other than to separate animated movies into their own category, but I don't know if that would be fair either. Anyway, that's my little side spiel. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is in fact a highly entertaining flick for all members of the family, with lots of dazzling action and likable characters. I particularly liked the names the writers came up with for the various types of dragons, like Nadder Heads, Gronckles, Two-Headed Zipplebacks and Monstrous Nightmares. It turns out our feature creature is a rare and never before seen Night Fury, the ultimate in dragon lore as it were. I was kind of expecting more along the lines of a green scaled monster myself, but good old Toothless had a nice appeal once you got to know him. I thought the name 'Toothy' might have been a better one for Hiccup to come up with, but the irony worked well enough. When it came time to battle the formidable monster dragon from deep in the mountain nest, the thing looked more like a dinosaur and it looked like the Vikings might have finally met their doom. But that would never happen in a Dreamworks film, if it had there wouldn't have been a couple of sequels already. The battle scenes are some of the finest animation you're likely to ever come across, and of course, all's well that ends well with Hiccup, Astrid, Stoick the Vast and all the other colorful Viking characters.", "There is saying in India 'do jism or ek jaan' meaning 'Two bodies one soul'. This statement suit the relationship between hiccup and toothless. This was the relationship which I cherished from the movie, the most. It is worth watching for adults as well as children. Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It is excellent. Tone: The tone relies on story where it is learnt that dragons are not dangerous and instead of killing them, they can be raised as pets. It is constructed well. Music: Music is average. It is worth watching multiple times.", "I remember seeing this film ages ago, but since I hadn't posted my thoughts on it up on IMDb (and also that I prefer to write down my thoughts after having recently seen the film), I decided to sit down and watch it again. Well, there was also the fact that the sequel had recently been on television, and I wanted a bit of a refresher before delving into that one, and anyway, it was also a pretty good movie, at least from what I can remember. Well, now that I have watched it a second time much more recently, I can certainly attest to it being a pretty cool movie. The film is set in a viking village that happens to have a dragon problem. As such all of the inhabitants are geared towards killing dragons, all except Hiccup, who happens to be rather scrawny. However, despite his stature, he is a bit of an inventor, and he invents a device designed to bring down a dragon, which he does. However, when he finds the dragon instead of killing it, he frees it, and slowly discovers that dragons are nowhere near as bad as everybody else thought. As I mentioned, this is a pretty cool movie. It's a kids movie which generally means nobody is going to die (with the exception of the bad guy), and despite the antagonists being dragons, they refrain from killing any of the dragons either. Then again, the movie is trying to build our sympathy towards the dragons, so it probably helps with that by having the no killing rule on them as well. So, the film is about misunderstandings, and how misunderstandings can lead to generations of warfare. This is the case with dragons because while they seem to be dangerous, in reality, when you get to know them, and also show them friendship, then they will actually respond in kind. However, while Hiccup knows the truth, actually convincing others of it is a different story. The other thing is that the young in the village have to go to dragon fighting school, and in using what he has learnt from Toothless, he is able to excel, that is until they ask him to actually kill a dragon. Okay, I have mentioned it a few times now, but saying it again won't hurt, and that is that this is a pretty cool, and entertaining, film. Now I have to go off an watch the sequel.", "How to Train Your Dragon is a triumphant piece of storytelling. It has humour, it has emotional depth, it has engaging drama, and its action set pieces carry genuine weight, without the film having to rely on them for thrills. The star of the show is Toothless - I've watched this film a number of times, and he never fails to make me laugh, and to make me care. He is animated superbly, his movements and expressions giving him immense charm and personality without resorting to the caricatured anthropomorphism Dreamworks so often deals in. Indeed, the film as a whole strikes a perfect balance between cartoon character design and aesthetics - there are some breathtakingly beautiful scenes, especially in the landscape shots. There is very little to find fault with in this film, except the children, who seem to have been lifted from a cheap American high school movie and dropped into a Viking setting, accents and all. That's not to say that the characters aren't engaging - Hiccup himself has huge personality as the protagonist, and the rest of the gang act as effective foils - it's just that they occasionally detract somewhat from the atmosphere. Then again, one could say the same thing about the rest of the Vikings sounding Scottish - fortunately, this isn't the sort of film that needs to rely on accuracy! Ultimately, such little niggles don't detract from what is a superb piece of work. I will keep returning to this film again and again, because it is just such tremendous fun.", "The story is a bit weak as it is a combination of two clich\u00e9 stories, however, the execution of it can make it enjoyable, so despite being a clich\u00e9 story, it is not a boring one. The animation is the strongest aspect of the movie, from the backgrounds, to the character design, everything is beautiful. The flight scenes are really engaging and are almost indescribable because of how beautiful they are. However the two things that make me itch a bit the animation are the textures and the dragon's design. The textures are nice, but the human skin needs a bit more polish. The designs of the dragons are good, but they feel a bit out of place in this mostly realistic movie (Toothless does not count because it's design was inspired by Stitch). The characters are arguably the weakest point of the movie. Hiccup is a likable character, but some people might find that the movie is forcing the audience to like him. Stoick is in my opinion the most likable character. The relationship between Astrid and Hiccup also feels a bit forced but it can have its food moments. The rest are mostly comic reliefs that despite feeling a bit clich\u00e9, can have their good moments. Like the story, the characters might be clich\u00e9, but their execution makes them likable. I recommend this to people who give more importance to visuals rather than story or characters.", "This film is spectacular! The music is well composed, the characters well defined, and the plot a good one! a surprisingly amazing film for DreamWorks. I hope to see this made into a live action someday. Well written, great feel to it. This will not disappoint! Summary: A wonderful watch for all ages!", "The island of Berk is a remote Viking village, from which dragons periodically steal livestock. Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is too small to fight the dragons and instead fashions mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber the blacksmith, though his inventions often backfire. During one attack, Hiccup believes he has shot down a Night Fury, an extremely rare and dangerous dragon. Hiccup later finds it in the forest trapped in his bolas, but finds that he can't bring himself to kill the dragon and instead sets it free. Stoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons' nest, leaving Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class taught by Gobber. Hiccup returns to the forest to find the Night Fury still there, and realizes it is unable to fly properly because of its crippled caudal fin. Hiccup gradually tames the dragon and gives it the name \"Toothless\", for its retractable teeth. Hiccup makes a harness and prosthetic fin that allows him to guide the dragon in free flight. By studying Toothless' behavior, Hiccup becomes proficient in subduing the captive dragons during training. Stoick's fleet arrives home unsuccessful, but he is cheered by Hiccup's unexpected success.", "How to Train Your Dragon Reveals Modern Familial Relationships Written for IMDb.com How to Train Your Dragon is a film which reveals the lack of familial relationships in current society through Hiccup's struggle to impress his father, Stoick, and the rest of his village. In this film, Hiccup is a young viking who lives on the island of Berk, beset every night by dragon attacks. Hiccup is small and weak for his age, and is ostracized by the rest of the village. This film follows Hiccup's search for family and friends in a society he does not seem to fit into. Jay Baruchel does a good job of displaying Hiccup as a young boy trying to impress his father, because of how weak he is. Gerard Butler reveals Stoick's character as a busy chieftain who usually has no time for his incompetent son. This reveals the struggles of fathers and sons in real life, with the father usually being too busy to help his son and the son finding that the only way to get his father's attention is to get in trouble. Hiccup ends up, as many children today do, finding a sense of belonging outside of his family, with his dragon Toothless. By the time Stoick starts paying attention to Hiccup, Hiccup has already found his place with a friend who he can always count on, but grows distant from his real family in the process. Children nowadays face similar problems, always searching for a sense of belonging. Their family is often too busy with work and the virtual world, and so the children grow distant from their family and instead come to rely on a group of friends who are very different from their parents. Although the actual volume of sappy emotions in the film is very low, the lack of volume in that area is made up for. The reduction of emotion is compensated by the large amounts of explosive, aerial dragon combat. This film is very similar to a video game in its action and realistic quality. Overall, the directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, wrote an engaging and exciting movie that is an accurate depiction of the relationship between children and parents today.", "One of the most joyous animated films i have ever seen with a goose bump inducing soundtrack from John Powell that elevates the film to classic status. With a hopeful message of getting to know and understand your enemy to discover they may not be as monstrous as you suspect this is a wonderful story. Upon first viewing this i was reluctant to watch due to Dragon movies generally being poor and this being a \"kids\" film, I was also put off by the unusual design of the Dragon's which looked silly to my eye but the story got me hooked especially when Hiccup voiced wonderfully by Jay Baruchel finds the wounded Toothless. These scenes of initial fear that gradually turn to mutual trust and bonding are wonderful and the heart of the film. I was worried the plot was going to have Astrid America Ferrera report Hiccup to his father Stoick Gerard Butler but instead Astrid joins Hiccup in his adventure and the film is all the better for it. We never get bogged down in forced romances. The real romance is a bromance between Hiccup and Toothless. The soaring flying scenes with John Powell's driving score raise hairs on back of neck particularly in the training flight and more beautifully in the romantic flight with Astrid. Every film needs a villain and this is perhaps HTTYD's weakest point. The final battle is visually spectacular as Hiccup proves himself to his father and takes on a giant Dragon losing a limb in the process but i think it felt just a little rushed and needed further set up but this is just nitpicking.", "impressive at each level. one of animations who reminds the original seduction of genre and the taste of adventure. simple and beautiful and realistic. inspired pledge for discover the seduction of mixed history with fairy tale and new perspective about dragons. lovely characters. and wise script who defines rules and rhythm of story in the most smart manner. it is the emotion who rules in its case. because it seems be perfect. a credible story, beautiful characters, good turns of action, the virtues in the nice manner presented. and a hero profound different by the other from the animations of the last decade. so, an admirable work.", "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" It is one of the best animated films I've seen , from the beginning to the end is a very well developed film, With an excellent cast and excellent direction of the directors \" Dean DeBlois , Chris Sanders .\" You can not leave that there was an excellent chemistry between the boy and the dragon . you enter the world of dragons and humans who feel you are living in that movie that great experience .

How To Train Your Dragon finally brought the studio back into the spotlight and returned them back to form, with their greatest hit in years and to the opinions of some as their greatest film ever (this is disputed with Shrek 2.) How To Train Your Dragon, is set during an fictional Viking setting, in a land plagued by dragons and the Viking's desire to finally wipe them out once and for all. Here we are introduced to Hiccup, a shy, awkward and weak son of a great viking warrior, struggling to find his place in this world with men fighting for survival. After an attack on the village, Hiccup injures a dragon and begins to track it only to find himself bonding and connecting with the dragon on an emotional level, completely outside the realms and depths any Viking had gone before. How To Train Your Dragon is beautifully animated, with the animation being smooth and crisp and having a unique style for itself. The characters are likable, relatable and their motivations and actions clear (while some may seem a little stereotypical.) The emotional scenes between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon are charming and sweet and the two serve as the story's unlikely companionship, especially the flying sequences which may be some of the greatest looking and heartfelt moments in an animation film ever. The film flows well with the distinct first, second and third act and never looses steam, neither containing unnecessary scenes or wasted screen time. Despite a few exposition and an unfortunate flaw in the accents of the characters, the film is close to perfect- while it may be nit-picking, the mix of Scottish and American accents just don't seem to fit the setting very well and can come off as a bit annoying. As a summary, How To Train Your Dragon is gorgeously animated, charming and sweet to the core and has a very well developed plot as well as being a great return to form for DreamWorks Animation. 8/10", "How to Train Your Dragon is a very fun and funny animation , a great start to a trilogy of Dreamworks , or even a saga , the voice work is great, the actors combines very well with their characters , the characters are charismatic and funny , the soundtrack is great , is funny and exciting moments , maybe some viewers fell in tears , the animation takes action , and fortunately are good, the pace of the film is nice , the plot does not get to be as original , even more so the film is not packed things already seen in other animated, you do not see the time passing , How to Train your Dragon is one of the best animation from Dreamworks (if not for the better) has great moments , and it's very funny . note 8.5", "This has been my favorite movie of all time. I have watched it about 20 times. The first movie of How To Train Your Dragon I watched was the 2nd one. I didn't know their was a 1st one until somebody said . I got into How To Train Your Dragon through watching the TV episodes I think I have watched them all. Like the episode it is about the chief Stoiks son Hiccup. The movie tells the story of how hiccups meets Toothless the night furry. Everybody in the village thinks that dragons are dangerous creatures, when they need to bring food to the dragons king or get eaten themselves. When Hiccup wants to help kill dragons his father, Stoick wont let him, but when he shoots a night furry down he cant kill it. So he trains it.", "It is truly an amazing movie which I was quite reluctant to get hold of it when it was shown in the theater. I then decided to watch this and to my surprise, it was really beautiful. What I meant was, the story line that truly touches heart between human and animal created the bonding and trust with many form of interactions. That really given me to wanted to own a dragon myself in real life if possible. The flying technique, the get together, train up the little beast, they even have some comedy added on, the true-self for being who you really are, to provide warm to your friend even though toothless is your pet and many more adventures to explore. I am touched and never regret getting that ticket to watch this fascinating movie. I then watched it many times later. Go for it and it is worth watching it. Don't forget to watch Part 2 too.", "How To Train Your Dragon is an excellently done movie. The story is well paced with very likable characters. The characters were all developed very well for a family movie with many of them saying some memorable lines. There is also a good amount of humour which makes this a very enjoyable film that one would see many times. The animation looks amazing and the soundtrack is fantastic. I give it a 9/10. I have already seen this movie several times, and will continue to re-watch the movie in the years to come. If you like this short and quick review, please check out my other reviews for other movies.", "Original Score: 3.5/4, Movie: **** (4/5), Quality: **** (4/5) Creating a film with such an inventive (and cool) concept that will be both enjoyable and meaningful to watch, that will enthrall kids from all around the world with its breathtaking scenery, soaring music and above all: It's story. I'll state that the greatness of the film is its story telling. You may notice the visual and verbal storytelling. Both from Hiccup narrating and on screen animation which includes what the characters do and say, and also the visual style. The film much like visual effects, tells us its story with its animation and visuals. An example is when Hiccup is reading through The Dragon Manual, in which the film introduces you to the dragons of the film. Meanwhile, there's the story. This is the story about a Viking teenager and a fierce dragon. When the teenager captured the dragon, he was supposed to kill it. But instead he chose to let him go. Here is a moment of compassion that evokes the same feelings as The Good Dinosaur (2015) and Casablanca (1942), both of which have themes of compassion within their stories as well. Here is another film about the same theme, in which the two became good friends just like how Arlo and Spot became good friends and help each other out in The Good Dinosaur (2015). In the meantime, I wish that people would stop looking down upon a film like The Good Dinosaur (2015) and look for what the film is trying to tell them instead. Just as I hope that how critics would chose to view this film. Hey, here is a good film for kids to enjoy and learn from. At the same time they will be entertained with what the film is about: \"How to train your dragon\". So how do you train your dragon? Well there's no dragon in the real world here. But boy is the concept as inventive as it is entertaining. Impressing many of its audiences as well as entertaining them. It's got a world of its own, just like Star Wars (1977). However, impressing the audiences wasn't the key point of the film; it is the story of the film that is the important highlight of the film. A story that has its themes embedded within and for the audiences to find. It shows how powerful friendship is, and what they can do. Much like Jack London's Novel White Fang, which shows the relationship between Man and Wolves. (Spoiler Ahead) In the novel, in which Scott tames White Fang using love and compassion, is the same as how Hiccup tamed a mighty beast like Toothless the Night Fury. (Spoiler End). Their friendship changed the relationship between the two of them. In fact, not only between the two of them, but also between two species, that is Dragons and Humans (Vikings). Can it be any clearer? The themes of the film? Turns out all we needed is a little more of\u0085.. this. And by this I mean a better way to solve a problem. To which the problem is the pests of Berk, in which later becomes the pets of Berk instead. There's an anti-war message here.  The musical score is as dramatic as it is brilliant. Know it that the Musical score enhanced the viewing experience for the viewers of the film. But should we judge a film based upon the experience of our viewing? Yep, but not how much we enjoyed it in my opinion. I didn't enjoy myself upon my viewing of the film, though I find the writing very good. The storytelling brilliant, the themes present, some humor (though I don't like rude humor) there and lyricism is there too. I'll state an example of lyricism: The scene where Hiccup and Toothless get along and become friends, accompanied by the theme that plays within the scene, isn't that just both wonderful and lyrical (But not verbal) storytelling? As I have stated above, I didn't enjoy myself during my viewing of the film. But here's a film that's devoid of bad language, bad content and many of the other stuff that adults often want. Unlike The Social Network (2010), which contains a lot of adult content, this one entertains children well. Just think: Wouldn't we prefer this harmless one rather than an entertaining but harmful one? This one perhaps is even more memorable than The Social Network (2010). Which one do you prefer? I prefer the one that can teach and entertain rather than the one that only entertains with the bad stuff. Now, perhaps during my viewing of The Social Network I was reminded of how smart the dialogue was, it can let you enjoy yourself, but that's just that. But for How to Train Your Dragon (2010)? It'll teach you a deep message while letting you enjoy yourself too.  Hiccup is different from the other Vikings in the film, and he was looked down upon by many of the villagers of Berk. But then he changed not only his bad habits and bad behavior, but also the whole Dragon problem at Berk. We aren't supposed to look down upon anyone, no matter who they are. Instead we should respect them, no matter what they are.  People will realize that this film is both memorable and breathtaking to watch, and they will see for themselves what greatness this film has.", "Sweet, fun movie. A viking boy, Hiccup, is hardly your average viking. Weak, and quite useless at fighting, he is often the brunt of jokes in his village. Unfortunately, his father is the chief of the village, and that just makes things worse. Then he befriends a massive dragon. Dragons are the sworn enemies of his village... Good fun with a sweet, feel-good message. Didn't always look that way: in the beginning it seemed like your average animated action movie. However, from a point (that point being where he meets the dragon), things kick up a gear. The movie then becomes a story about a boy and his dragon friend / pet, and this adds a another dimension to the plot. Good animation and decent voice work, though not sure why all the adults had to be Scottish...", "We should always wish for the stars, never knowing what is in store for us. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a delicious adventure with a beautiful and touching story about the importance of being true to yourself, never giving up when the going gets tough. The 3D visuals are amazing, and unlike in many other animations - almost necessary to grasp the beauty of the whole production. This movie makes you hold on to your seat so you won't fly away with enthusiasm and awe. The music is powerful and the dialogs are never dull or silly. It's quite original, funny, emotional and, most importantly, fun to watch. I loved it from the beginning to the end. Fun, fun, fun!", "Love this cartoon. It's best. Very interesting. I have enjoyed a lot. Very best part is when they become friends. Director have done a good job. And characters are awesome. I've been watch ten times. And I will watch it ten times more. I recommended to all my friends. Regards! How to Train Your Dragon is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated action-fantasy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures.1 Loosely based on the British book series of the same name by Cressida Cowell, the film was directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, the duo who directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch. It stars the voices of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The story takes place in a mythical Viking world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at at last gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer wants to kill it and instead befriends it. The film was released March 26, 2010 and was a critical and commercial success, earning acclaim from film critics and audiences and earning nearly $500 million worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to Toy Story 3 and The Social Network, respectively. The movie also won ten Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature. A sequel, How to Train Your Dragon 2, was written and directed by Dean DeBlois and released on June 13, 2014 and was also universally acclaimed and a box office success. A second sequel, How to Train Your Dragon 3 is to be released on June 29, 2018. The film's success has also inspired other merchandise, including a video game and a TV series.", "I watched this movie with my grandma three years ago. I chose it because of the positive reviews I came upon before deciding to record it on HBO HD.  I couldn't have chosen a better movie to watch with my favorite person in the world. \"How to train your Dragon\" is perhaps the most emotional movie for kids in recent times; and the best thing about it, is that it can be enjoyed by adults.  The animation is amazing, breathtaking, cannot say anything better about it. The soundtrack is also flawless as well as the direction. However, the script is the best feature about it because it constantly evolves and displays a very powerful and positive message for the younger.", "This movie tells people that friends are fantastic, and I was impressed with their friendship. Vikings and dragons always fought, nevertheless they tried to realize each other. Hiccup touched, looked at, and learned about dragons, and he changed his thought about dragons. Dragons were not enemies, and people and dragons can understand each other. I was thoroughly excited at a scene that Toothless was flying as he/she rode Hiccup on his/her back. I felt as if I were lying a sky when I watched the scene. Hiccup and Toothless become best friends. Hiccup was a weakling, but he got courage because of Toothless. I think a feeling of considering friends can turn into a power, courage, and kindness. This movie also tells people that. I recommend this movie to you if you want to watch something exciting. A scene that the black dragon were flying and fighting is very exciting. You will like this movie when you watch it.", "I had watched \"How.To.Train.Your.Dragon\" last night on my phone and I found it as a real good movie!!! The visuals were just amazing and bit epic and the direction designed is also real good. In the first 15 minutes the film was somewhat boring but when \"Hiccup\" meets the dragon and the friendship training and all that elements starts the movie just gone amazing till the end!!! And this film is a perfect fit for a 3D adventure family movie totally a paid off adventure in theatres. Overall the film was amazing and superb and also worth watchable and main thing is it is a bit Unforgettable movie!!", "The world would probably be a better place, if all children watched How to Train Your Dragon. The story of the animated film demonstrates, among other things, that (1) parents are not always right, (2) the self-evident truths in a society may very well be false, and the established practices inspired from them equally misguided, (3) societies sometimes consider their enemies inherently evil, due to a lack of empathy, if not projective identification, (4) animosities may come to an end if people try to view their enemies through different lenses, and develop different attitudes toward them, and (5) enemies today may become friends tomorrow, especially if one stops pointing a weapon at them, and extends a hand. In all, How to Train Your Dragon makes it clear that we live in a world of our own making. We take it over from those who came before us, along with the values they created it with. Still, we can make it a better place if we take up the challenge to question these values, and replace them with better ones. The final scenes of the film are a demonstration of such a better world, where the seemingly-perpetual state of war is no more, and peaceful coexistence prevails. Serdar Kaya", "How to Train Your Dragon (2010): Dir: Dean DeBlois, Chris Sanders / Voices: Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Furguson, America Ferrera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse: CGI film about facing fears. Set ages ago when dragons ruled the earth. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup whose father is disappointed that he didn't become the famed dragon slayer he became. Central plot regards Hiccup's capture, release and friendship with a small dragon. Now it is up to Hiccup to prove to his father and others that they can live amongst dragons without fear. Superbly animated with detailed dragons of all sorts of shapes and sizes. Directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders are backed with a humorous script that only disappoints in its predicted ending. Baruchel brings great enthusiasm and humour to Hiccup's personality. We know that he will prove himself and his father will be proud and he will win the affections of the girl, but Baruchel is quite amusing. Gerard Butler voices his father, a champion Viking who has high hopes for his son but will see his son in a whole new light by conclusion. Other characters include Craig Furguson who voices a Viking with a peg leg and a hook. America Ferrera voices the tough female character whom Hiccup is interested in. She suspects him and will become the first to befriend him after a rough start. Other characters are flat and appear more as a great animation than a broad character with a background. Beautifully animated with a predictable yet entertaining story. It is pointless fun for children that will appeal to adults as well. Score: 7 \u00bd / 10", "I love this movie. I can't believe it took me so many years to watch it. It's definitely not just for children. My Dad watched this and actually liked it so much he was happy to watch the sequel. This movie is adorable and I want Toothless to be my dragon. I even made a Build- A-Bear of him and he is just as adorable as ever. This movie takes place in a world where dragons are real and are a giant threat to the way the vikings live. Everyone is raised to hate them, and after they terrorize their village, they go on the hunt. Hiccup, a young viking who wants to be a dragon hunter, finds the rarest dragon ever, but soon realizes that the dragon is not evil, in fact, he's sweet, caring and protective. And adorable. Hiccup tries to convince his village of this fact, but no one buys it. Once everyone discovers that the dragons have been stealing their food and animals to give to their dragon leader, who's real scary, the village changes their mind about dragons. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.", "How to Train Your Dragon is one of the best animated movie i have ever watched. the Special effects , visuals, writing and voicework, Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways. A young and inexperienced son seeking approval of a strong father is an often-told tale. Sons often act foolishly trying to impress their fathers. And fathers often ignore the strivings of their sons. In this case, there is honor and courage on all sides and it is inspiring to watch the father and son wrestle with their relationship. This is one of the best films so far in this genre and it has been made with passion rather than thrown together to cash-in on the thirst for these films, right now. I would urge all ages to see this film and you can't help but be charmed by it all.", "When I heard they were combining making film about dragons and Vikings, I was beyond excited. Having never read the book, I had no idea what to expect. And I can honestly say, that I was completely blown away. First, it must be said that the absolute star of the film, was the animation. I saw the film when it came out on DVD and even then the angles looked incredible, I imagine it would be beyond incredible if you see the film in 3D or on Blu-Ray. The amount of detail the animators put in to make the dragons seem as different as possible was unbelievable, to the point where you could barley believe that these were all different types of the same animal. The amount of personality that they gave Toothless in terms of body and facial expressions made him one of the most likable animal characters in film (at least in my opinion). The human characters were awesome as well. Jay Baruchel was one of the most perfectly made casting decisions since Jodi Benson was cast as Ariel in The Little Mermaid. He embodies the film's moral (which is a great one) that to be different is to make a difference. Stoick the Vast was a great character, and I felt that one could really sympathize with his morale dilemma; he has a responsibility as the chief was well as an understandable prejudice that will eventually cause him to (temporarily) disown his son and you see the good in him when he comes to the revelation that he was wrong. There are also other likable characters voiced by the like of Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig amongst others. As I said earlier, the best bit of the film was the moral. I feel it could really speak to children (and possibly to teenagers to a degree) that being different, standing out from the crowd could give someone an even better chance to make a difference. Something I strongly believe in. Overall, How To Train Your Dragon is brilliant and I could not find a single thing wrong with it.", "How to Train Your Dragon is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated fantasy film by DreamWorks Animation loosely based on the British book series of the same name by Cressida Cowell.

While his father Stoick is big, strong and tough, Hiccup is small and wimpy. While other Vikings are battling their archenemies, the dragons, with swords and catapults, Hiccup is designing mechanical devices to protect the village from the reptiles. While the other Viking kids fight fires in the village when attacked by dragons, Hiccup is stuck manning the blacksmith shop. In short, he doesn't fit in. When Hiccup tests one of his dragon fighting devices in battle, he manages to take down one of the most deadly and rare dragons known to the Vikings. But when faced with the option of killing the wounded creature, he finds himself unable to do so. Not only that, he starts studying and helping the creature survive and regain flight. Hiccup soon learns that everything they thought about dragons was completely wrong. But when the world of the Vikings and the dragons collide again, which side will Hiccup take? How To Train Your Dragon is by far one of the best animated movies I've seen, it reminded me so much of Eragon, i recommend this movie for you people that loves vikings and dragons.", "This movie brings childhood back to life , remember when once we're a little kid imagines about dragons , fairy tales , etc. Simply recommended to watch with anyone. An amazing design of the characters , the dragons to be exact. The dragons are all amazing. Anyone would love to watch this movie , I recommend you to watch it with your kids. Your kids would love the dragons and how good the relationship between the dragons and the trainers. The time taking of the film is perfect , around medieval era , with swords , ships , viking , make the dragons blend even more into this world. Well, even if it was medieval era , the producers should make the characters more beautiful. it's an unfortunate that the characters ( trainers ) are not as cool as the dragons.", "Spoiler alert. Surely the bravest, most progressive and ethically sound children's film to emerge out of the animated feature genre (Wall-e being a close second), as it champions diversity, eco-awareness and tolerance.  Based on the book by Cressida Cowell, the film takes place on the island of Berk, and is set in a fictional Viking-based era, notably different because it is populated with dragons and other mythological beasts. This conceit is not particularly original, indeed it runs the risk of being hackneyed given the slew of recent fantasy films; the fresh spark which ignites this CGI feature animation, however, is the sophistication of the story, characterisation and themes.  The protagonist is a misfit because he doesn't fit the identity expected of him from his father and the tribe: that of a warrior. Instead he is a clumsy but brainy, sensitive, progressive thinker who displays the traits of a budding inventor, tirelessly questioning the society and traditions surrounding him. It is this quizzical nature that finds him befriending a dragon, which is sacrilegious to the tribe and their values. These beautifully simple metaphors for institutional racism and other prejudices raise the film up beyond its CGI feature contemporaries.  The humour is delicate, genuine, well observed, cleverly written, and beautifully acted and animated. It would take the iciest of hearts not to fall in love with the irresistibly cute dragon who is trained and befriended by Hiccup. Toothless, the dragon, has one tail fin shorter than the other, and so mirrors the protagonist's outcast status. The film champions these different traits, and presents a message of diversity, even depicting the hero waking after the final battle to find that he has lost a leg. This theme of disability is seldom touched upon in children's entertainment, and is done in this instance with integrity and humour without straying into sentimentality or clich\u00e9.  This film is full of wisdom despite its target audience, which is a welcome development in children's cinema as they too demand high quality content, which they have here in spades. How To Train Your Dragon is a 'how to' for all the other CGI animation production companies out there, and shows that younger audiences do appreciate a little finesse; and cool dragons, of course.", "This movie was a blast ! It's funny and adventurous and you can't possibly get bored for 1 second. Besides the clever lines and witty jokes, I was impressed by how the story unravels many level of emotions. It's not about spitting fire dragons and angry vikings, it's about friendship, family, trust, tradition and courage. It is a lesson for every viewer of any age. This movie shows us that learning how to think for yourself and trust your own instincts and feelings is much more important than what the entire world says or thinks. It's a must see! Enjoy !", "When I first saw the trailer of How To Train Your Dragon I didn't have much confidence to actually see the movie. Luckily I had someone who persuaded me seeing the movie still, and I must say I am glad that I did. The trailer doesn't give the movie much justice, as it misleads the true overall theme of the movie and gives you the wrong impression on how the movie should be interpreted. The story line is very creative and compels you to watch it continuously. The sound is spot on and the visuals are on such an interactive level that will make you experience it to the fullest of what a movie should deliver. I yearn to the sequels and I am hoping the sequels of this movie will deliver the same amount of joy as this movie did. I cannot stress enough on seeing this in 3D, as it gives you that extra boost in getting all the beneficial visuals of the movie. If you like movies with all the packages a movie should have, then this is a must see.", "Ah, How to Train your Dragon... Dreamwork's surprise masterpiece. And if you've seen it, the next surprise is that it manages to take elements which could have made this movie clich\u00e9d and disappointing and do them right. This movie has excellent execution and pacing. Its characters are all likable and memorable. Its nonhuman main, Toothless ranks up there with the best silent animal leads in film. The CGI is absolutely breathtaking and the music even more so. The only complaint I can think of is that the reveal near the end doesn't make total sense. But in the whole, this is an excellent film for all ages. Dreamwork's has arguably been in a slump since its early Shrek days. With this, they show they can contend with Pixar in storytelling.", "Movies like this are my weakness. I just love animation family-movies with cute creatures, can't help it. The 8/10 is only because the animation felt a little bit too raw at some parts, but overall it's a lot of hard work and it looks gorgeous. I honestly didn't mind these minor visual details just because the story itself was so fantastic. Clearly they did their research about vikings and animals behavior (two things that for some reason I know a lot about - I never even realized that about myself). I love how Hiccup's voice is changing when he's speaking, like a real teenage boy. Some of the sweetest character designs ever (I clearly saw how Lilo&Stitch inspired at least a few of them, but Lilo&Stitch has one of the most beautiful designs I've ever seen - so that is actually a serious compliment). All the characters had a very complete personality, and without words, the first act makes you fall in love with the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. Sweet movie and highly recommended!", "Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his village is constantly attacked by dragons. Weakling Hiccup isn't much help. He befriends an injured dragon missing part of his tail fin. He helps it by making a prosthetic tail. In the meanwhile, he becomes a great study of dragons. Instead of fighting them, he's able to subdue them. DreamWorks has created a beautiful 3D animation. The story is a beautiful one of friendship between the boy and the dragon. Jay Baruchel is really terrific as the geeky boy. The whole group of kids have real charisma. I especially like the training sessions, and how the boy's relationship with the dragon pays off.", "I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I really didn't expect it to be so good. I've been recommending it to everyone because it was such an amazing and beautifully animated film. For those of you who haven't watched it its something you need to add on to your watchlist because you are missing out. The characters in this film were so lovable and this is a film that I'm not going to easily forget and I'm so glad to hear that they are going to be making a second I will definitely be going to see it. I can't really see how anyone could dislike this movie its suitable for all ages. Again I will say this that this film is a must", "it is one of best 3 D animation moves. not for technique option but for the training of impressive cinema fashion by story. a touching, lovely, well - crafted story, far by historical facts but that remains a so insignificant detail. a film who is, in same measure, more than a good show and an useful lesson. it is a form of magic who not desires to seduce but only discover another side of life. voices, dialogs, animation itself are a provocation for an industry who seems be clean-cut. and the trick is a small one - the measure , the message , the fresh air and the flavor of an old game in new clothes. it is not exactly for children or adults. it is for entire family. and for a secret age who is basic source for dreams and hope, joy and adventure projects. really must see it !", "Ever since Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron, Dreamworks has held a special place in my heart. This is the perfect family movie; the kids love the dragon and the story, adults love all the humour. Simply saying the name 'Jay Baruchel' says it all. If you love sarcasm, you will love this movie. I first saw it when I was 17. Now I'm 21, and still as excited about the impeding sequel as I was (about the possibility of there being one) when I first saw this in theatres. It's a quirky adventure, one that is light enough to entertain a kid, but touching enough to draw in adults that claim they don't \"do kids movies\". My middle-aged mom already \"put in her time\" with such movies, but when she saw this she fell in love. She doesn't even like dragons, let alone fantasy. The only movie I can think of that equates to just how great HTTYD is would be Shrek.", "Excellent voices, portrayal, and execution of a movie. To begin though, let's have a few negatives towards it. The ending felt a bit abrupt, and the T.v. series that ensued. Don't get me wrong, it was still enjoyable though. An animated masterpiece, well budgeted, characters even, though not without the traditional clich\u00e9s'. Each character in this story shares some sort of importance, whether small or large. The concept as well, is heart warming, wondrous, and eye appealing. This is a movie to be see, for all ages, and some can even find the characters relatable.", "This was it. It is simply a beautiful movie with lovable, relatable characters and a surprising yet symbolic ending. I watched this just last year and even then the animation was beautiful (if outdated by today's standard) and detailed just right. The story line is sweet and somewhat predictable with charming lines thrown in there. \"Duh DA Dar, we're dead\" \"Thanks for nothing... you useless reptile\" I've seen a lot of movies, most of which, after a couple watches I will get sick of them and not watch them for another 4 to 5 years, by which time I will likely find something better to watch. This has been my only exception. I could watch this any day and still love it.", "I like this movie. There's a many expressive details,cool graphics. I'd named it \"extraodinari\" and emotional.I really enjoyed. Cool dragons - cute,funny and mighty ones.I also liked that fabulous world of vikings. Hiccup is a zingy character.And his friends cool too. One of the points of this movie is a big and strong friendship. So,it's not only amazing entertainment,but exemplary for children especially. I wish you all a wonderful trip with the Vikings! This story impressed me.The behavior of the characters strong and desperate. It teaches to be kind, brave, and never give up.So,it was great to fly with dragons in that wonderful world!", "Ever since 'Shrek', Dreamworks have been giving us the standard \"hip, pop-culture savvy\" type of animated film. It was fun for a while, but the trope got really old after a couple of years. It wasn't until 'Kung-Fu Panda' did we get an almost-serious animated Dreamworks film again, then came a little film called 'How to Train Your Dragon'. When I first saw the teaser for this film, I just rolled my eyes and said, \"Pfft, no one will take this film seriously, the dragons look too silly and the Vikings seem boring\". Guess what? I was dragged to the theater with my mother and grandmother to see this thing, and I didn't like it........I LOVED IT!!! This is the kind of movie I've been waiting for! A refreshing callback to the classic fantasy films, namely 'E.T.', 'The NeverEnding Story', and 'The Iron Giant'. It's got everything I love about those films: drama, tasteful humor, intense action scenes, a sympathetic main character, and above all...HEART! It's not the most original fantasy film, but once you get sucked into the environment, and attached to the characters, you'll hardly notice. Toothless is adorable, Stoic and Gobber are pretty cool, and the Rookie Vikings are very funny. Now, Hiccup and Astrid are very basic when it comes to characters. Astrid is the typical tomboy love interest, and Hiccup is your standard rookie/underdog hero, but once you learn their backgrounds and their motives, you'll start to enjoy them. So, while it might be a generic story, it's still a very beautiful, touching, thrilling adventure that I DID NOT regret seeing in theaters (and the 3-D was totally worth it)! My Overall Score-- A solid 10!", "Even 3 years later this is still my favourite animated movie. Everything is just fantastic. The setting, the characters, the dragons (especially the dragons) Toothless being my favourite. He was a lovable character from the start just like most of the characters. The fact that this film is based on a successful children's book is even better because then you know it's going to be a good film for the family. Spoiler Alert, I also find it pretty good how the main character, Hiccup, went from being a nobody to the person that ended the war between the Vikings and the dragons.  Anyway this is a fantastic film, fun for all the family, I would highly recommend it. 10/10", "Films to me are what make life. Films are adventure and to me show that the world isn't all bad people.....if masterpieces like this are created by humans then how are we all bad? I watched this film first when I was 13 years old and yet this film somehow takes me back to my childhood because it's just so enlightening and sweet and represents that you can't judge a book by it's cover. A dragon's not always a fire breathing monster and a nerdy, lanky kid isn't always useless. A nerdy, lanky kid is sometimes what this world needs. This film is based around a 13 year old Viking named \"Hiccup\" who is the son of hard headed leader Viking \"Stoick the vast\" who appears to disapprove of his son and how he's more imagination less brutal force. Hiccup is the outcast of the village due to him being clumsy and impulsive and he appears to posses no qualities a typical Viking does so he is always locked away in \"Gobber's\" workshop whilst the other young Vikings- \"Astrid,\" \"Snotlout,\" \"Tuffnut,\" \"Ruffnut\" and \"Fishlegs\" put out fires....not just figuratively. One day Hiccup leaves the workshop during a dragon attack on the village and using a contraption created by Gobber and himself he catches the rarest dragon of all...a night fury. Which no one has ever seen. He then goes and finds this dragon and at first his instincts is to kill him so he tries to he grabs his knife and aims it at the dragon's chest with his eyes closed....but then he opens then and looks at the night fury's big green eye. You can see the fear in both characters eyes at that moment and can see the link between the two. He is sympathetic so he cuts the dragon free and lets him go and the dragon drags Hiccup to a rock and holds him there just staring aggressively at Hiccup and then he leaves and he leaves Hiccup unharmed. This action contradicts everything Vikings have ever known about dragons. My favourite scene in this film happens at about half an hour in and Hiccup walks into an area where \"Toothless\" the dragon is carrying a shield and a fish. The shield gets stuck between 2 rocks. Toothless walks up to Hiccup aggressively which makes Hiccup drop his knife on the ground and kick it into the water. Hiccup then gives Toothless the fish but at first sees that he has no teeth.....this is where his name comes from. He then retracts his teeth and eats the fish and then crowds Hiccup close to a rock like he did when they first met that terrifies Hiccup but Toothless then spits out a part of the fish on Hoccup's lap. Toothless then sits like the way a dog would and looks from the fish to Hiccup so Hiccup eats a little bit of the fish and smiles awkwardly. Toothless then tries to smile back so Hiccup leans in to try and stroke Toothless but Toothless gets angry and backs away and then flies away and hides under his own tail but Hiccup follows him and sits by him and attempts to stroke his tail but Toothless lifts it to see Hiccup so he awkwardly walks away. Toothless then sleeps upside down on a tree but then sees Hiccup sitting on a rock drawing in the soil with a stick and we see that he is drawing Toothless and Toothless sees this too and so grabs a stick and starts drawing squiggly lines on the ground around where Hiccup is sitting when he stops Hiccup stands up and looks around himself in amazement and then starts walking and steps on one of the lines which causes Toothless to growl. He then steps over the line into the gaps between the line and keeps doing this until he runs into Toothless backwards. He then turns around and tries to touch his nose again but Toothless growls so Hiccup closes his eyes and puts his hand out there aimed at Toothless' face but he can't see anything. He is completely vulnerable. Toothless then leans into Hiccup's hand and closes his eyes. The soundtrack during this bit is so beautiful and magical and makes me actually cry happy tears every time I watch it. It's too beautiful for words. I am so thankful that in this world full of disasters and a world slowly losing it's innocence that a film full of such beautiful moments and beautiful themes and full of the idea that we all have a place in this world and that not everything is as it seems. I am quite a cynical film reviewer and I cannot find a flaw in this masterpiece. All cast are stunningly perfect, all characters are amazing, the animation and cinematography is magical. This film is just....wow and no matter how many times I watch it I am always amazed with the scripting and the soundtrack. Seriously anyone involved with this film should be insanely proud of themselves. SEE IT!! Trust me. It's beautiful.", "It's been a since that I have seen this movie, so the other day I popped in the blu ray. Man oh man, what a movie. It reminded me again what my favorite animated movie is.  First of all, the voice cast is great. Gerard Butler steals the show as Stoick the Vast. Jay Baruchels voice really creates the social outcast appearance that his character Hiccup has in the movie. Second: The animation. I doesn't get much better. The iris of Toothless eye is a perfect example, so much detail.  These 2 facts get backed up by a lot of humor, a good story, a great score, romance and best of all, a lot of excitement.  This movie should have been the winner for the Academy Award for best animated feature, not Toy Story 3... The Lion King used to be my favorite animated movie, move over Simba, here's Toothless!!!", "I can't get over how much I like this movie. It's exciting, it's visually beautiful, it's heartwarming, it's atmospheric... it's everything I want to see in a movie. It has strong characters and a strong message about not judging others by their appearance. The acting is superb and the writing is incredible. I like to call this movie a clich\u00e9 cocktail done right. The clich\u00e9s in the plot are high in number but I feel like this is exactly how they should be handled and, unfortunately, most movies put them in for dramatic effect or to force the audience to feel bad for the characters. In this movie, you already love the characters because they're written in such a way that you get to know them pretty fast and already like them even though some of them bully Hiccup, the hero. So the clich\u00e9s are done more realistically. You see the pain the characters are in, you feel their triumph, you feel everything. And that's what this movie has more than anything else, it has atmosphere. It sucks you in and pulls at the heartstrings. The animation is breathtaking. The flying scenes look fantastic, you really feel like you're flying with them. But something else that stands out about this movie is the soundtrack. It is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. I will always say Pixar is better than Dreamworks. But How to Train Your Dragon is, in my opinion, just a tiny bit better than any of the Pixar films. But only a little bit. It's a shame Dreamworks hasn't come out with a movie this good since. I take comfort in knowing that there will be a sequel and I'm optimistic about the sequel because the TV show based on this movie is also quite good. I spoke to someone recently and asked him if he had ever seen this movie. He said he \"didn't like kids movies like that.\" This is the kind of movie that should at least remind you that just because it's animated and child friendly doesn't mean it's juvenile or below adults. If you haven't seen it, I don't care how old you are, see it. This is a movie for everyone.", "This has to be one of the better animation stories. Immensely absorbing watch for fun-time with family or friends, adults or un-adults.  The dragon himself is probably the best, most minutely defined character and Jay Baruchel is very characteristically yet appealingly himself. The voices (and accents)of Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson add all the charm in the world to otherwise plainly stubborn Viking warriors.  Nothing path-breaking about the animation given today's standards but on the whole the movie relies heavily on a good story, engaging characters, a decent screenplay and great voice acting. It is best to keep in mind that film story is vastly different from the book series by Cressida Cowell, on which it is said to be based. Also worth a watch are the 3 short films that are part of the franchise, namely: The Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon, The Book of Dragons and The Gift of the Night Fury.", "Hiccup; Is a young Viking living on the island of Berk; he dreams of fighting dragons like the other Vikings; unfortunately he isn't muscular or talented in that field\u0085 much to his father's disappointment. One day during a dragon attack he tries to join in with a home made device. He claims to have hit a dreaded night-fury dragon but nobody believes him\u0085 why would they; nobody has ever killed or even clearly seen a night-fury. The next day he goes out and finds the downed night-fury; he intended to kill it but when he can't as the dragon doesn't appear to be dangerous. He dubs the creature Toothless and gradually befriends it. When he attends dragon fighting school he uses the skills he has learnt dealing with Toothless to come top of the class. While showing Toothless to classmate Astrid they go on a flight that takes them to the dragons' nest where a huge dragon resides. When Hiccup's father learns this he takes Toothless captive and uses him to find the nest\u0085 unfortunately he has bitten off more than he can chew and he will have to rely on Hiccup and his class to save the day using Hiccup's new dragon-friendly techniques. Dreamworks' animations have a reputation for being over-filled with pop culture references and jokes that are aimed squarely at the older viewer; thankfully that isn't the case here; there are one or two moments that could have been nods to other films but nothing that requires the viewer to have a knowledge of other films to enjoy this. The story is enjoyably and the characters are a lot of fun. The animation looked good and in the action scenes it was quite spectacular as Hiccup and Toothless swoop through sea stacks and when the huge dragon appears to set the sky ablaze. Some of the action may be a little scary for younger children but I'm sure older children will really enjoy this\u0085 and plenty of adults will too.", "This is one of the best movies of the decade. Dreamworks did a wonderful job on it, mostly because it is easy for adults, as well as kids to relate to, and there are lessons present for all age groups. The animation was great, the story was great, and the actors used for characters' voices were just right for what the role called for. As with any good movie, every detail is important in its own way, from things that a viewer can't miss, to the little things that can easily go unnoticed. On top of all of these things, the music by John Powell finished it off. Perfectly composed for the movie, the score can tell the story without needing to see the actual movie. So overall, this movie was truly well made, and is worth seeing time and time again.", "Dragons have always been my favorite creature in the fantasy genre; it's hard to say why may'be the fact they can breath fire, their size, or just simply their ability to fly. Seeing things like that makes it feel as though there is more to this world than just contemporary reality we take for granted. There really aren't many movies on dragons, let alone good ones; this film that flew into my radar was the beast I was looking for. The visuals and the animation is just great. From the background, humans but most importantly the dragons. The dragons are memorable they don't look cartoony, I like the great amount of detail to them but also that each of them are diverse. But I most of all just love how their handled making them like animals; from the way they move, but also behave and each of them feel like they have a distinctive diverse persona. The flight sequences are spectacular, they successfully created the illusion of flight at times you almost feel like your flying with them. My favorite flight sequence is the one with both Astrid and Hiccup flying together, just what you see along with a wonderful score it's just breathtaking. But what makes this film fly high for me is that the story does have some heart, which actually makes you care for what happens. I also like the fact this film is more of a straight forward fantasy and not so much a comedy despite some humor which is something I'm rarely seeing in most animated movies. Hiccup (Jay Barnchel) I think is a very good protagonist, I like the fact his character is an underdog, doesn't really fit in. But what's great about him is the fact he's a person ahead of his time, he's an inventor kinda like \"Batman\" (I said kinda). From that siege weapon he built but also the flight controls he built for the dragon and it's aero dynamic principles. Insightful as he finds and utilizes better and more non lethal ways to stop the dragons, without one or both getting killed. He's ill confidant but he's never short of courage. Supporting characters are also good, the one that really stands out for me is Astrid (America Ferrera) I just love how she is just feisty and fiery but has warmth. I really like the chemistry between both of them; it's funny how at first like in most romances it's the classic case of misunderstanding she sees Hiccup has sort of a competitor thinking he's trying to one up, even though in reality he really isn't and he fancys her. But of course when she's disillusioned by the misunderstanding , well you can guess what happens next. But the primary chemistry no doubt is with the dragon Toothless, he's my favorite dragon in the movie. I just love the jet black color, but most of all his design as he looks even acts a bit like a cat. I really like the persona it has, one distinct personality feature it has is it's sense of curiosity as it observes some of what Hiccup does he tries to imitate it, this feature is one of the reasons both of them click is Hiccup is also curious which was part of the reason he helped the dragon. Both of them slowly but surely warm up to each other which is touching because of the amount of humanity both have. How to Train you Dragon flies high. Rating: 3 and a half stars.", "I never saw How to Train Your Dragon in the theater. However, I did watch it when it came out on DVD. Having not heard much about the film and not knowing anything about its story or any of that, I didn't have any expectations prior to watching it. However, I ended up loving it. In fact, in my opinion, DreamWorks has surpassed Pixar with this film. The story is very simple, predictable, derivative, and clich\u00e9d, and it's a total retread of basic cinema clich\u00e9s, but it works, and I found it entertaining and immersive. There is not much depth, story development, or character development, but it's still pretty effective as it is. Also, the wonderful animation helps contribute to the emotion and energy of the story. So, overall, to sum this up, this film works in many of the same ways that James Cameron's Avatar worked, and in fact it works much better. They both consist of simple, predictable, and clich\u00e9d stories. They don't have much depth, story development, or character development (like I just said above). However, the stories are sufficient, well-structured, well-paced, and coherent, and they flow and make sense. The characters are not developed much, but they are sufficient and very likable. Also, both use brilliant visuals and keen detail to tell their stories and bring emotion into them. Although I do have to admit that HTTYD has a somewhat better script and better dialogue. Also, like Avatar, HTTYD doesn't go much into the depth and backgrounds of the characters, or much into any of that stuff, but a lot of that stuff - character background, personality, relationships, etc. - are evident in the detail. So, given all of this, I think it would be safe to say that, in many ways, HTTYD is the Avatar of 2010. Now, HTTYD doesn't have a new world, like Pandora, but it does have beautiful scenery all the same. Also, it has the lovable dragon Toothless, who is a full character in the film. He was excellently designed, and is very cute and lovable. In addition to excellent physical design, has a great personality, is smart, and has an excellent balance between that of a person and that of an animal. He is a great character, and, in fact, the most memorable character in the film. The voice actors all put on good performances, and they really help bring out their characters with their voice. Jay Baruchel did a very good job as Hiccup. A lot of people say that his voice is annoying, but I personally disagree. I actually kind of like his voice, and it's just right for the character in the movie, Hiccup, who is very likable. The other voice actors did an equally good job with their characters too, such as Gerard Butler as Stoick the Vast, America Ferrera as the likable and beautiful Astrid (Hiccup's love interest), Jonah Hill as Snotlout, and some others. Like I said before, the animation is absolutely beautiful. John Powell composed and excellent music score for the film. As for the target audience: everyone - in many ways, it's like a kids movie, but in others it's pretty mature. Also, being a good comedy, it has some good humor. But it doesn't let the humor get too abundant. The humor is spaced out throughout the film and given at appropriate intervals, and is balanced excellently with the story, drama, emotion, and moral messages, much like The Iron Giant was. In fact, the film has a lot of similarities to The Iron Giant, and it works for many of the same reasons that movie works. Everything about the movie is very well balanced. Overall, I love this movie. It's a great family film, it's very entertaining, touching, good- hearted, and visually beautiful. It combines elements of The Iron Giant and Avatar, and breathes new life into old, exhausted clich\u00e9s. Also, it has great staying power - it's one of those movies, like Ghostbusters, that never really gets old on repeated viewings. Unfortunately, DreamWorks plans to make a sequel to it. Wow, way to go, DreamWorks, ruining the best film you've ever made. Please don't make that sequel. This is the type of movie that's just best left alone. Leave a good thing alone. One final note: I've only seen this movie in 2-D. I've never seen it in 3-D, and guess what? I don't want to. Aside from the usual fact that 3-D is unnecessary, this movie is so awesome that it doesn't need 3-D. My Rating: **** (out of ****) For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com", "Dreamworks Animation astounds yet again. Unfortunately for me, the title was a turn off for more than a year after it was released. I thought it was going to be something more suited to the kiddies, with little to engage the adults. I could NOT have been more wrong. This is hands down, no ifs ands or buts about it, can ya gimme hallelujah my FAVORITE animated feature film of all time. It was magnificently designed, the characters were wonderful, but Toothless was a beautiful and sublime revelation. He was a pretty significant departure from the book's description of him, but just wonderful to look at. The subtle scales, the detail of the irises, his expressions, the bunching muscles as he launched into flight, the moment he and Hiccup first connected... ahhhh, such heady, wonderful stuff. The dragons were all wonderful (especially the big baddie at the end). Just incredible. The detail in the human clothing and hair...I could go on and on and on. Eek. This review is giving me withdrawals for the film. I must go watch it again. Anyway, carrying on... The setting was also extraordinary. The sky, the towering rock formations, the trees...and the fire? Wow wow wow wow. But what REALLY affected me was the WATER. I've been waiting for an animation studio to get the water right for decades, and Dreamworks did. I felt I could walk up to my screen and get splashed. They nailed the color of the sea in all her moods. The waves, the crests, it was just amazing. Hold on to your seat when Hiccup and Toothless go for their first major spin. You may want a sling for your jaw, or it might fall off. Wonderful acting all around. Craig Ferguson gets a special mention for being so lively. Jay Baruchel? Never heard of him, and didn't have high hopes for his acting style when the movie first started, but he knocked my socks off within about 2 minutes, and kept on knocking. Gerard Butler was good right from the gate, and the actors playing Hiccup's peers all did a fine job as well. Some issues I had? Slightly wooden human character movements, and the difference in accent between kids and adults was a bit of a head-scratcher. The storyline was of course predictable, but I don't consider that much of an issue. Perhaps the fact that I was able to stop watching it on HBO 3 times a day after only a few months? Hmm. Nope. Not an issue. I still love it, I bought the DVD the same day I saw it for the first time, and I'm going to go watch it again when I'm finished ranting about it. Another legendary animated film. Toothless has knocked Smaug (from the '77 full-length animated take on the Hobbit) from his pedestal, and I think he even knocked the Balrog from Peter Jackson's LOTR/FOTR from his, and THAT, my friends, is a mean feat. Both of those other beasts still (and always will) take my breath away, but Toothless is more than just a beast. He has ascended to that rare place where you also love him. I was mesmerized from the first second to the last. My minor quibbles with the film did not detract from my joy of it. 10/10 stars, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up, and when you're ready to watch it, let me know. I may just shove you over to make space on the couch so I can watch it with you. No salt on the popcorn, please. Thanks for reading. Enjoy the film!", "\"How To Train Your Dragon\" was just a delightful movie to see. The movie literally starts with a bang. It jumps right into the action, without the build-up stretching out too long. The action scenes were exciting, and very well-animated. Was it just me, or did the water look SO REAL to you people? Anyway, I really liked Hiccup, the main character. Even though he's different than everybody, and the loser of the tribe, he's quite lovable with his little quirks and his sarcastic humor. When he and the dragon become friends, it had to be one of the sweetest moments I've ever seen in a movie. I left the theater, wanting a dragon of my own! Though I didn't see this movie in 3D, it didn't really matter. I actually had an adrenaline rush whenever Hiccup rode the dragon, Toothless, and swerved between mountain and soared over the clouds. May I add, I thought the dragon was adorable! Another great thing about this movie is that the plot was good; there were no plot holes that I saw. I never got bored, and I never took my eyes off the screen. The humor was great, too, and thankfully, lacking of bathroom jokes. This is a must-see for everyone. If you love sweet, fun, funny, thrilling animated movies, then go see this one. In the future, Dreamworks should look to How to Train Your Dragon when they make their next movie, so they'll have a reference to how an animated movie SHOULD be.", "I did some research after seeing the movie, specifically how the team behind this animation really did their own research - specifically how some animals work. They incorporate cats, dogs, birds, and a small menagerie of other animals into how their dragons act, and it's a fascinating watch. There's very little to say bad about this movie. I loved how pretty much every little thing was relevant. Hiccup's skill comes into play. The one teenage viking who acted like a Dungeons and Dragons player - his nerdy behavior came into play. Everything just... came back and it's nice to see a setting actually remember to use itself, you know? Too many times I watch movies with heroes and villains forgetting that they have certain powers. (For example; Cloud in Advent Children; Why didn't he just use that 'instant kill' move in the very beginning of the fight?) I also liked how the Nightfury didn't befriend Hiccup immediately, as the trailers had me believe. It felt like a realistic portrayal of an animal to human relationship. I was reminded of how a horse doesn't always immediately trust a potential rider until a respectful hand-to- snout happens. (I didn't research that, I just remember seeing it in other media) I loved the sarcastic snark of Hiccup, how his entire life has forced him to use his brain precisely because he didn't have the muscle to back anything else up.  While it was fairly predictable (This is essentially a kids movie after all), it didn't take away from the experience and I'm a sucker for animated movies. It's not perfect, but I don't go in expecting perfection. Definitely worth a watch.", "Dreamworks, congratulations, you have made an amazing movie. Paying more attention to story and characters rather than to the jokes that can be drawn out of them, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" has the soothing feel of a Pixar movie. I can't remember the last time I was sincerely engaged in the obligatory final battle in movies like these where (Spoiler) the underdog hero overcomes the much bigger adversary. (End spoiler) \"How to Train Your Dragon\" takes us to the island of Berk occupied by vicious Vikings that are often visited by those unwelcome, pesky, fire- breathing Dragons. Them Dragons keep taking the livestock of the island of Berk, and the Vikings, as the violent bastards that they are, seek to wipe out the Dragons. You see, the earlier Vikings have passed down their fighting skills, and their hatred for Dragons, from one generation to the other. Killing Dragons seem to be a natural, how do I say this, talent, for the Vikings. Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/train-dragon/", "I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.", "Of all the problems you want in your village, probably the last one would be having dragons destroying your crops and livestock. In How to Train Your Dragon, a wonderful animated film from the DreamWorks studio based on a novel by Cressida Cowell, these pesky creatures ignore the no-fly zone and create havoc in the Viking village of Berk. The film, however, is less about dragon wars than about having the courage to be yourself, even if it means challenging the conventional wisdom. In Berk, the tribal leader Stoick (Gerard Butler), a kind of hairy Hulk Hogan type, wants his slightly-built son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) to follow in his well-trodden footsteps and become a dragon killer, the traditional activity of the Vikings for hundreds of years.  Hiccup, however, doesn't fit the mold and has other ideas that do not include trying to kill anyone, especially the fire-breathing type. Though the father does not think too highly of his son's potential as a Viking warrior, all teens in the village, including Hiccup, are sent to training camp to learn how to best use their clubs and shields in the beasticide. While out in the forest one day, Hiccup uses his own weapon to bring down a \"Night Fury\" species of dragon and thinks he has something to brag about, but the next day when he is out wandering again, he comes upon the wounded green-eyed dragon who is grounded, not because he stayed out too late, but because his wings are injured and he can't fly.  Apparently, Hiccup is guilty of the unpardonable sin of having empathy to go along with an open mind, a no-no in Viking land. He names the dragon \"Toothless\" and brings him food and tends to his wounds. The boy notices that the dragon seems as frightened of him as he is of it and this ability to see the world from the dragon's perspective allows the two to begin to form a bond. Of course, as with other uphill battles against entrenched orthodoxy, convincing others of a new way of looking at things is not easy. The smart and spunky Hiccup uses his keen sense of humor to try and convince his father, the twins Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig) and Tuffnut (T.J. Miller), and especially a young girl in the training class named Astrid (America Ferrera) that the dragons aggressiveness are only their way of defending themselves from being attacked, but his effort is summarily rebuffed. As is inevitable in films for children, there are plenty of battles and here they involve some thrilling flying sequences (I would have liked to have seen them in 3-D). The Viking leaders look for the dragon's nest to try and eliminate their foes once and for all, capturing Toothless to help them find the hiding place. Fearing for Toothless' safety, Hiccup and his teenage pals embark on a rescue mission that includes daring maneuvers between mountain peaks on the backs of dragons. One can only hope that, with the end of the battle, the wars between dragon and man will end, but, if the endless conflicts of today are any indicator, the chances are that the villagers will find another enemy. How to Train Your Dragon is a funny and entertaining film that captures the imagination in a way that some recent children's films fail to do. Though love between man and dragon is a bit out of the mainstream, to see this kind of tender relationship depicted on the screen in any form is indeed welcome. Intelligently written and extremely well performed, the film has moments of genuine compassion and its message is one worth remembering - that it is more nurturing to be yourself and stand up for what you think is right then to try to live up to others expectations.", "It's pretty much just right in every way. Never boring yet never hyper stimulating like a lot of modern animation. And it's innocent, just the way a cartoon should be. You can watch this with your kids without feeling concerned with the innuendos typically thrown into most movies these days, and still fully enjoy it yourself. Good moral, great characters, awesome plot, phenomenal music. I've always liked the idea of dragons and other mythological creatures and this film amplifies that. Basically it's about a teen whose eccentric and open-minded personality doesn't jive with his dragon-killing, brawn-over-brains Viking peers. Desperate to fit in, he becomes determined to do what no Viking has ever done and kill an extremely dangerous Night Fury Dragon. One night he actually succeeds to injure the infamous creature only to discover that dragons aren't at all what he's been led to believe....and it just gets better from there. Love it and would recommend it to anyone!", "When How To Train Your Dragon initially came out in theaters, I was skeptical. Not to say that I don't love a good cartoon or the idea of a fantasy world where such majestic creatures exist (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars happen to be some of my all time favorite films), but the title didn't exactly scream excitement.  But as the old proverbial phrase goes, do not judge a cover by its dragon. If you do in this case, Toothless will immediately win you over. How To Train Your Dragon is not just a movie about teaching a dragon a few new tricks. It's a story about camaraderie, redemption and defying the odds. Those may sound like heavy words for such a light-hearted title, but you will have to watch for yourself if you want to prove me wrong. And I promise, you wont.  The power of the film is undeniable, and it's why my 57-year-old father and I will watch it every time we are lucky enough to find it playing on HBO (I have made myself sound sufficiently weird but I promise I'm a pretty normal 21-year-old). It's a movie that never gets old. The music in the film, written by John Powell, has the ability to move you to utter silence and makes you feel as if you are part of the scene. It's a movie that leaves you yearning for a dragon of your own and cursing the fact that they don't actually exist.  This film is both humbling and hilarious, due to the familiar voices of Gerarld Butler, Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (formerly known as McLovin). Though it sadly lost its 2011 Oscar nomination for Best Animated Film to Toy Story 3 (blasphemy), How to Train Your Dragon is truly one for the ages.", "This is a movie about friendship and trust. it has a very good moral + a very good and extraordinary storyline. this is the best dragon movie i have ever seen . Most of the dragon movies contain too much violence and no story but this movie is the best it contains less violence more story and a long story. this is a movie that never gets old. i keep on watching it . the graphics are great even the 3d. this movie should be watched in 3d compared to all the 3d movies i watched this comes second in my list after avatar 3d. this has great 3d specially in the beginning even my baby cousin watches it with me every time in fascination.Perfect movie for kids also. i would say 4 years old babies could also watch it without being scared.", "I've seen this film almost a month ago. I'm commenting on it now, as a preface to the viewing of Spielberg/Jackson's Tintin. I want to see that film, because I think Spielberg is a valuable filmmaker when he moves inside is native area, that of energetic electrifying adventure films, being \"adventure\" a wide term. I want to see what's his word on motion capture, the concept he so willingly defends, and that his long time friend Zemeckis began to explore a few years ago.  Watching films is, as many things in life, a matter of personal choices. You choose what you are looking for in a film. Animation is subject to those decisions as well. I made my choices. I go to animation because a virtual camera can do things that a real one can't so easily do. Of course we than watch Soy Cuba and this statement becomes pretty much useless. But that film is an alien. As an architect I care about space. Built space, integrated or not, but always built. In an animation, everything is built space. Even mountains and landscapes, the sea and the caves. It's all chosen and designed to appear as we see it. And it is built to look as it does depending on the also freely chosen framing, and movement of characters in the space. So, it's total freedom. Of course this is a several million dollar project, and it has to appeal to a certain crowd, so you hang the thing in a story, and this one is well put. But I don't come to films like this for the characters, although the black dragon does seduce me, as well as a number of other characters. This film is rich in its textures, and character construction, within the constraints of the genre. But I don't want to talk about that. The really good things here for me come from the motion scenes. In the sky, and in the cave. One uses fluid motion, following the path of the dragons or inventing a virtual path for the camera that dances with that of the dragons. In the cave, the camera use is more conventional, but the design of the space is intelligent. Pixar has made the biggest progress in recent years, but this has a specific vision of its own, maybe a consequence, or even an iteration of Avatar. Worth watching on those terms. My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com", "I believe this film has set a new benchmark for DreamWorks pictures. Shrek established them as a top class animation production company but since the first sequel they have not hit the same class of movie but I have to say How To Train Your Dragon has bought it back to the heights Shrek bought them and perhaps even surpassed it. How To Train Your Dragon is a story about Hiccup (Baruchel), the son of a fearsome Viking warrior, Stoick the Vast (Butler). The only problem with Hiccup is despite wanting to be a Viking, he physically can't. Compared to the large physique of the Vikings he is like a pussy cat. Desperate to follow in his Father's footsteps he forces his way into battle against the dragons attacking his home town and shoots down the most dangerous dragon of all, Nightfall. With the town folk not believing his story he sets off to find the dragon he shot down, the dragon that has never been seen before let alone caught, the one dragon the Vikings know nothing about. Hiccup finds the dragon but can't bring himself round to killing it to prove he actually did shoot it down, instead he releases it after seeing the scared look in the dragon's eyes. The dragon reacts furiously and attempts to fly off but his damaged tail means he can't get far and becomes trapped in a gorge. Hiccup, blaming himself, brings the dragon food and a handmade flight he has made to help the dragon fly. From there on in a special bond forms between man and beast and Hiccup ends up flying the dragon and keeping him as his own sort of pet. His Father sets off in search of the nest and leaves Hiccup in dragon fighting training but Hiccup has managed to see a softer side of the dragons and instead of slaying them he uses his training methods to calm them. When his Father returns he is furious at Hiccup's betrayal and he captures his dragon which he has named Toothless and again he sets sail intent on destroying the nest with the aid of Toothless' directions. The story is like no other that DreamWorks has created and the film is not a comic film. There are a few moments of comedy but the story is more about the connection seen between the boy and the dragon. It is all so sweet. The dragon is like an over-sized dog who obeys his master's command. The boy forms a trust between the dragons and even has them shuffling up alongside him wanting to be stroked like a cat or dog would do. The movie has heart and doesn't rely on laughs to see it home.  The voice cast are good and most of them go unnoticed in their roles, which is good as the last thing you want is to think of the actor rather than the character. Baruchel's voice is very distinct but it works with the weak and feeble Hiccup and of course you can tell it is Butler as the Father as his voice works so well with the large, broad stereotypical man he is playing but I had no idea the likes of Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill or David Tennant were in the film until the credits rolled, which is what I want from an animated film. Adults will love this film just as much as children and if anything I think it is a more adult film that children can love as opposed to the other way round. With few moments of childish comedy and a lot of character connection the film can be related to adults with the childish elements being put in with the colourful dragon's, the slightly clich\u00e9d final act and the fact that it is a cartoon. This makes the film loved by everyone but in a different way that people loved Shrek or Toy Story. I loved this film and hope that adults aren't put off watching it due to the animation as it was one of the sweetest, heart moving films I have seen. The cast are great, the animation's great, the characters are great and the dragons are so unique. The ending is also sad and not a stupid clich\u00e9. The film was near perfect and the reasons it isn't are these two lines: 'we live in an old town' \u2013 but all the houses are new and 'it snows nine months a year and hails the other three' \u2013 spoken when they are flying on their dragons in complete sunshine with no snow or hail in sight. Having said that I am not going to let two petty things spoil an otherwise brilliant movie. See it whenever you can.", "Introduction This paper is going to be about the film How To Train Your Dragon which is part of DreamWorks Animation. This film is set in the days of Vikings and their village is attacked by dragons that feed off of their livestock and set portions of the village on fire. The villagers do not like the dragons; they want to destroy them. Hiccup, played by Jay Baruchel, wants to be like his father Stoick the Vast, played by Gerard Butler, who slays dragons. Stoick decides to let Hiccup join the others Astrid played by America Ferrera, Snotlout played by Jonah Hill, Gobber played by Craig Ferguson, Ruffnut played by Kristen Wiig, and Tuffnut played by TJ Miller, who are all learning about the different types of dragons and how to slay them. Plot and Theme As Hiccup learns about the different types of dragons he is secretly seeing the \"night fury\" that he named Toothless because it appears that the dragon does not have any teeth, but he does they are retractable. As he gets to know Toothless, Hiccup realizes that the dragon can't fly due to an injured tail; Hiccup invents an attachment that will help Toothless fly. The scene when Hiccup and Toothless go for a flight it gives the sense of excitement because he has became friends with the dragon and as the soar through the sky and in-between the rocks that protrude through the waters the viewer can not help but feel how happy Hiccup and Toothless are about this accomplishment. Since Hiccup has been seeing Toothless he has learned techniques on how to train different types of dragons from being with Toothless and this is helping him through the training that he is doing with the others, but Hiccup does not want to harm the dragons he simply wants to train them. Astrid finds out about Hiccups secret about Toothless and learns that the dragons can be friendly. Snotlout, Gobber, Ruffnut, and Tuffnut find out about the dragons as well and they along with Astrid and Hiccup train several other dragons to help defeat the main dragon. The villagers are afraid of the dragons and assume that the dragons want to destroy their village. Stoick decides that him and other dragon slayers should find out where the main nest of dragons is and slay them to protect their village. Once the main dragon leaves the nest Hiccup and his friends, along with their dragons, defeat the dragon and protect Stoick and the others. Everyone learned that the dragons are friendly and can be used to benefit them. Also, Stoick and Hiccup learn to accept one another for who they really are. Conclusion Throughout the movie the use of lighting was done to help capture shadows and natural light for example, this helped show the definition of Toothless' scales on his skin. Also, the use of angle was used demonstrated as Hiccup and Toothless fly through the sky to help viewers feel as if they was flying along with them. This movie was very well put together and the actors done an amazing job for the characters; they gave them great personalities. The plot and theme go hand in hand as they tell a story about a boy, Hiccup, coming of age and wanting to be like his father, Stock, only to realize he is his own person and to accept himself as such and so will his father; and also learns that he has his own talents that eventually benefit the entire village by training the dragons. This film can be related to the film Tangled; this film is about a girl Rapunzel, played by Mandy Moore, who is coming of age and wants to leave the tower that her abductor has kept her in and has raised Rapunzel as her own. Rapunzel does leave the tower on an adventure to see the floating lanterns and eventually finds out she is the lost princess and goes back to her original home. Both films are animated and tell amazing stories about coming of age with fun adventure and colorful scenery that are fun for the entire family. Reference Arnold, B.

Hiccup, played by Jay Baruchel, is a young boy wishing to join his father, Stoick, played by Gerard Butler, and the other men on the island of Berk as a dragon slayer. However, Stoick does not believe his son can be of any assistance because of his small size. What Hiccup lacks in size, he well makes up for in brains, inventing a tool that shoots down the mysterious Night Fury dragon that all the people in the village fear. Instead of killing the wounded dragon, Hiccup befriends him. Hiccup eventually learns the truth of why the dragons attack the village. This story is a coming-of-age story about a boy wanting to be like his father, but in his own way. The story triumphs when the father and son learn to respect the differences they have and even learn from each other. The ending of the movie is similar to the ending in the movie Pinocchio. In both movies, the young boy saves the day and earns his father's respect. Much of the movie is about how Hiccup and the dragon, named Toothless learn to trust one another. When Hiccup sees that Toothless cannot fly because of his injury when Hiccup shot him, Hiccup uses his inventive skills to fashion a new tail-piece for Toothless that allows Toothless to fly. The scene where Toothless takes a long flight with Hiccup is especially exciting. The fast pace speed of flight through the rock formations in the water will have viewers holding their breath until they are back in open air space. There is the additional subplot of romance intertwined throughout the movie. Hiccup has a crush on a young dragon slayer named Astrid, played by America Ferrera. At first, she has no interest in Hiccup, but when she learns about Toothless, she becomes an ally for Hiccup. The movie makes good use of color throughout the movie from the black color of Toothless, the mysterious Night Fury dragon, symbolizing it is something feared. The difference in the colors of the village homes and landscaping at the very end tells how life has changed for the villagers. How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent coming-of-age movie for the entire family to enjoy. Let the family laugh and cry together through the watching of this animated movie.", "\"How To Train Your Dragon\"? Really? Come on! You can sense my skepticism about this feature by simply mentioning its title. It sounds quite ridiculous, yet it fits perfectly. The story is simple. With a Viking setting, a boy who wants to be a warrior befriends an injured dragon and develops an unlikely friendship with it. The plot does not provide anything new, yet the animators do a swell job of making the audience fall in love with dragons. The combination of character's facial expressions and animation makes this feature among the best I have seen. The voice talent is exquisite, especially Jay Baruchel as the lead protagonist. What adds another flavor to this animated feature is John Powell's score. I knew it was not going to win at the Oscars, yet I was hoping it would. I have listened to all of the scores nominated at the 2011 Oscars and this was easily the best. Though a seemingly a simple tune, the music erupts into a fantastic orchestra, which takes the story to a whole new level; like what John Williams did for \"Star Wars\". When watching this on a DVD player, I just had to crank up the volume as I found myself conducting to the musical composition. Sorry for sounding absurd, but John Powell has created a gem that cannot be topped and it has truly touched the essence of my heart.  My rating: 3.5 out of 4 If you have not seen this animated feature, you are really missing out.", "This movie blew me away. Everything about this movie is perfect. The action sequences (sorry, didn't see it in 3-D so I can't comment on that), the story, special effects and the acting all come together to make one truly goosebump-worthy film. The movie follows Hiccup, a young Viking who lives in a village where they are almost constantly attacked by (yeah, it's pretty obvious) DRAGONS!! But the plot twist comes when Hiccup befriends one and goes against his village's beliefs, thus embarking on the adventure of a lifetime! The acting in this film is excellent. Jay Baruchel makes a really likable Hiccup, and Gerard Butler as his father is also very awesome. All the laughs, tears and excitement are delivered flawlessly by the amazing cast. The special effects really are something (especially on Blu-ray, which is the format I watched it in for the 1st time). The color palette is really diverse and the colors come alive on the screen and, of course, whenever a dragon breaths fire, it looks really jaw-dropping :P Although, what's the best thing about this movie is the ability it has to make you cry. It has some really tear-jerking scenes that you certainly want to watch out for. The message about things not always being what they seem is delivered in excellent form, and truly makes this film great. The music is also good and is what makes the goose-bumps happen during the action scenes (while the amazingly well-written script delivers them in dramatic ones). Bravo, Dreamworks! You have managed to make a kids movie which is also great for adults!! Well, I could ramble all day about how this film is great, but really, with an amazing script, acting and special effects, I really don't know what you are doing here reading this instead of watching this really excellent and breathtaking movie ;)", "It's always satisfying to find such quality in kid's films. This was very much the case with How to Train Your Dragon. Dreamworks has really triumphed this time, making a highly creative and brilliantly original film that is surely the greatest thing Dreamworks Animation has released since Shrek. The film is set in a fantasy land where vikings rule the land and dragons rule the skies. Every night the dragons come and attack the viking town, creating a regular routine of epic nightly dragon battles. The protagonist of the film is the meek little wannabe dragon slayer, Hiccup. Hiccup longs to be a viking champion but doesn't exactly have the physique or stamina to do so. But what he does have is a heart, and so when he finds an injured dragon in the woods he slowly grows a connection to the dragon, realizing that his viking brethren have been going about the man versus dragon conflict all wrong this entire time. The film is a breathtaking fantastical adventure full of action, suspense, and plenty of laughs. The concept of this film is something I am honestly jealous that I didn't think of it first. The idea of vikings battling a diverse race of dragons that come in all shapes and sizes is so brilliant to me, especially when presented in the way How to Train Your Dragon pulls it off. This is a story that reaches its full potential as we are constantly delivered uncanny doses of dragon action. And even the \"dragons are actually our friends\" message the film possesses doesn't come off as cheesy and it doesn't give the film a labored \"just for kids\" feel. It is still a lot of fun and it satisfies any desire you might have ever had for a vikings versus dragon film, which you might not realize you had until you watch this film. Granted, there are those things that remind you this is a kids film like the obvious subplots, the kiddy jokes, and the ending that wraps everything up a little too perfectly. But it's all kept to a minimum so as not to impede on everything else great about this film. But what is even more wondrous and ecstatic is the beautiful artistic quality of the film. The look of the film is glorious and even overwhelming in its epic scale beauty, and the film's direction captures this so eloquently. An animated film gives a director so much more freedom in direction as there are places you can get a camera in an animated film that you never could in real life. The directors of How to Train Your Dragon know this and they utilize this rare freedom all too well, especially in the scenes that take place in the air as dragons swoop gracefully through the sky and zip around at magnificent speeds. Yet, not only is the film beautiful, it's also awesome. And I mean that with the utmost sincerity. There are truly wicked moments of the film that blew me away. They aren't things that are just cool for a kids film, they are downright badass. I'm mostly talking here about the dragons themselves. The creature design work on the dragons is truly amazing. This film takes the dragon mythology and pumps it full of steroids and makes it something so much bigger and better than we could have ever imagined. There are numerous types of dragons which all have their own traits and abilities, as is often detailed by the character Fishlegs, voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who talks about every dragon as if it is a World of Warcraft villain. But the amount of thought that went into the dragons of this film and how their individuality would be utilized is incredibly well done. I would love to see a sequel to this film that takes the dragon concepts even further, despite the fact that I was not let down in the slightest by the amount of dragons in this film. There were so many moments that I forgot I was even watching a kids film and I thought I was watching a serious fantasy art flick. It was absolutely astounding. I couldn't have been much more happy with this film. It is almost too cool for words. It is a kids film at heart and it has those little things that remind us of this fact, but overall the film is brilliant. It's visuals are astounding and the entire concept behind its story I found to be pure genius that I want to see taken even further in the future. I really do hope that this marks the beginning of a new franchise for Dreamworks Animation. I only hope that they can keep up the quality longer than they did with the Shrek franchise. But for now, all I can say is that they are off to an incredible start.", "When How to Train Your Dragon was released into cinemas it's first weekends box-office was disappointing, but thanks to positive reviews and good word of month it had staying power and was a very successful film for Dreamworks. On the island of Berk the Viking population have a dragon pest problem with the reptiles stealing their livestock. On resident on the island is Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a disrespected blacksmith who has an reputation for being a clut and he sets out to prove himself by killing the most dangerous dragon breed of all, the Night Fury. He is able to bring one down with his inventions but when he finds it he is unable to kill it. His father and the chief of the village Stoick the Vast (Gerald Butler) goes on a mission to find the dragons' island to stop them once and all and gets his friend Gobber the Belch (Craig Ferguson) to train Hiccup with the other teens on the island for Dragon Hunting training. But Hiccup finds the Night Fury on the island, befriends him and studies the creature, using what he learns to ease through training. But most of all, with his new friend Toothless discovers that dragons are not monsters at all. What makes How to Train Your Dragon work is that Dreamworks follows Pixar's model of story and character and not go for an overload of pop-cultural references. This is the story of an outsider who wants to prove themselves to his community and ends up learning and using his knowledge, a good message for children. It is also a story of friendship and we get to believe that Hiccup is a gently soul who wants to help the creature. There is also the old chestnut of a child wanting to prove himself to his father and a father not understanding why their child is so different to what they were. The directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois are both famous for directing Lilo and Snitch and both are from the Disney school of how to make animated movies. But after leaving Disney under bad circumstances they have found a good way to get back at their former employers by making a hit film for one of their rivals. Both men are able to mix action, comedy and tender moments, starting with the village getting attacked. The humour is a healthy balance of child friendly slapstick to witty lines and jokes. The action is well done, from when Toothless is flying, the dragon attack and the dragon hunting training. The animation is top notch, whether it is the details on Toothless or of the world and the well made action sequences. Hiccup is a great voiceless character and the animators did a great job to allow him to express himself, either through his eyes or ear movements. The writers and directors made him out to be a cross between a dog, a cat and a horse in the way he acts. He would be a great pet. Gerald Butcher was pretty much playing King Leondias from 300 and that is why I liked his character, a gruff, tough war leader who is so macho that he can't express his emotions. My one major problem is Baruchel because I do find his voice slightly annoying, playing his character as a stereotypical whiny nerd. He becomes better later on but I found it hard to warm to him straight away. Overall How to Train Your Dragon is a fun fast paced film for children and adults of all ages.", "In this day and age when quality animated features are the rule rather than the exception, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" still manages to beat all comers with its charm, imagination and honest sentiment. Based on the story by Cressida Cowell, the movie focuses on Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Jay Baruchel), the scrawny young son of a Viking leader (Gerard Butler) who worries that his boy may not possess the mettle a true Viking warrior must have to smite the many dragons that periodically swoop in on the village to steal its food. It's not that Hiccup doesn't WANT to be a dragon-slayer; heck, he's even enrolled in a dragon-slaying course replete with real dragons for the students to practice their moves on. No, the problem is that Hiccup has met and made friends with an injured dragon in the wild (a beast he calls Toothless) and the lad soon discovers that dragons are not the natural-born enemies to Man that he and the other Vikings thought they were. Beyond its glorious visuals, eye-popping action sequences, and terrific voice-over work, \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" written and directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, emerges as a surprisingly compelling human tale of a boy who wants desperately to live up to the high standards his demanding father has set for him, but who just can't betray his new-found best friend in order to do so. Without getting sappy about it, the movie provides fine moral lessons for the youngsters - though, one should point out that the intensity of the action scenes may prove a tad disturbing for the very littlest in the audience. Its soaring flight scenes are some of the best we've ever encountered in an animated movie, and its canny combination of humor, adventure and sentiment catapult it to the head of the class among recent animated films (along with \"Toy Story 3,\" that is).", "Coming out of the box of Dreamworks the movie have so many expectations. Do it stand on it? Hell yeah! After a long time this one delivers a great concept molded perfectly into a movie. Moreover its original, its refreshing and its gonna take you to a new world, a world of Dragons. Visually the movie is very appealing with all the effects and flawless animation can be seen throughout. The characters are appealing as I said the concept itself is quite good. The direction is perfectly worth appreciating. The protagonists character ie Hiccup is carved out so magnificently. One more thing to add is that the movie stirs you up emotionally as well. The bond of Hiccup and the dragon toothless is elegantly portrayed. The movie is predictable and that's the only minus point. Overall I can definitely say that it's not just meant for kids, the elder are gonna enjoy it as much. Two thumbs up for the great job, I loved it.", "In the beginning, Dreamworks Animation had excellent 2-D films such as The Prince of Egypt and Road to El Dorado. I thoroughly enjoyed these films, and they were just as good as what Disney was putting out at the time. These films, while they had good comedic scenes, seemed to have a more serious overall tone to them, and they packed a good emotional punch. Then came 2001, with the release of Shrek. Everything changed for Dreamworks at this point: mostly CG animation, broader comedy, a greater focus on celebrity voices and topical humor. Shrek itself, and its first sequel, were very funny and enjoyable uses of this formula. However, Dreamworks soon pigeonholed itself into that sort of movie, becoming known as second-rate to Pixar in the process. Then came How to Train Your Dragon. This movie is about Hiccup, the son of a Viking leader whose village slays the dragons that steal their food. Hiccup longs to be seen as a man, but he has not shown the skills or strength that a dragon-slayer normally would. One day, he does manage to catch a dragon, whom he eventually names Toothless. Toothless proceeds to change his life, and the life of Hiccup's village, in the process. How to Train Your Dragon felt like a return to the Dreamworks movies from the '90s/early '00s. There were certainly comedic scenes, but the story was focused on the relationships between the characters in a very meaningful way. Through the course of the movie, we see how Hiccup's relationships with Toothless, with his father, and with the other youths in his village grow and develop. Seeing how these characters relate to each other gives this film a certain power that has been missing from many of the more recent Dreamworks films, and it was so much the better for that. In addition to the story, the visuals in this film were remarkable. A good deal of attention was paid to the details in each character, especially in the different types of dragons that were created for the film. And the scenes in which the characters flew were absolutely breathtaking. It helps that I saw this film on a big screen outdoors; the visual and aural spectacle is certainly compounded in that format. If you, too, have felt burned by Dreamworks Animation in recent years, don't hesitate to come see How to Train Your Dragon. It is absolutely a pleasant surprise.", "Directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois put their spin on a popular children's book by Cressida Cowell. This vivid animated feature takes place on the Island of Berk, where Hiccup(voiced by Jay Baruchel) the son of a Viking chief finally gets his chance to enter dragon fighting school. The hapless lad appears to be least likely to succeed. He is smitten with the only girl in the school, Astrid(voiced by America Ferrera). Capturing and slaying a dragon will mark his passage into manhood and prove his worth to the whole tribe on Berk. Plus it probably will impress Astrid, not exactly a fair maiden. Hiccup unexpectedly strikes up a friendship with a young dragon, when he enables the crippled creature to fly. The young viking will become a celebrity when he secretly learns how to defeat various dragons without harming them. Cinematography is outstanding and the screenplay is a pleasant escape and fit for all ages. Other character voices: Gerald Butler, Craig Ferguson, Kristen Wiig, Ashley Jensen, Robert Atkin Downes and Jonah Hill.", "Dreamworks animation has pretty much always been a poor man's animation studio when compared to Pixar. Sort of, the Kmart version of Pixar. They made movies that were just supposed to be fun, but not really have much in terms of story or characters. The Shrek movies, Madagascar movies, Over the Hedge. I don't their movies, I actually like quite a few of them, but none of them really impressed me. Until this movie. The plot isn't original, anyone who critiques this movie will tell you that and milk it for all it's worth. The plot is the same as E.T. and Lilo and Stitch. But you know what, I don't care. The characters are what make this movie more interesting. I love the relationship between Hiccup and his dad despite how clich\u00e9 it is. Hiccup kind of reminds me of myself. And Toothless, well, kind of looks like a mix between a bat and a cat, and is one of the cutest things I've ever seen in my life. The animation is absolutely amazing, the colors and detail show that they really cared about this movie. The action is also good, man do I wish I saw this movie in 3D. And it's just funny. While How to train Your Dragon may be a little bit clich\u00e9 in it's story departement, it's also really fun, has some great characters, great animation, and clever humor. As far as I'm concerned, this is Dreamworks Animation's masterpiece.", "Spoilers: I think that This movie was one Of the best I have seen in a long time! My mom got upset after Toothless was shot out of the sky, but towards the end she admitted she liked it. I just can't seem to figure out what to call the Giganto dragon at the end. I've heard the Mother Dragon, The Green death, and the Red death. It's blue, for heaven's sake! I'll just call it Big Momma. I CAN'T imagine what the second movie could be about, unless they started to FINALLY follow the book storyline and we get pirates. The thing that ticked me off was that Hiccup lost his foot. Oh well. Other than that everything was fantastic! A++++++++++++++++++!", "When I first saw commercials for this movie over a year ago, I thought it was going to be horrible! The commercials showed stupid jokes and dumb gags, and bad acting. Now I know that one of the only bad things about this movie was the marketing! The movie begins with a large group of dragons conducting a large raid at night on the small viking village named Berk. Our protagonist, Hiccup, a young viking teenager,explains via voice-over that the vikings have been at war with dragons for centuries. It is also shown, after Hiccup is shoved in doors, that he is physically weak. He wants to shoot kill a dragon to prove that he has worth and to get a date. Unfortunately, his only hope of this because of his weakness are these inventions that only he is nerdy enough to build. After using one of his inventions to shoot down a night fury, the scariest, most deadly species of dragon of them all, no one in the village believes him, as he's lied about killing one before. After this Hiccup decides to go hunting for the dragon himself. I won't say much more for fear of spoilers and that this part of the review is getting really long. First of all, the first 3/4 of the movie is hilarious. The jokes aren't gross or dumb, nearly all of the laughs come from witty dialogue. This means its just as funny for adults, teens, and preteens as kids.  There are some really thrilling sequences in this movie, particularly the opening and climax. It had much more action than I expected. It was really cool! There was a little bad voice acting, but for the most part it was really good. Especially from the voice actors/actresses who play Hiccup, his father Stoick, and his crush Astrid (actually a girl, though it does sound a little like a boy's name). The script was really good to. You really got attached to the two leads and actually care, unlike most other Dreamworks movies. It's surprisingly dark, too, though not to dark, but still darker than most animated movies. All in all, this movie was amazing! Worth a buy or at least a rent, so go watch it! You won't be disappointed! All in all", "I had heard a lot about this film before seeing it; after all, it was a huge hit when it hit the screens last year. Now showing on TV, I thought it was about time I saw just what all the fuss was about. You'll be pleased to know I wasn't too disappointed, I really enjoyed this tale of Vikings, Dragons and friendship. There were just a couple of niggles, but I'll get to them later. When young Hiccup, son of the town of Berk's leader, Stoick the Vast, decides he wants to fight dragons, he disobeys his father and goes into battle with an invention of his. He brings down a rare dragon, a Night Fury, but finds himself unable to kill it when he finds it the following day. He releases it, but it is injured and needs Hiccup's help to be able to fly again. He calls the dragon Toothless and it's not long before they become friends. Through Toothless, Hiccup learns more about the dragons that have been plaguing his town and that it is not through their own choice. When Stoick discovers the dragon you can tell there's going to be conflict, but will it end well for the boy and his dragon? Well, you've probably guessed I'm not going to tell you here. This film has two things in its favour, a decent plot and some top class animation. It's all beautifully drawn in a similar style to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009), which I also enjoyed very much. Well voiced by the talents of; Jay Baruchel as Hiccup, Gerard Butler as Stoick, Craig Ferguson as Gobber the Belch, America Ferrera as Astrid, Jonah Hill as Snotlout and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs\u0085 to name but a few. I said at the beginning I had a couple of niggles, well, we'll start with accents. I was always brought up to believe Vikings came from Scandinavia (that's Sweden, Finland, Norway or Denmark). These appear to all come from Scotland for some reason. Also, despite the fact that all their parents speak with Scottish accents, all the kids speak with American accents (very confusing). Furthermore, on a technical note, although I saw it in 2D, the picture seemed very dark, even the outside scenes looked a bit muted. Probably an after-effect of it having been 3D'd for those that like parting with the extra cash. It may have got a higher score were it not for the niggles I've mentioned here. Over all though, it's the story that's important, and this film really delivers on that count. The animation is beautifully done, when it's not too dark to see and the characters are well thought out, despite their unusual choices of accents. I really enjoyed it!\u0085 Highly recommended. My Score: 8.4/10", "I gave this a ten because everything was just done well (Or well done at times too)I only seen this on HBO so I didn't get the full theater and 3D effect, but even so it was a fun movie for the whole family. There's an underline message about perceptions and prejudicial attitudes, but it's not something in your face.  The other thing that makes this so enjoyable is the animation itself. The animators have come a long way in really making the human subjects movements and actions seem really human. Even facial expressions is right on. On top of that they managed to get some good acting voices and everything just pulls together well. It's really just what it's supposed to be...Just a lot of fun....", "This film has been out for some time.. by some time i mean, i have only just watched it and i'm jumping on the 'This is a great film' train a little too late! I love animated films and as an aspiring animator myself it's great when you're left with a gob-smacked look on your face after watching it. I'm not a fan of Dreamworks what with the killing of Shrek, Madagascar and hopefully not Kung Fu Panda but they did good, real good. I have just read that they're making a second film to this one, i hope they don't destroy a good thing, i heard that even if a film makes $1 then they'll go ahead and make another, makes sense really but think about those who watch it and pay good money to see it.. learn from Pixar, how to make a proper sequel and how not to destroy a good thing! This film is great, easily appeals to both adults & children and there's a nice little message for parents in there's as well. The best thing about the film was Toothless, the main Dragon.. i actually want one. The one thing that does annoy me is that obviously we don't know how Dragon's behave but i doubt it's exactly like a Dog, all films do that.. kind of annoying.. what's funny is the only film i can think of about a Dog is Bolt and that was nothing like one, strange. Worth a watch, i'd buy this if i had the money.. after a few other films easily inc. Toy Story Trilogy, which says a lot but they're on to a good thing just don't ruin it.. learn from Toy Story!!!", "I have seen this movie several times now lost count of it. Keeps getting better each time. It is among the best movies ever made. Classic example of how you can inspire through animation. The movie is a mixed bag of humor, drama, emotions, love, care, egos and finally victory. I cannot find a flaw in the movie. The effects are spectacular, the dialogues are very well-written, the cinematography is spectacular. I am sure that if this movie had been 2 1/2 hours instead of 1 1/2, we would still enjoy it and wouldn't feel the time pass. It is very rare that an animation movie keeps you at the edge of your seat and wanting for more. Great movie all round! Suitable not just for kids, but for every person in the family. It's worth buying a DVD for personal use.!", "Dragons. They're the mythical creatures prevalent in one form or another in almost every culture. Dragons have also been a cinematic mainstay, starring in films such as Dragonheart, Dragonslayer, Reign of Fire and animated films such as Shrek and the classic Pete's Dragon. Now, Dreamworks, also responsible for the Shrek franchise, have breathed life, just as dragons breathe fire, into a popular children's' book. It is during the time of the Vikings, and they have made a living out of killing dragons that terrorize their village. The story focuses on Hiccup (Baruchel), a teenage misfit who prefers to use brains over brawn and doesn't seem to be going down the traditional dragon-slayer route, much to the chagrin of his father, the chief Stoick the Vast (Butler). Using an invention of his, Hiccup manages to down a Night Fury, a very rare breed of dragon. However, he cannot bring himself to kill it, and subsequently befriends and tames the dragon, which he names \"Toothless\" for its retractable teeth. Through his interactions with Toothless, Hiccup becomes a kind of \"dragon whisperer\", bewildering his classmates in dragon training, and inciting the jealousy of Astrid (Ferrera), an \"action girl\" Viking whom Hiccup nurses an unrequited crush on. It is not long before Hiccup's double life is unveiled, and he has to convince the Vikings, most of all his father, that the dragons are not the vicious beasts that they are made out to be. First of all, How to Train Your Dragon looks stunning. Beautiful animation brings a stylized Viking village to life, and every detail, from Stoick's impressive beard to the scales on the dragons, is vividly realized. Toothless is given very expressive, liquid eyes that dilate and contract, and convey so much emotion. The film is also very kinetic and boasts beautiful camera-work that makes it feel more like a live-action film, and the action scenes are great as well. The 3D technology is used to its full potential here, giving depth to the already-lovely landscapes and fleshing out the characters. It also pulls the audience into the action scenes, especially sequences of the dragons in flight. Most of all, it makes the characters, be it human or dragon, that much more real and relatable, which is the greatest way that 3D technology can be used. But visual spectacle is nothing if there's no story to back it up. Thankfully, there's a good one here, a simple but effectively-told tale about the bond between man and animal. It's also a coming-of-age story that every teenager who has felt awkward or outcast (make that all of us) can relate to. Hiccup's relationship with Toothless almost recalls classic boy-and-animal films such as the Lassie movies, Black Beauty and the Flipper and Free Willy films. It goes without saying that Toothless is a most adorable creature, comparable almost to Pixar's lovable robot WALL-E, and probably the cutest dragon one ever will see. The voice acting, while perhaps not a highlight of the film, is undeniably good. Dreamworks is notorious for capitalizing on star power, with actors such as Eddie Murphy, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Will Smith having provided the voices for their past films. Here, Gerard \"King Leonidas\" Butler is perfectly cast, his gruff Scottish accent giving a sternness to the tough Viking chief. Butler is also able to express the frustration many parents feel at their children who seem to march to a different beat than they did. Jay Baruchel inflects his delivery with wit and a certain dorky charm, which suits Hiccup to a T. Ugly Betty star America Ferrera is also good at the \"tough gal\" shtick, and actually sounds believable as a teenager. John Powell, who has previously scored the Jason Bourne movies, X-Men and Mr. & Mrs Smith, among others, provides an excellent soundtrack for this animated adventure. The music during the action scenes is rousing and kinetic and conveys a Viking toughness, but there are also romantic and subtle moments in the score, particularly during Astrid and Hiccup's shared flight. In the end, How to Train Your Dragon is a bit of surprise, considering this is the studio that always plays second fiddle to Pixar animation, and has produced roundly mediocre films such as Shark Tale and Madagascar, that rode primarily on pop-culture in jokes and not much else (surprisingly, and to its benefit, How to Train Your Dragon has nary a pop-culture reference). Sure, this is probably no Ratatouille or Finding Nemo, but it is Dreamworks' best effort yet, and comes darned close.", "Wow. I never thought there would be a movie that equals the quality of Pixar. This movie is truly a challenge for those great Pixar movies. Dreamworks finest animation movie. Way better than Shrek. The best movie they made. When people animations they mostly make it with lots of comedy with a drama thrown in here and there. The proportion between comedy and drama is a feat achieved by none other than Pixar until now. Yes, I can honestly say that this movie is Dreamworks masterpiece. I would place this movie under the category of adventure/drama rather comedy/drama. From the beginning to the end the movie keeps you hooked up with fantastic landscapes filled with rich beautiful colors and top-notch animation. I can clearly see with how much passion was this movie crafted with. Likable and enjoyable characters. Simple yet top-notch dialogs. Revised concept yet, unique and refreshing in its own way. Even those simple scenes like eye-contact engulf you with emotion. And, of course there is one huge plus for the movie. The background musical score. John Powell is the man. His musical scored is layered and blended beautifully and succeed in bringing out the emotions even more. Also, the music sticks to your heart for days. Just like Pixar Dreamworks had finally made a film worthy of Oscar. I just hope just like the evolution of Pixar in making better and better movies, Dreamwork with start making better and better movies.  A high praise for the animators who have done an excellent job on animating the dragons through a mixture of emotions and expressions and for the characters as well. A rounding applause for the voice casting. I don't care about the Scottish and English accent. They did a wonderful job in bringing characters to life. A true masterpiece done with such artistry and passion. I hope this movie get at least one Oscar. Boy, I wish I had a dragon to ride.", "i just loved this film and I think it is the best animated movie ever i mean it beats everything else: finding nemo toy story (entire series) shrek (entire series) cars and many more of these Disney films I hope this film gets an award and if they are making a how to train your dragon 2 then i can't wait The effects in 3d were epic and although i thought there was only going to be a few special 3d effects i was wrong because when you were least expecting it  bang 3d effect i just loved that I could also see that my kids really enjoyed it as they didn't even try to make an excuse to stop watching it this an amazing film you have to watch it by my opinion if you don't i guess that is your loss", "That's what I have to say for the filmmakers. \"How To Train Your Dragon\" harmonically deals with many of the current social issues, such as xenophobia, ethnocentrism, racism and homophobia. It's interesting to see that Hollywood here is not only trying to provide entertainment and money for themselves, but also trying to give some good messages for the kids who are the future of this world. Despite some slow scenes in the beginning, this film was quite entertaining and I bet kids would be amazed with the dragon stuff. I'm about to recommend it to all my cousins' children who are thirsty for animation films and some time to spend with their friends.", "It started out blaring action and it wasn't really exciting action either.You didn't really have any feel to the movie and almost seemed dull.I thought it would be just another okay Dreamworks film.Sadly, thats how half of their films are.Then,after the first ten minutes Hiccup meets Toothless and they instantly have a tight bond and it's touching,like a bond for a dog or a cat.I would have thought they would make the dragons talk and was dreading to see if i was right.They didn't though and thats what made the movie outstanding.It slowly grew the bond between them, while all the other characters are very likable too.The dragons were very interesting to look at and it was cool seeing all the many different shapes and sizes of them.The humor is funny but it doesn't focus on that as much, which i liked(Hiccup still has a burst-out loud monotone humor,though).The score is beautiful,the animation is very advanced,and it's most importantly amusing and touching (get past the very beginning). Is there anything bad about it? Not much. It is nothing like the book to all you fans of the book(i actually wonder if they read it),but i liked it a lot more.It has a better plot anyway.Did i like it more than the movie about toys that beat it at the Oscars? I would have to say no,but it is VERY close. I recommend it. 8/10", "I have seen this movie around 10 times; on DVD and movie theatre. The plot is great. It made me want to know what goes on even though the story theme is not original. The characters are amazing and lovable. There is somewhat a clever sense of humor. However, the thing that gives this movie a 10/10 and not an 8 or a nine is its amazing soundtrack. John Powell is my favorite composer just because of a few of the songs: Test Drive, Forbidden Friendship, Coming Back Around,Romantic Flight and many more. I loved them so much that i got the music sheets for some of them and am learning to play them on the piano. Hopefully, you guys will enjoy it as much as i did.", "It's a huge pity that I didn't watch this cute animated film on 3D, otherwise there would be a big possibility that I will give it a 9/10. After many years of the predominance by Disney- Pixar, this time Dreamworks strikes back to overthrow its throne, however, as I haven't seen TOY STORY 3 (2010) yet (It might be hard to believe, I haven't watched any of TOY STORY franchise), I cannot judge if HTTYD could win the BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM over from TS3 in the coming Oscar, yet I will feel very much pleased if it happens.  Without a raft of vulgar jokes, the film takes a firm stand to satisfy both children and adult demography with a meaningful storyline and some eye-dropping special effects. The designs of different kinds of adorable dragons can easily catch kids' heart, and the clever move of nerd-become-hero plot is ace in the hole to attract older youngsters, moreover, the excellent mouth-to-mouth reputation does surely allure a much wider audience range.  The score is another great achievement, perfectly connects with the whole film and add more relish to it, which has earned the film another nomination this year. As for the cast, Jay Baruchel sounds much better in a cartoon than any other films he has made, Gerard Butler's strange accent makes up for his slightly boring character as our protagonist's Viking father.  If I must pick some bones, I would say as much fun as I am getting from the film, the secondary characters fail to shine, all other kids didn't endow me with any vivid impressions even though they are voice-casted by Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.  The film set another criterion to the up-coming animated features from all Hollywood film studios, I just pray that imagination will never die.", "I always enjoy good animation movies (like Up, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille etc), and this movies certainly belongs to that category. Dreamworks animation is just superb but it's the story that attracts the most. It's about a boy, named hiccup, in a vikings country which is constantly under attack from various fierce dragons. Hiccup struggles to be in the league of his father, who is vikings' leader in their war agaisnt dragon, and other warrior vikings. Out of desperation Hiccup ended up shooting one of the deadliest dragons and then finds that beast only to realise he could not kill it. On the contrary he tries to bond with it and the story unfolds itself . It's a simple story, with a son trying to impress his father and also his fellow people and a girl too. But the cute dragon and the way this simple story is shown makes this an extra-ordinary watch. :)", "I probably should have watched How to Train Your Dragon in 3D. As it was, on my hi-def 2D television, the effects were a real joy anyway. And, as it was, it turns out that the movie is a heck of a lot better than your average blockbuster kidflick \u2013 Pixar notwithstanding \u2013 that's terrific fun. The aptly named hero of the story, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Viking. Seriously, try to imagine Jay Baruchel as a Viking warrior, and you can't. He's basically the runt of the litter, and he's always kept indoors when his remote Scandinavian village is attacked by flying dragons. Hiccup is small but not without some courage; he often sneaks outside just long enough to cause trouble for the humans. And so it goes. One night he accidentally wounds a Night Fury, the kind of dragon that's so stealthy it's practically invisible, the kind that spits lasers out of its mouth instead of regular fire. The kind, in other words, that ends battles quickly. Hiccup, after some awkward moments, befriends the young dragon but keeps its existence a secret from the town, knowing they'd just as soon put it out of their misery. Meanwhile, young Hiccup is being trained to be a Viking along with the other of-age kids (including America Ferrara, Jonah Hill, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse), because all the manly men are out looking for the dragons' hive. Hiccup learns he has an ability to empathize with the airborne reptiles, which enables him to defeat them during his training, thus making him the toast of the town. And then, of course, his dad (Gerard Butler) returns and thinks his formerly nebbish son is now the one who will save them all. At its core, this is a movie about acceptance. The humans must accept that the dragons have a perfectly good reason for raiding them; the dragons must accept that the humans aren't so terrible after all; and Hiccup's dad must accept that his son will never be seven feet tall, weigh 400 pounds, and be able to wield several double axes at once. Everyone has his part in society, and papa Stoick comes to realize that mindless violence might not be the ultimate answer. (It's a kids' movie, after all.) The story is wonderfully told, but even better is the terrific animation, on par with \u2013 dare I bring them up again \u2013 Pixar. The movie is, naturally, up for Best Animated Feature this year, and it deserves to be. The voice roles are well cast, for the most part (it's easy to accept Butler as a Viking, but Baruchel's nasal whine gets a little tiresome). The action scenes are a pleasure to watch, rivaling (and even copying) Avatar, and the attention to detail looks impeccable. Interestingly enough, the end scene isn't quite what you expect. It's not a bad thing, and it's certainly not implausible. In fact, it's a heck of a lot more believable than what you'd get out of a typical animated movie. That unpredictability sort of buttresses the charming characterizations by Butler and (yes) Baruchel as father and son and earns this movie high marks.", "First, something I've said in the past. It's the script, stupid. This script is brilliant in such a way that most of the reviewers here utterly miss it. Let me explain. You have a complicated fantasy world, with its own spin on Vikings and all different kinds of dragons. Each kind of dragon has important strengths and weaknesses that are at times critical to the story. The movie almost seamlessly gives you a lecture in Dragons 101 and the life of these Vikings, without being irritating or boring. If you cannot understand the dragon side of the movie, you never should have watched it because you were determined to be bored anyway. Plus the initial voice-over explaining all of this ties into action, and visuals, that both kick-start the narrative in high gear and mixes it with action sequences that both show what's being explained, and keep it fascinating and funny. I wish my workplace training videos had 1/10th the effort put into them. The story is fairly basic, but it's been claimed there are only seven main plots in literature (depending on whom you read, of course). The fun is how you get there. Yes, you have the outsider kid who is not interested in what all the other kids are into. He makes good, and becomes the hero. There's a girl involved too but anything else would be a plot spoiler - however, since you see her in her armor with skull decorations (small) in her first scene, I can safely reveal that she's definitely no shrinking violet. There is the plot line of maybe looking at why the other side is doing what it is doing, and the main character's (named Hiccup) questioning that is what provides for the story and much of the conflict. Contrary to some other people's spin on it, there is a truly evil nemesis, and no amount of understanding is going to change this bad guy. Understanding gains allies who had been adversaries, and the chance to win the final conflict. But final conflict there is, and boy it's a doozy. I wish I'd seen it in 3-D. We saw it at home on blu-ray, and the video quality and sound-track are superb. My seven year old daughter has declared it her favorite movie, and both my wife and I, who often take 20 minutes to agree on a movie, both love it and will watch it again. Instead of trying to be pseudo-realistic the animation revels in being just that, and the movie is the better for it. I am happy I do not have to vote on best Animated Film this year. The three nominees we've caught, Toy Story 3, Tangled, and How to Train Your Dragon are all so different, and so well done, that I would have trouble choosing, Luckily, I can watch all three on Blu-ray.", "How to Train Your Dragon may seem like a movie geared toward a younger audience, but personally I loved it. It certainly brings out your inner child and sparks your imagine. It has a great voice-over cast including Jay Baruchel (from She's Out of My League) as Hiccup,Gerard Butler, and even Christopher Mintz-Plasse who played McLovin from Superbad.  Hiccup is a teenage kid living in a viking society. Most of the vikings are all strong and muscled up, even the women, and their main job is to fight off the dragons that steal their cattle in the night. Of course, Hiccup is the outcast of the teenage bunch. Being kind of puny and weak, he doesn't get to fight the dragons and just gets in the way. Eventually Hiccup brings down one of the most feared dragons and finds out their really just a misunderstood species. He makes the dragon his pet and then the two have to save the village. If I had to compare it to another movie I would have to say Shrek. Hiccup is like Shrek in a certain way because at first he is nobody then helps save the day in the end. People see him differently and he finds his place in society. Both movies teach the viewer to embrace the differences in people and you really can do anything you set your mind to.", "I wasn't sure what to expect and went in to see the film expecting it to be a nice pleasant animation. How wrong I was. This is a brilliantly crafted script, where the animation is just incredible. I hate the over use of superlatives. But the detail, the entertainment value are amazing. It takes a bold stance attempting to entertain adults not by being cute, gimmicky, thematically challenging or infused with pop culture shout outs. It does so by being imaginative, heartfelt, and beautiful in fiery flourishes. When it comes to the use of 3D it is everything that Avatar was except this doesn't bore you to death with a flimsy story and pure emphasis on the WOW isn't 3D amazing. You do not need to see this film in 3D to be blown away - it's a great story, well crafted and very well made. A don't miss as far as I'm concerned.", "This movie was totally awesome. Highly recommended for ANY AGE. I am 23 years old. And this movie rocked. I would watch this with my younger cousin, my brother, sister, parents, friends, roommate, girlfriend, or grandmother. It is truly an example of how movie progress is being made in the creative and highly entertaining world of what originates as children cinema and ultimately transcends the industry as a classic for all ages and for people from all slices of life. This movie has it all: action, drama, comedy, adventure, romance, and good old fashioned innocence. It is highly imaginative - i only wish i read the book. An upstairs neighbor recommended this movie as a medium between the high octane action-adventure-thriller movies i enjoy and the chick-flicky make-you-cry thoughtful films that my girlfriend enjoys. It was all that and more. ...maybe still more my speed. Definitely worth checking out - on big screen, rental, redbox, or borrow.", "How to train your dragon was seriously one awesome movie. I got the pleasure to see this movie in a very extra special day for me, and I really did not found interest, thought it was a little kids movie. I was very very wrong. This film had great 3D effects, that no other animated movie can create. The plot is about Hickup, a boy who wants to fit in an slay a dragon. However as the story goes on he gets to realize that they are not as bad as people think think. First of all his character is hilarious. Next, Toothless, the main dragon of the film is very adorable. Not only was he named incorrectly, but you get to make a bond with him. The other characters I really had no interest for since they were really not the people I would want to have around me. The movie has a very strong message about don't judge someone by their appearance. That message really won over me. This movie is awesome and it was one of the best animated. However the only problem is that when I rented it, I didn't like it as much as before. But, over that little thing, the movie is a really god, and a must buy.", "This is possibly one of my favourite films of the year. Very enjoyable, very funny, very dramatic, visually stunning and breathtaking. The films pace is perfect, you feel like it ended exactly when it needed to. The animation is amazing. Several subtle characteristics come out from the animation That impresses me all the time. I have watched it at least once a week since released on blu ray. I could try to give you a detailed break down into what is good about this film but I decided to just let you watch it and then you will know. If you haven't seen it already then where have you been?! Don't take my 9 stars lightly, this is better than megamind by far. Much more complete as a film. Now bring out the 3D version and stop hogging it SAMSUNG!", "Within minutes I was drawn into this movie. It feels like you're really there in this amazing world of dragons and vikings. Other people may consider this a childish movie, which it sort of is, but it also contains many subliminal lessons towards friendship, understanding and living with nature, family etc. But I think the best thing about this movie was that it was really fun. All the dragons are portrayed in quite a hilarious manner and the main dragon character, Toothless, was so playful and cute, I couldn't help but smile when watching him and Hiccup bond. As violent as the concept of vikings and dragons fighting and killing each other may be, this movie does a great job of covering it all up and transforming this into a truly heart-warming experience.", "FANTASTIC 10 OUT OF 10 THIS MOVIE REALLY HAD ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT AND IT WAS GREAT THE QUALITY OF THE ANIMATION REALLY BRINGS IT TO LIFE SUPPORT THE CREATORS AND GREAT JOB ! this is similar to Shrek animation style and its a cool and more modern style of art in theaters we would enjoy more of the genre words cant go far enough alone to describe the power behind these animations keep the goodwork up the story is a unique one with a lot of hit and misses the story takes awhile to pickup in the beginning then really sores during the middle and end with high volume action and story line there were times it seemed the characters would be attacked they were given a lot of fights to bring out what they were fighting for.", "REVIEW: This entry into 3D cinema is a wonderful adventure which has both elements of a traditional fairy tale and of a modern teen nerd story. It tells a updated version of befriending dragons, similar to The Neverending Story and Dragonheart. The animation is Dreamworks' best and sets very high standards with its complexities with dragon flight, fire-breathing, and nature (clouds, water, etc). My friends and I found it uplifting, funny and off-beat, not unlike Shrek. The voices especially those of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, and Christopher Mintz- Plasse were terrific. Hiccup and Fishlegs are refreshing, unheroic nerds much like Po in Kung Fu Panda. I heard the reviews which were generally very good but this movie exceeded my expectations in the first ten minutes with its dramatic opener. Aside from that, the soaring flight into the sky with Hiccup and Astrid was animation at its most majestic. The relationship between Hiccup and his father Stoick was the most endearing family relationship I've seen portrayed in animation. The lines for Hiccup, Fishlegs, and most of the other Viking teens was colorful, sarcastic and insightful. The lighting, color and cinematography push the boundaries and are unmatched in animation. If any shortcoming this film has, I thought initially the dragons should have been bigger and more scary, but that would have defeated the plot. Some people criticized the dragons but when you realize what the filmmakers were attempting, it made perfect sense. In fact, the variety of dragons was very creative as we are introduced to many of them. Toothless, although plain-looking was made to resemble a big black cat or panther. The idea of dragons as pests to dragons as pets defined the roles of dragons in this movie.  CRITICS?  Most interesting was Roger Ebert's criticism of the film. I don't think he actually watched it since quite a few of his comments were factually incorrect. For example, suggesting Hiccup used a cannon, that the adult Vikings rode the dragons or there was a final battle scene between good and tons of bad dragons. Those things never happened...uh, Roger. In addition, some people wrote in on IMDb. First, there's comparison with Pixar which many believe sets the standards. Second, there's complaints that the story is unoriginal and too familiar. I would challenge both. First, if you check the success of both companies, Pixar has 9 movies grossing over $400 million worldwide and Dreamworks has 8 movies grossing over $400 million. Second, the average Pixar rates slightly higher but I feel some of Pixar films are slightly overrated in particular Wally-E or The Incredibles (I know, sacrilegious to some). (On the other hand, I think Ratatouille is far superior to Wally-E or The Incredibles.) Some people find HHTYD theme of a son trying to please or fulfill his father's expectations as too familiar and unoriginal...but really, can you name a film that has the same theme? The most common movie plots and genres are: action thrillers, sexy murders, horror, superheros (why the Incredibles is less original), romantic comedies, fairy tale endings, sci-fi thrillers, vampire movies (as of late), westerns, musicals, sports movies, period romances and period actions (e.g., Gladiator)...well, I made my point. I think people think this theme has been often done, but it is only our own story at home (we all have families, right?) that makes it familiar. Besides considering films like The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast...are those great animated films original? Clearly Dragons is refreshing and more original. THE BEST ANIMATED FILMS  Dragon ranks as Dreamworks best along with Shrek. Right behind are Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Kung Fu Panda. It's in the class with Pixar's Up, Toy Story 3 and maybe Ratatouille. They rank along with the more classic greats as Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King or Snow White...or less traditional animated films like Spirited Away, The Iron Giant, or South Park. In short, How To Train Your Dragon ranks as one of the top 10-15 animated films of all-time.", "Meet Hickup, a hapless young viking ( voiced by Jay Baruchel) he lives in an isolated village where the pests happen to be dragons! Hickup is not a strong and tough young viking. No he's more of a thinker albeit a fairly clumsy one! His father is the village chief and he's not particularly proud of his hapless son who is not the strong and fiery son he imagined he'd have! One day he manages to shoot down a dragon though. But there are no witnesses so nobody believes him. The next morning Hickup finds the dragon. He wants to kill him but he can't. He decides to help the dragon who cannot fly properly anymore because of Hickup. A difficult but in the end touching friendship develops. With a great story and fantastic animation, characters which are easy to relate to and a good portion of humor, this is certainly one of the most rewarding animation movies I watched in recent years. Highly recommended, though not for small kids!", "Okay, let's get it over with: That arena is the Thunderdome, the water landscape is from \"The Incredibles,\" the monster dragon at the end first came to eat Andromeda in \"Clash of The Titans,\" and Toothless is (Lilo and) Stitch in black leather, right down to the funny flat feet and claws (DON't TELL Disney!!). Just for starters. Let's call them \"tributes,\" to avoid a trademark fight. But if a film geek like me can watch this thing through once, again with the commentary, and then the ending again just because I didn't want to lose the evening's groove, then you need to get the DVD, too. No, it's not the 3-D version. It's the version you can stop and reverse to re-hear some very fun dialog. So I can't resist any film with bagpipes and ancestral Scots accents and hints of the folk tune \"Barbara Allen,\" and editors smart enough to know when to turn the !#$!! music track off. Dare you to watch this and not want one of those dragons, with their beautiful fish/bird/dinosaur anatomies and moves, for your very own. Catch Pete Postelwaithe's face as the model for the Dad's. We might watch it again tonight, too....", "Dreamworks has a lot to compete with. I mean against Pixar. Only one Dreamworks film has won an Oscar, and that was Shrek. Pixar has always done masterpieces while Dreamworks(except for Shrek, love that movie) has only done good movies. A dreamworks film that really impressed me was How to train your dragon, a colorful, original film. Hiccup(voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a wimpy kid who lives in a town where vikings have to slay dragons. And dragons are hated. Hiccups dad(voiced by Gerard Butler) wants Hiccup to be a viking, so Hiccup is put in training. Hiccup soon forms a friendship with a dragon he calls \"Toothless\". And he keeps it a secret to avoid trouble. While training, people realize that he has a way with the dragons. And he meets a girl. I can't spoil anything else for you. How to train your dragon is your typical \"Boy and animal friendship\" story disguised as a fantasy. But this one is really enjoyable. The visuals, unlike most Dreamworks animated films, are nicer to look at. This is also more adventurous than any others. The film is funny too. And it's very entertaining. Is it better than Shrek? Um, not quite. Shrek is a work of art. I think it's the best Dreamworks animated film since Flushed away. Though it doesn't live up to Toy story 3(which everyone loved), it is still a very enjoyable animated film. I surprisingly liked this movie a lot. A-", "Watching \"How to Train Your Dragon\" on DVD, I had my first (and what could well be my last) case of 3-D regret. Watching the young viking Hiccup soaring on the back of his new pal Toothless the dragon made me seriously wish I'd seen the film in theaters and yes, in 3D, a medium that I've stood soundly against with exception of \"Avatar.\" Its absence, however, is evident in DreamWorks' breathtaking \"Avatar\"-similar story of dragons and vikings misunderstanding each other. Much like \"Avatar,\" \"Dragon\" tells a classic story of rivals only between man and beast in this case, which hearkens to our mistreatment of animals, but that's a lesson for another day. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a sarcastic young viking who wants to be \"cool\" and demonstrate the strong and fearless viking traits, but he's scrawny and as a result isn't anything like his his dad, tribe leader Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). When Hiccup captures the most elusive of all dragon breeds, he thinks his days as a loser viking are over, but when he finds his prey, he can't bring himself to slay the beast and ends up befriending it instead. \"Dragon\" highlights how the misunderstood protagonist tends to be the most effective in animated/family films. As a \"black sheep,\" we sympathize with the character and over the course of the film that grows to empathy, which strengthens when the character has a reversal of fortune. In this case, Hiccup's friendship with his dragon-friend Toothless, leads him to learn things about dragons that can tame them and uses these techniques during dragon training to appear to have outsmarted the beasts. Then comes the accidental event that causes Stoick to more or less disown his son and after that, you're fully invested in the story. The humor in \"Dragon\" is much more minimal than say, \"Kung Fu Panda\" and certainly \"Shrek,\" but what it lacks in laughs it makes up for in truthful storytelling, terrific visuals and overall cuteness. Among writers/directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders' best decisions ranks the one to make the dragons a lot like dogs in their expressions and behavior (when they're not shooting flames at people). Toothless' concept design gives him the versatility of scary and super friendly and ultimately we learn to like him quickly. Conventions in storytelling only go so far, but when they're adorned in great visuals and given a unique context such as the viking world (as historically awkward as that is if you know anything about vikings), they seem fresh and more importantly, serve as effective entertainment. Although the heart of the story will be gone for the upcoming sequel just on the basis of how the movie ends, this creative team will no doubt find a way to get the job done. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com", "This is weird to say in a review but I watched this movie with the worst mood and the most pessimistic assumption of a movie in a long time. Man, was I wrong. First off the whole character development actually made me watch the movie without looking how many minutes are left of the movie. I just watched it the whole way through and before I knew it I liked something. The 3-d animation was cartoony, but at some places I was at awe at some of the 3-d textures they put into this movie. The overall in general concept was very clich\u00e9 but how the concept was portrayed and the act in which they specifically tackled it, made it fresh and unique. If you are slightly or even considering watching this movie. I would say go ahead and watch it. The only way I can see how someone wouldn't like this is if they aren't into these movies or they have a grudge of some kind towards the making of it. Enjoy. 8/10", "What a great film. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and the kids in the audience had a lot of fun as well. The film is endearing, with great dialogue and fun and moving moments. Lots of jokes, both for the kids and for the adults, and lots of action and excitement. Overall, a \"must have\" in any parents' DVD collections. The only flaw with this film, the only reason I'm giving this a 9 instead of a 10, is the inconsistency in design. The main dragon character (\"Toothless\") is so wonderfully drawn, so sleek and mysterious, so emotive and beautiful, but most of the other dragons are goofy, pudgy, misshapen, and ludicrous. I guess it's in-line with the original kid's book on which it's based, but I found it distracting. If all the dragons were as beautifully and carefully designed as Toothless, the look of the film would be infinitely better. 9 out of 10.", "There are lots of common elements of a good story here, a sweet but smallish boy who wants to be more like his larger than life dad, other kids not respecting him, finding a lost and injured creature, the two of them bond and help out the rest. We have seen it with lost horses, lost dogs, just about any kind of animal. But a dragon??  That basic storyline is applied here to a fantasy world in an undefined time. The village has been there for a very long time, but all the buildings are new. We are puzzled by this brain teaser but soon realize why. The area is populated by a variety of dragons, which periodically raid their town, carry away animals, and burn the buildings with the fire from their mouths. So the main occupation in this town is dragon fighters. And builders. There the dragon fighters look like Vikings, and sail, but they speak like Scots. Gerard Butler is the leader of the dragon fighters, as Stoick. His teenage son is Jay Baruchel (bah-roo-shell) as the small and weak Hiccup. Fellow Scot Craig Ferguson is his right hand man, Gobber. And America Ferrera is the cute girl, Astrid, who wants to be a dragon fighter also. This is a highly entertaining, animated fantasy movie. SPOILERS: There is a particular kind of dragon that is a deadly shot, but comes only at night and no one has seen one. But Hiccup designs a kind of catapult, and he shoots one down. Finding it the next day, it is injured, missing part of its tail guidance system and can't fly right. It is a beautiful dragon, sleek and black, much like a stealth fighter. Hiccup becomes friends with it, brings it fish for food, and fabricates a replacement part for its tail, which Hiccup has to control himself, thus he flies it. He goes back to the village and becomes the one who learns how to train dragons, and in the end they become useful friends in the village, after the super giant dragon hiding in the mountain is destroyed and the other dragons no longer needed to raid food to feed the giant dragon.", "It's always nice to see a non-Pixar movie being able to convey emotions not only to children, but also to the adults that accompany them. And while I'm sure you won't be able to tame a dragon after you watch this (first you have to find one of course), it is a very fine movie, that has just a few minor flaws. And even those will not really be seen by most people (as flaws), because they might just not care. It's a movie that is about peace of course, but there still is a big danger. And of course quite a few things might be a bit too simple. Now again, if it weren't for Pixar, I might not even notice or care about those things. But there is Pixar and to make a perfect animated picture has become really hard. Still very good (hence the rating), so more than worth a look! (Great voice cast)", "Yep - and I mean that from the bottom of my heart! Remember the faces of those hobbit-kids at the beginning from Lord of the Rings 1 when they're listening to Bilbo's story? I'm sure I've looked quite similar while I was watching this lovely fairytale 'How to Train your Dragon' unfold. Absolutely wonderful work, people from Dreamworks & Cressida Cowell - thank you very, very much! The story starts right in the middle of a dragon-attack of a small Viking-village. Since generations the villagers and the dragons appear to be each others favourite enemies, but via Hiccup it turns out that this dragon-terror of stealing sheep happens for a more banal reason: the dragons themselves are dominated by an \u00fcber-dragon (I guess the burning the houses-part is just a form of stress-release-for-dragons). Ergo: the status quo of things is going to change, for both the villagers as for the dragons. And who's changing things? The \u00fcber- Viking's son Hickup. Hiccup is not your average looser - Hiccup is different (and thank god for him that the other members of the tribe don't consider that to be a threat) - just different ....", "Oh this was surprisingly more enjoyable than I expected, especially since I had to either watch it in 3D or not at all. But at least the movie's landscapes scenes looked really good in 3D - I saw in the credits later that Roger Deakins, the cinematographer for No Country for Old Men and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (ain't that a mouthful), amongst others, was the visual consultant.  The main story itself was trite, but then it's based on a children's novel, and most of those are structured rather the same way. The characters were fortunately quite endearing, and the dragons were cute and looked unique. More importantly, there was good flow to the movie - I don't recall being bored at any time - and the action sequences were spectacular. I can't say for sure if I should credit it to the 3D or the directors but watching the characters zoom around on their dragons was quite thrilling. I'd probably give this movie credit for being the second movie that makes good use of 3D (the first being Avatar of course).", "Boy wants to go off and fight dragons but he generally causes more harm then good with his inventions. He randomly fires off one and the next day finds he's downed a dragon. While his dad and the other vikings head off to kill the dragons the boy and the dragon he caught bond opening the way for human dragon friendship. Why don't I like this better? Its got great characters, great writing, great sequences, wonderful animation....and yet it just missed for me. Was it the fact that the plot is too waiver thin that you can mostly fill in the blanks? Maybe partly, but then again it constantly surprises you. Was it the wildly uneven character design that runs from realistic to Looney Tunes? Maybe. I knew the silly faces were coming from the trailers but when you finally see them its kind of a let down. Mostly I think its the pacing which is a bit lax, thanks in part to too many beautiful flying sequences. The flying stuff is great, but there is almost too much of it. And several other sequences seem to go on too long. The sequences, say the training sequences, are great but they go on and on. Its a solid movie, but where the whole thing should have been great to match the bits, the whole is just good. I will give the film points for being ballsy enough to have the finale cost our characters something.", "This is one of the best animated films of the year. It's great to see in 3D as well. With amazing visual sequences and funny humour, How to Train Your Dragon delivers them wonderfully. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a boy who wants to be a viking, like his dad (Gerard 'THIS IS SPARTA!' Butler). But when he finally captures a dragon who he calls Toothless, he soon realizes that they might not be so bad as they think. This is a great film with wonderful visual sequences and great characters. Astrid in particular became my favourite by the end of the film. In conclusion, I recommend this film, especially in 3D. Wonderfully made.", "This is a wonderful move if you are a kid or have kids. The 3D animation is well done. The flying scenes are spectacular and reminiscent of Avatar, although the 3D technology in this movie was better. I found the story predictable (boy sees girl, saves everyone with the help of an unlikely foe, gets girl) and the whiny main character annoying. The whiny voice makes it difficult to relate to Hiccup and his youthful angst confuses rather than creating sympathy. It pales in comparison to great animated features like Mulan.  Overall, it was an enjoyable, but definitely not a 'must-see' movie unless you're a kid. Kids will enjoy the level of excitement and everyone likes funny-looking dragons.", "I have seen most of the Pixar/CGI-style family movies that have been considered \"very good\" by popular opinion and I must say that \"How to Train You Dragon\" may very well be one of the best. Whether you are male or female, young or old, I believe that this picture will appeal to you. The action is very solid throughout the movie. The outline of the film is described early on and everything flows at a wonderful pace through the duration of the film. The plot is also one of the best things about this movie. I really like the idea of a nobody telling all of the big shots that they \"have it all wrong\". Hiccup's character progression is done superbly throughout the story. He changes immensely, but it all makes a lot of sense. This movie does not lack action in it's conclusion either. The final battle against the massive queen is reminiscent to a final battle in a video game. She is so big and powerful that she seems unstoppable.  If you are privileged enough to see this in 3D, you will be treated to some great 3D action. I've seen four or five movies in 3D now, including Avatar, and without doubt, this takes advantage of the new 3D technology over anything else that I have seen. This movie has heart, compassion, intelligence, action, humor, and a terrific plot. One of the best animated family movies I've seen in quite some time.", "Went to see this with my kids, 8, 6 and 4. They loved the superb animation, the great variety of colourful dragons and the breathtaking flying sequences and all the fireballs, but they only understood the story at its simplest level - i.e. a rather sweet story about a sensitive teenage boy called Hiccup, a weak, \"underdog\" Viking, who befriends a dragon against the wishes of his father. This film must come with two warnings (1) It is far below Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and other \"classic\" Dreamworks output. (2) Apart from the names of a few of the main characters, Hiccup's underdog rise, and the mythical location of the Viking island of Berk, the film bears little resemblance to the series of 8 brilliant Cressida Cowell books (which I highly recommend for readers aged 8-12). There is an attempt at humour, but it is quite weak, mainly because the supporting characters are all incredibly flat (and its a double shame because the Cressida Cowell books are hilarious). Hiccup, his father Stoick and the dragon, Toothless, are well portrayed, though. Also missing is the sort of modern pop soundtrack and pace that made Shrek stand out. Indeed, the film has a very slow start, largely because there are just too many device seeds to sow in order to make the all-action climax work. Although the climax is a brilliant visual spectacle, it all feels rather forced - the feeling I got was that they went through so much trouble to set up the climax, but it still didn't make sense. And to top it all Hiccup has an unnecessary love interest, Astrid. She is great as a Viking girl character, but there was no need to force the romance between her and Hiccup - it added nothing to the story except for schmaltz - something we'd expect from Disney rather than Dreamworks. Overall, this has to be one of the weakest scripts Dreamworks has produced. It will keep the kids entertained for a couple of hours and its probably even worth getting on DVD, but its most definitely not a classic. As a post script to the review, I'd also like to rant about all of the voice talents as well. Why does Hollywood think its okay to give Scottish accents to the adult Vikings? Do they not know that there is a difference between Vikings and Scots? And why, having given the adults Scottish accents, do they think that its okay for the teenagers (Hiccup, Astrid, etc) to have American accents? And if they're going to have American accents, why not have them voiced by teenagers, rather than by adults. Hiccup in particular I thought sounded far too much like the adult American that voiced him, nothing at all like a teenager, let alone a Viking one.", "How to Train Your Dragon ranks with the best features that Dreamworks has produced. Not since Shrek has there been such a wonderful collision of fantasy, wonderment, excitement, and humor. The setting is fun and somewhat unique; Vikings populate a barren island, their only enemies being the dragons that occasionally attack to steal their sheep and destroy their homes. In the midst of the excitement a young boy must come to terms with not being a typical Viking. He is small and puny, and not the great warrior that his dad had hoped he would be. He has other talents, though, that he explores as the film progresses. Along the way he discovers that not everything is as it seems, and even dragons mustn't be judged by their fiery covers. The film looks fantastic, with wonderful settings and vivid characters. The dragons are alternately fearsome and adorable, depending on the mood. The relationships among the Vikings are generally honest and convincing. How to Train Your Dragon is also quite hilarious, with abundant sight gags and humor both adult and childish. As a whole, the film succeeds admirably and is well worth enjoying with the entire family. -Tim, a Heartland Truly Moving Pictures Jury Member", "I was appalled by the unspoken message of this movie: If we just show kindness and understanding for our enemies, they will stop attacking us and become our friends. In fairy tales that kind of namby-pamby wishful thinking works, but in real life it's likely to get you killed. Unfortunately, impressionable children will be viewing this movie and internalizing this dangerously naive message. Some would say that the world would be a better place if we would all just stop fighting and show understanding for one another. Yes, it would. However, I'm pretty sure that terrorists and tyrants aren't going to be as cooperative as the fictional characters in this movie. My grandchildren enjoyed the movie, but I'm very sorry I took them to see it.", "Let's get the positive out first, for a first. I LOVED the graphics in How to Train Your Dragon. In a lot of ways, even though it was animated, it was thoroughly more believable than the similar Avatar. Yep, I said positive, as in singular, not that the movie was bad, or was dragon (ha, uh, never mind) but the story was so incredibly basic, clich\u00e9d, predictable and overdone that even though it might have had \"heart\" at its core, I was so overwhelmed with the same'ole'same'old'stuff that I couldn't get into the characters. It probably doesn't help that I CANNOT STAND Jay Baruchel. Even his voice. And he's the main character, Hiccup. I've been told this is geared towards kids. Yeah, blah, blah, I know, but in the age of Pixar, or heck, the last of the great Disney Dynasty films: The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin or The Lion King, there is NO excuse for not having a great, even mesmerizing script. And because of the weak screenplay, it shares more qualities with Avatar than just dragons(-like creatures.) Like I reported: the graphics were amazing and brought you into their fantasy world. But so did Wall-E, and tell me which one was better when it came to having both cool effects in conjunction with a great story? Anyhoo\u0085Hiccup is the weakest link in the village'o'vikings who battle dragons on a daily basis and being the son of the leader of the pack, Stoick (Butler) he has to prove himself. But, surprise, he can't when he does land one of the rarest of dragon breeds. Another surprise \u2013 if the title doesn't give it away \u2013 is that he both befriends and aids the recovery of the dragon when his tail was cut. Further surprise occurs when he learns they're not the threat his town folk fear and he becomes affectionate with Toothless, the dragon. I'm having trouble coming up with more words that would precede \"surprise\" so let's sum up the rest: a girl he likes becomes suspicious, he must lie to protect both himself and his \"pet/friend\" and the finale's seen a mile away if you already knew the above after pretty much just the first surprise/spoiler's revealed. I will say, the one \"twist\" they put on this century's old plot, was the dragon's motivations. I admit I liked that, but it wasn't enough to mask the other 95 minutes of predictability. The REAL story here, and why I am recommending this, is the cinematography. The movie's beautiful and extremely well crafted. I've suggested leave-your-brain-at-the-door movies before, so I will here because otherwise you'll miss out on the beauty of this film. That said, I won't be rushing to see the inevitable sequel, but I'm glad I experienced this cinematic experience.", "Before entering the movie theater I had no idea of whom the cast of How to Train your Dragon would be so I was playing Russian Roulette with it. After watching it I realized that I fell asleep halfway through the movie due to the lack of excitement and knowing I had spent about 80 dollars for 4 people wasn't to pleasing on the ride back home. I thought I would enjoy a nice 3d flick with my family, but instead I saw a so-so animated flick with so-so actors. I also thought that they could have put more detail into this movie. Compared to the last few 3D movies we've seen, such as Alice In Wonderland and Avatar. This movie is under par with them. So if you want to see an animated movie on 3d I suggest waiting for Toy Story 3 because this is the last time I'm going to be seeing a Dream works made film in 3d.", "I would have given it higher reviews if it had not been called this and the characters have not been called what they were. I don't even think you guys read the books. I do think the actors did a good job, but the books were nothing like this. The dragons weren't hunted, they were befriended by the young viking BOYS. There weren't any girl vikings, they were in a different tribe. Toothless was small and green and the most \"common common or garden dragon\" and everybody teased him for being small and skinny. Oh, and Fishlegs was skinny and squinted and had asthma. Snotlout, unfortunately, was the one everybody liked. Oh, and Astrid didn't exist. I hope for the second movie, you actually glance at the book.", "I liked How to Train Your Dragon, but not as much as everyone else seemed to. Maybe it was just talked up too much. The animation is unique and the characters are interesting, but the story felt flat and I found myself checking the clock at times. This movie entertained me, but not as much as I thought it would.", "Definitely one of the best cartoons i've ever seen. I haven't been this surprised since The Lion King. Within year's, as i grew up, i have definitely lost an interest for the cartoons. My interest was won back again with Wall-E but since this years or should i say last years, at my opinion highly overrated UP, i lost it again. Than a week or two earlier, i took my young cousin to see How To Train Your Dragon. I was quite skeptical about it. I thought it will be very boring and completely childish. And it is childish. But still, there is something about it that makes it more than just watchable for the adult's, too. I really, really liked. The story is beautiful but simple. The voice over's are great and the Dragon's are characterized brilliantly. All in all, this is a brilliant cartoon that i'm definitely gonna see again, with or without my cousin! I recommend it to everybody. And literally everybody!!!", "\"How to train your Dragon\" is perhaps the best wholesome entertainer of the year so far or may be only entertainer which is worth your ticket money. The story is about the humaneness of Hicupp, his injured dragon and how they both help in changing the attitude of Vikings that Dragons are bad. The movie will hold you and keep on edge of the seat from begin to end. Apart from story, the visual effects of fires are simply amazing. The growing friendship between the cute dragon and Hiccupp is something really interesting and unpredictable. The ending climax is also something different, I mean, Hicupp's state after waking up from sleep. The colors and actions of different types of dragon has been wonderfully depicted. All in all, an out and out pure entertainer for whole family.", "Just watched this 3-D computer animated movie with my movie theatre friend who had seen this a couple of times before. It's an awesome tale of a young man named Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel) wanting to become a real Viking like his dad, Stoick (Gerald Butler). But one thing he doesn't want to do is kill dragons especially when he befriends one he names Toothless...While there's some witty lines and some humorous visuals, this was a mainly compellingly stirring adventure tale about standing up for your principals despite the prevailing mood of the crowd. I'll leave it at that and just mention the other voices that were heard here: America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig, and, the only one I actually recognized while watching, Craig Ferguson. All of those and others contributed wonderful performances. Special thanks to the writer/directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders for the entire thing, which should come as no surprise since they also did the equally entertaining Lilo and Stitch at Disney back almost 10 years ago. So on that note, I highly recommend How to Train Your Dragon.", "Before watching the show. I had no expectations of it being a good film. My wife told me about How to Train Your Dragon was receiving good recommendations from her co workers, so we decided to see it. After watching the movie, I have to say this is not a good movie, but a great movie to watch for all age groups. Highly recommended and here are my reasons: 1. Excellent character development and story from the get go. The movie makes you care about what happens to the characters as the movie plays out. 2. The 3D effects are used to support the movie scenes by adding details and background environmental effects. The 3D effects are not the star of the show. 3. I have seen the following movies in 3D: Monsters vs Aliens, Avatar, and Up. This one beats them easily in turns of pacing, dialog, story, and entertainment value. 4. 1/4 of the audience were composed of kids in my watching of the show. I definitely heard a few kids calling out the characters' names during the tense times of the movie. As an adult, the movie makes you feel what it is like to be a kid again. Pure fun for the whole family. 5. Vikings and Dragons. If any of these subjects appeal to you then it is a must see movie. 6. Its worth the full price of admission to see How to Train Your Dragon. Best time we had at movies in over a year. 7. Only minor negative comment is the movie is 98 minutes long (kind of short). But since my eyes were glued to the screen, the movie feels like a 2+ hour movie (which is a good thing for me or I feel ripped off).", "How To Train Your Dragon is the incredibly told story of Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), a boy who lives in a world of vikings even though he himself does not want to be a viking. He one day finds a dragon named Toothless and realizes that dragons have been falsely accused of being monsters. The film's visuals begin to pick up from then on. The dragons are beautifully drawn, the characters are beautifully drawn, and the land is even beautifully drawn. The director's atmospheric film making adds to the fun as the director paints an accurate picture of what Hiccup's world would look like. Also, when it comes to voice acting, this is the film to go to. Baruchel's nasally, wimpy voice adds to his character. This can also be said about the voices of TJ Miller, Kristen Wiig, Gerald Butler, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, America Ferrera, and Craig Ferguson. For anyone searching for a good time, How To Train Your Dragon is for you. Also, for anyone looking for the reason of why we go to the movies, this film is also for you. This is the perfect film for parents to take their kids to, because both the parents and kids alike will thoroughly enjoy the film, like I did.", "I loved the movie, especially the fact that dragons had felines traits, that were captured with an intricate detail that only a cat lover able to do, and I bet all cat lovers appreciated tremendously. Expressive but not-overbearing 3d effects and all visuals were executed with an artistic taste and with a good heart. Jay Baruchel was easily recognizable in Hiccup, (great work - animators!) naturally likable character in his honesty in admitting his imperfections that later turned to be to his advantage. All characters were distinct and engaging, I could recognize modern teenagers in them. Moreover, the film carries many positive messages that our society needs. Being intelligent is better than being a fighter, parents sometimes can be wrong, try to find peaceful solution to the conflict. The story won't let anyone predict what is going to happen. I believe I truly felt the same that the characters felt at some point - had no idea what's gonna happen next, and I usually can predict storyline turns in movies.", "Now, before we begin on this review. I'd first off like to say that 99% percent of the time I would pick a Disney/pixar Movie over a Dreamworks flick. This is not the case this movie is a great film, I've seen so many films over the last few years that pride themselves on the fact that there visually stunning. What makes this one so different you might ask yourself. It's the fact that it doesn't pride itself on that. Of course It's a good looking film (hense the 3D effect) but it's the story that really kept me going for 90 or so odd minutes of the picture. I saw this movie with my girlfriend (15) my mom (56) and my nephew(8) and we all loved this movie. I think that this easily is the best Dreamworks movie since the original Shrek. It also has humour and great chemistry between these characters. If your looking to see a good movie this weekend or on cheap night go out and see this and I can assure you that you won't be disappointed I was hesitating at first but now I'm glad I did not wait until DVD release or Illegal download for this flick. It's a masterpiece best movie I've seen since Avatar. (9/10)", "I don't know. I saw only one trailer of the film before watching it. Maybe it was the low expectations. Well, given Dreamworks' stream of recent animated films (\"Shrek\", \"Madagascar\", but leave out \"Kung Fu Panda\" which was genuinely great) one could expect laughs but little substance. I am glad that my low expectations were blown away immensely. Not only is \"How To Train Your Dragon\" hilarious, it is also genuinely heartwarming, filled with gorgeous and beautiful animation, and topped off with easy-to-like characters (and dragons, to boot), and a very positive moral core to it. Yes, it has it's fair share of clich\u00e9s and obtaining a somewhat predictable story, but it's mainly a family film, so they are excused. Yet, with all this in mind, I felt something when watching the movie. I don't know what it was, but it was the same feeling I felt when watching most Pixar films like last year's \"Up\" and especially \"WALL-E\". It was a wonderful feeling.  I genuinely felt for the characters, they were very easy to like and to relate to. It was to my surprise that I knew almost all of the actors who starred in it but did not recognize them at certain parts. All of the voice actors are great, especially the lead Jay Baruchel. I also absolutely LOVED the main dragon Toothless even though it wasn't a talking animal, with it's realistic and humane emotions and its beautiful design. The animation was also beautifully rendered, and it is truly a sight to behold in 3D, with some scenes comparable to the 'Ikran' scenes from Avatar, if not better. It took me away from the real world and into the film's fantasy world. The film's moral message, that we should not judge things by its cover and thus act rashly towards it, is straightforwardly delivered. And finally John Powell's music score is sweeping and full of emotion in many moments. Therefore, \"How To Train Your Dragon\" will definitely get my approval for one of 2010's very best films, if not THE best so far. Let's hope not. However I have the urge to see the movie again as it felt like it was infinitely re-watchable. Parents should take their kids, children should see it with their friends, couples should see it together, everyone should see it. It is one of the best animated films to come out in a long time. And it definitely blows away all of Dreamworks' previous effort. Bravo, Mr. DeBlois and Mr. Sanders. Congratulations for making another animated classic. Overall value: 9/10.", "A good break from the usual talking animal meets human, the choice of the non- talking dragons added a sense of realism and a natural appeal to pathos. I think most people in the theater wanted to adopt one of the dragons! Next, I thought the music was very good, and some of John Powell's best work. While putting in some ethnic inspired themes, he added his own amazing flair into the score that truly brought this film to the next level. Gave me goosebumps from the opening scene! Finally, I thought that the animation was outstanding and very well done; plus the addition of 3-D really brought out the effects of this film that rival the 3-D work in Avatar and Alice in Wonderland! All in all, a very good piece of work worthy of an Oscar!", "incredible! certainly the front runner for the best animated film of the year. from the first to the last frame this film is as good as an animated film gets on almost every level. beautifully written, designed and executed. though an incredible movie, it's not quite perfection - probably due to time and budget limitations (is there ever enough of either?). that said, the problems i had are far too few to mention. if dragon doesn't absolutely slay at the box office i'll lose faith in middle America. congrats to the filmmakers - you've made a masterpiece and you made me feel like a kid again. thank you.A grate expense see in IMAX", "I saw the movie in 3D last weekend, and after that I know that it's another DreamWorks animated classic. The film is based on the book by Cressida Cowell. I had read the book and I love it and this film too. Unlike the original book, the film starts as war between the Vikings of Berk and dragons. And during a dragon-attack, young Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, bought down a legendary \"Night Fury\" dragon with a bola-gun. Upon finding the dragon, Hiccup was about to kill the beast; but he couldn't bring himself to it. And Hiccup realize he couldn't kill a dragon, and it gets worse when his chieftain father enrolls him in dragon-slaying training classes. After training, Hiccup finds the Night Fury again trapped in a small canyon. Hiccup soon sees that one half of the dragon's tail wings was ripped off during his crash landing and has left him unable to fly. Trying to make things right, Hiccup slowly gains the dragon's trust and names him Toothless - though his teeth retract back into his gums when he's not eating, so he appears \"toothless.\" As the two continue to learn about each other, Hiccup constructs an artificial tail and saddle for Toothless, enabling him to fly again, but only with Hiccup's aid. Though Toothless, Hiccup learns more about dragons and that they are not the monsters the villagers think they are. Will their friendship last? Well, you will have to see the film for yourself. So overall, I love really this film from beginning to end.", "I have to admit, I didn't know anything about this movie until it started showing here in Manila around a week ago. The 3D version had just opened (if I'm not mistaken) a couple of days later and I invited my niece and nephew to watch with me (and my wife). Seeing how this was a Dreamworks movie (Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar), it was likely that I'd watch it anyway... the question is, will it be another Kung Fu Panda (which I rated a 10), or a Monsters Vs. Aliens (entertaining, but not a classic for years to come; or good enough to watch over and over again on DVD; let's face it, for every excellent Dreamworks animation like Shrek or Madagascar, there's a Shrek 2 or a Bee Movie). So I read up on reviews on a local website and on IMDb, and I was blown away by their reviews, both from critics and regular movie goers. People were generally pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed the 3D as well. So... I got all excited and had higher expectations all of a sudden. Now on to the movie. There were so many great things from this movie --- Entertainment - from a storytelling standpoint, this was up there with the best of Dreamworks animation; there was decent character development whether you empathize with the classic protagonist that's different from the rest of the Vikings or just appreciate the father and son relationship as it goes through the awkward years. The build-up from beginning to the climax was well done. There was much enjoyment all around with acceptable (and only occasional) lulls, and the lessons that can be learned were good and appreciable both from a child's standpoint and an adult's. Overall, How To Train Your Dragon (or some call it HTTYD) is a good blend of comedy, action and sprinkles of drama. After all, don't you want your animation to be a pretty good mix of everything?  Animation - Breathtaking; the aerial movements, the battles, the effects were all very good; not over the top, but released in appropriate doses needed to make every scene effective, memorable and entertaining. Watching in 3D adds more texture to the surroundings, puts the right amount of action at the right times, and was so generally well done that I hope this would be the benchmark of the perfect blend of cinematography and action using this technology (okay, this is not up there with Avatar's 3D but Avatar is technically live action, not animation). 3D doesn't have to be in-your-face like the old 3D's of Jaws or the more recent not-so-impressive 3D of Ice Age, or sometimes useless 3D used during the otherwise-touching and memorable movie \"Up\" Voice actors - Okay, that the children/teenage protagonists didn't have the requisite Viking (Scottish- or Irish-like) accents was strange, but if you wave off the inconsistency and suspend your disbelief there, I can understand why some reviews said that the choice of voice actors was just right, and not over-the-top overwhelming that they begin to define the humor, and effectively take over the movie (like Robin Williams in Aladdin or Eddie Murphy in Mulan/Shrek). I was half expecting Gerrard Butler to shout his famous line from 300, but he was all right, too. So I enjoyed that, hahaha. Dragons - maybe I was half expecting the dragons to speak but then again, that would have placed it into a box... a box of the usual Hollywood animation (or even non animation in cases like Dragonheart) crap. So this was good. You could still see it in the actions and expressions of Hiccup's dragon friend, \"Toothless.\" Plus they did a bang up job in portraying many different kinds of dragons. I thought that was quite intelligently conceptualized and implemented perfectly, from the wart-hog looking ones, to the two headed variety, there were plenty of dragons for everyone's enjoyment. Overall, this is a must-see movie for children and those who, like me, are children at heart. I enjoyed it enough to write a review again, hoping that those who are undecided will be convinced to watch it. Please do watch it, and look for that touching scene near the end between our young Hiccup and Toothless (made my eyes welt up just a little). No regrets in watching this. Even with heightened expectations, HTTYD still blew mine out of the sky. Or should I say dragon-blasted it? :-) Now to try watching it in Imax 3D before Clash of the Titans starts next week.", "I have never really been a BIG fan of Dreamworks Animation. And in saying that, yes, i am not the biggest \"Shrek\" lover. My theory is this......with Dreamworks animated films, the movie always has a spectacular first act, and usually has a pretty decent third act.......but the reason why the third act is always decent is because the second act always sucks. I kid you not, watch almost every Dreamworks animated movie and there is always.....ALWAYS a scene where our main character is walking alone by themselves kicking over rocks in an open field because they feel down about some stupid thing they did. Im sorry, but can we maybe switch it up a little? However, \"Kung Fu Panda\" did give me a glimmer of hope.......hopefully this movie can carry that torch. Finally, Dreamworks has got it right. They replaced the middle cheesy sequence with an actual storyline. The storyline is nothing above and beyond like PIXAR......but it is very entertaining non the less. The pace in this movie is done very well. Like most Dreamworks movies, i slowly begin to loose interest. But not with this one. It constantly feeds you entertainment with its story, and especially its character drive. Sure it doenst have you laughing non stop, but it replaces those laughs with a genuine story. From start to finish, i never lost interest. And i really think this storyline worked because they followed the same ethics that \"Kung Fu Panda\" and every PIXAR movie does......and that is bringing the movie full circle. Example: through an entire movie, you drop little pieces of a puzzle.......different problems or dilemmas that the main character is facing. Then you drop even more pieces.....pieces that make the main character happy. Then at the very end, the movie fits them all together for you........this movie did a fantastic job of doing just that. Also, one thing that i must point out more than anything else is the animation. This is hands down some of the most well crafted animation i have ever seen with my own two eyes. At times, i would literally wipe the drool from my face. Especially the sequence when our main character, Hiccup, takes flight with his dragon for the first time. I was in complete awe at how well it was done. Bottom Line, i will say that \"Kung Fu Panda\" is still my favorite Dreamworks movie......but this is still very worthy of mentioning. It really is entertaining from start to finish, and will produce fun for both adults and children alike. This has set a very high bar for future 2010 animated movies.", "Saw the movie yesterday and loved it. I found the books at Costco and bought a couple, read the first today, expecting it to be amazing since so often books outshine their movie counterparts. But on this one I'd say skip the book, go see the movie again. The movie may sell a lot of moms like me on the books, looking for something for their kids to read. But the kids will hardly recognize the book and the movie as having much to do with each other, beyond \"vikings,\" \"dragons,\" and some of the characters. Whoever converted the book into a screenplay did a wonderful job. The movie was great (see the other reviews) my only real comment on it was it amused me to hear Vikings with Scottish accents, and American accented kids. But hey, I stayed up late more than one night just to listen to Craig Ferguson talk so I'm not complaining too loudly.", "The new Dreamworks 3-D (the type with 3-D glasses) animation, How to Train Your Dragon, takes place in a Viking village. Over centuries, man and dragons have been enemies. Dragons kill people, take livestock, and burn their villages, while men have been trained to slay them. Stoick (Gerard Butler) is the leader of the clan, a master dragon slayer, and the protector of the village. To his disappointment, his son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), is the complete opposite of him\u2014timid, scrawny, and more brains than brawn. One day, using his engineering skills, Hiccup manages to capture a very rare type of dragon. Instead of slaying him, Hiccup lets him go and a secret friendship develops between them. Meanwhile, his Dad is also training him to be a dragon slayer. Despite what may sound like the usual generic Hollywood-type plot, the story is quite solid and characters are complex. I was constantly guessing how things were going to end up, despite guessing it'll probably be a happy ending, possibly\u2014there are many ways the film could've gone. There were many rooms for laziness in the plot, but I loved how they didn't do that\u2014things were constantly getting more interesting. The dialogue is very witty, with plenty moments of good irony. The flying scenes are, to put it simply, spectacular. This film shows why 3-D matters and I felt it really pushed the envelope, technically. The 3-D aspect in Avatar was accomplished, but the 3-D truly flourishes in this film. Few films make me feel like I've actually \"been there.\" This film does just that. I often worry about 3-D action scenes, fearing speed blurs will make it look odd\u2014no worries here. All the villagers feel real, emotionally, and are quite complex. The voice work by Jay Baruchel and the animation of Hiccup has so much layer and subtleties that I had forgotten I was actually watching animation. Character design-wise, Pixar may still have a slight edge in terms of everything looking \"marketable,\" but this is very solid work, and most of all, everything works so amazingly well together\u2014plot, characters, music, and technology. Some of the dragons do indeed look a little odd, but they serve the story. I loved all the adult Viking characters\u2014with their Scottish accents, huge beards, and the big warrior mentality--they're as fun as animation can make them. The relationship between Stoick and Hiccup is poignant, subtle, and more real than many live-action films. Gerard Butler's voice work for Stoick bring a lot of weight to the character. Overall, this film is an amazing showcase for the potential of 3-D. One must think, while 3-D is cool, the whole idea of 3-D is all about \"being there,\" it's not about merely watching two people talk, but about audience involvement. It's about going places where you can't go, doing things you normally can't do. I can imagine the application toward video games can be the next big thing. Meanwhile, this film is not only an accomplishment in the use of this new medium, but good story-telling, and fun characters. I give How to Train Your Dragon, *** \u00bd out of **** stars. For more of my reviews you can follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art", "This film is too overhyped and overrated. Just because it's one of the few Dreamworks films without pop-culture gags that was released in 2010 (a year of few very good movies) does not mean it's a masterpiece. First off, I will admit this has some good points. The music and animation are brilliant, and after the final battle our hero does not come out unscathed. But that's it. The film falls flat on so many levels. Astrid is just your usual \"violent-girl-turned-girlfriend\" character with no other personality whatsoever. And I hate that her \"punch-and-kiss\" gag is condoned. It should not be. It's not a healthy idea to promote that it's okay to show fondness of others through violence, nor has it ever been a healthy idea at all. Snot, Ruff and Tuff were jerks and karma eluded them despite their obnoxious behaviour - other than that, they were bland and just plain uninteresting. Fishlegs meanwhile is entirely a soulless, empty character. And Stoick is just an abusive parent who doesn't get what he deserves and frankly it's unfair how Valka from the second movie is just lambasted by fans while Stoick gets praised on \"how much of a good father he is\". Laughable. The only characters that one can root for are Hiccup, Gobber and Toothless. The rest of the tribe are either zombie-bland or hideous to the point that I wish that they were killed by the Red Death. They were just sheer unlikable jerks who gave Hiccup so much grief that the way they get off so easily at the end is legitimately horrendous writing. And Hiccup's character suffers from some stupid writing. We lost our leg? Never mind that (in under a minute) - happily ever after. Nearly everyone abuses me? Forget about that at the end! Happily ever after 'cause we won! So much crap happens to Hiccup that he should have had a scene where he calls out those who wronged him. But he doesn't. He's just another bland hero guy. The only reason why I root for him in this movie is that along with Toothless and Gobber, Hiccup is not an unbearable jackass unlike the rest of his tribe. But yes, bland hero writing and a lack of dire consequences (emotional scarring, anger at abuse, amputation freak-out, etc.) drag down this movie. There wasn't a single onscreen Viking death. Just how realistic is that?! Oh, and I also feel the need to mention that the Battle with the Red Death goes against the film's message of \"dragons are not bad and violence shouldn't be used as a first resort\". This movie was just pretentious and soulless. It's overrated and fails to get its mature ideas across. The sequel did a way better job at, well, everything.", "I am not a DreamWorks fan. At all. I get irritated when people compare them to Pixar, because when's the last time DreamWorks did anything memorable?! I've never even liked Shrek much! Most would answer my question with this: The most overrated animated movie of all time. It's about a Viking civilisation who have a on-going battle with dragons. A hapless son of the Viking chief begins an unlikely friendship with a dragon and realizes there's more to them. How To Train Your Dragon proves Pixar aren't the only ones who do great visuals, as it looks absolutely great. The story is deeper than one might expect and some of the flying sequences make you feel like you're flying with the dragons. It's a good visual experience and has a couple of good bits, but that's pretty much all I enjoyed. The main problem is that this doesn't tell me anything I haven't been told before. I've seen all these characters before. This story and moral has been done to death. When's the last time I saw animated humans and animals becoming friends? Or flying sequences? Or underdog stories? Maybe last week. The 90 minute run time is too short for an epic storyline. Too much of the film is rushed into montages and a lot of scenes feel rushed as a result. The film's emotional impact is minimal as the dialogue lacks flair and it moves along too quickly. The characters are some of the most clich\u00e9d I've seen in an animated movie, with the love interest having zero chemistry with the rather formulaic hero, although he's coolly named Hiccup. The script is so flat it might as well have been sat on by a dragon. It's not funny or particularly exciting and it feels like the same family feel good fare DW spit out at us year after year, their films like products on a conveyor belt leading out from a factory. This is not some great ground-breaking movie, rather a relatively ordinary and to be truly honest pretty darn boring affair. It looks great, but the story is irritating (Hiccup only gets accepted when he does something heroic) and everything about feels uninspired. It is another trip into clich\u00e9 town from DreamWorks. The only difference is that this time we're riding a dragon. What a waste of time!  4/10", "Rubbish title. Let's just get that out the way right now. It sounds like a working title that no one ever bothered changing. Dreamworks Animation Studio hardly provide intellectual competition for Pixar, but with the Shrek and Madagascar franchises, they certainly give kids a lot of what they want. With its comparatively sullen hues and a largely bodily function-free range of jokes, How to Train Your Dragon is likely to appeal to slightly older children. Not teenagers, but the bright brand of tweens who'll drool over the scene in which our bumbling hero, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), scans through a Book of Dragons, which acts like a kind of Dark Age movie merchandise catalogue. There's nothing drastically wrong with re-imagining the Vikings as victims defending their villages. But perhaps the film's closing pacifist sentiment comes across as a little disingenuous, given how much fun we've had watching arena battles and hundred-foot reptiles tear down mountains. I mean, after 90 minutes of rucking, will a child really want to put aside their plastic axe? Heavens no (or, indeed, Valhalla no) \u2013 he'll collect the toys, with their meticulously-moulded beards and scales, and play Dragon Massacre at Viking Village. But an enjoyable adventure nonetheless. The cast is excellent, once you get over the fact that the 28 year-old Baruchel sounds exactly what he is, which is fifteen years too old. And the 3D is dynamic and arresting without being distractingly self-referential.", "I think this deserves a rating of 7. Gave it a 1 because the rating was way too high in my opinion. When i watched it, i liked it. Good animation, that's the best about this flick. The story is mediocre, nothing exciting there. Don't misunderstand me, it does work! But let's be honest, it's not that exciting.... The soundtrack is what you expect it to be, nothing new/innovative there... So: Excellent film for your kids or for an adult who wants some excellent waste-time. But nothing exciting, innovative, surprising... If you're looking for something to rock your world, there's a lot of better animations out there (try Howl's moving castle, Princess Mononoke, ....)", "Yes. Because this was, indeed, a \"kiddies\" picture, I honestly did try to cut it some slack.... But, with that said - I ask you - Isn't it just like Dreamworks Studios (as is so with Disney Studios) to take a fantastic, ferociously destructive, mythical beast (such as a dragon) and (get this!) reduce it to being just a passive, toothless plaything?  Yep. And, so now that the Vikings (thanks to the misfit named Hiccup) no longer have any fear of dragons (who are now as gentle as baby lambs), then, I guess, they can all return to slaughtering each other with full gusto. And, speaking about the Vikings - This animated, CGI spectacle made it very clear that if one was such a person (as a Viking) that automatically excused all stupid behaviour - 'Cause, believe me, these people of Nordic ancestry (in this story) certainly strove to embrace stupidity in everything they did. Anyway - At a running time of 1 hour and 40 minutes, this film (from an adult's perspective) literally screamed out at the top of its lungs for some serious editing. It really did.", "Like some of the other reviewers here, the movie lost me fairly early with the Vikings having Scottish accents (and the kids having American accents). After \"Austin Powers\" and 800 Shrek movies and \"Brave\", haven't we gotten over the Scottish accent thing? Is that the ONLY accent that we can hear in animated movies anymore? Also, the dragon with the broken tail. The tail shouldn't have prevented him from getting off the ground. STEERING might have been a problem but not the flying part. You had the usual animated movie checklist: the wimpy boy who proves himself to the father who doesn't understand him (and to the local townspeople who make fun of him), the scrappy girl, etc. One clich\u00e9 after another. I'm tired of seeing the same movie over and over again. I know it's meant for kids and kids grow up to be replaced by other kids who HAVEN'T seen these before, I GET it....", "I get that this is a children's movie, but why do the older Vikings have Scottish accents while their offspring chat as though they've just left the mall, with American accents and rampant clich\u00e9s? The main character wants a girlfriend and is sad that he'll probably never get to go on a date ... wait, what? For that matter, why do ANY of the Vikings have a Scottish accent? o_O And did *any* female Vikings *ever* leave their homes and hearths, or whatever? Also, how come the dragon knew so many human gestures when he'd barely spent any time around the main character, or any other human? He's gesturing with his head at the fish, indicating that the boy must eat it, and mimicking the act of swallowing. Really, watching this you'd think there was nothing but a language barrier between humans and reptilian creatures. This movie's just ... silly. Way too childish. If you're over the age of 10, go watch Shrek again instead.", "This movie was pretty lame for the following reasons; The characters were crappy, annoying and forgettable (I only remember the names of Hiccup the protagonist, and toothless the dragon), the story was a boring generic fantasy viking genre, dialogue was pointless, music was crap, . The movie was good for the following reasons; The animation, voice acting, marketing and the title. So what I take away from all this is while the movie was crap at LEAST I saw it. I didn't just prejudge it, I saw it, thought it was crap and was able to write this comment it the first place.", "What an average movie. I'm not sure why I went to see it except it was one of the more-highly rated movies at the local 2nd-run theatre and I was bored. During the 1st 5 minutes, I became pretty certain I wasn't going to like the thing; I couldn't understand the dialog because of the high level of background noise: sound, explosions, mayhem, characters yelling. Who can tell what they're saying? Even during the opening scene when we're somehow flying toward the village at night, I couldn't tell what the narrator is saying. Have we seen this formulaic tripe before? Yes: Misunderstood motherless nerdy boy who has the capability to change the world, if only his father and others would listen. Did any one see Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs? Same story. The second thing was the accents of the characters: Scots were Vikings! Who knew?? Yet their children speak like modern day Americans and act like them too: cliquish, bullying brats. People are the same, century after century. The dragon, Toothless, looks nothing like a killer-turned-pet by the boy's kindness. No, he's one of the stupidest-looking characters ever; more like giant tadpole. How did he lose 50% of his tail wing? Doesn't matter; without that, there's no story. And who knew: dragons eat fish! They must be part pelican. Something else we didn't know! What an education.... I'm still trying to figure out if the dragon was telepathic or what; how else did he know where the boy wanted him to fly? How did the strategy of how to avoid the big Momma dragon (we are never really told what the big and only MEAN dragon was, except that dragons are like bees and ants: they have a queen. Wow! Lizards have Queen lizards! Another revelation! Take notes, kids!!) Yep; turns out all the man-killers are really kind-at-heart, misunderstood, over-large pets. All we ever really needed to do was walk up and pet them. Again: who knew? If only we were as wise as our children! is once again the moral. Parents are left apologizing and in awe of the kids. So much for Confucius. Finally, we learn that it's really OK after all to kill a dragon as long as it's ugly and as big as an entire city. Makes sense to me...", "I first watched the trailer of \"How to Train your Dragon\" about 2 months ago, thinking that this would just be another casual Dreamworks animated feature, with all the cheesy jokes and the pop-culture references included. However, this movie greatly surpassed my expectations. We are introduced to a vivid world, with plenty of color and movement, which makes it seem as lively as it should for the given context. The visuals are outstanding therefore no complaint there. The Characters may not be the most original ones, for example the main character being an underdog who wishes to go against the flow of his society in order to do the right thing etc etc, but they serve their purpose in the movie, and that's just fine. The characters are given all the depth they require and the whole film remains unharmed from this element. The Children will LOVE this movie. It's energetic, colorful, moving, funny... It has everything. I'm not saying it's masterpiece, but it definitely goes beyond the average animated flicks that Dreamworks previously presented. The whole experience, of course, is enhanced by the use of 3-D technology. Moments in the movie will literally take your breath away, especially during the dragon flying scenes, as the audience is given a realistic feel of hovering through mid-air. Bottom line; Go see this movie along with your kids (or even without, it doesn't really matter) and it is guaranteed that you will have a great time! 8/10", "\"How to Train Your Dragon\", or as I like to call it \"That Viking is out of my League\", is the second film in as many weeks where Jay Baruchel plays a scrawny nerd looking to find himself. It also happens to be infinitely more entertaining. He voices Hiccup, a hapless young Viking living in a village overrun by flying dragons. He longs to be like his great dragon-killing father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), and charm the likes of the beautiful Astrid (America Ferrara), with whom he is enrolled in dragon-battle training. While dragon-killing isn't for him, he soon finds a particular knack for dragon-whispering, subduing the beasts with his wits and even making a friend in one that he names Toothless. He soon realizes the reason for why the dragons are attacking and tries to convince dad that the winged creatures really aren't so bad afterall. Directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois have created a tremendous 3-D experience, setting the bar for animated 3-D much like \"Avatar\" set it for live-action. The dragon battles are thrilling and the flying scenes between Hiccup and Toothless soar with joy and pulse-pounding danger, and are magnified perfectly by John Powell's fantastic musical score. And at its heart this is a movie of friendship and learning to follow your own path, both movingly portrayed by Sanders and DeBlois' screenplay. The animation looks great, from the large, bushy-haired Vikings to the comically goofy looking dragons. The voice cast is also well-matched. Baruchel has a wheezy comic charm, Craig Ferguson gets the best lines as the village blacksmith, and who better to voice a Viking than Gerard Butler. \"Dragon\" is as heartfelt as it is impressive to look at, a family film perfect for all ages.", "DreamWorks Animation responds to Pixar's \"Up\" with \"How To Train Your Dragons\". The plot: in a mythical Viking kingdom, a young boy teaches his warmongering clan to put down their weapons and befriend dragons. To do this they must first....kill a giant dragon. It's one of many \"stop war, love nature\" films currently in vogue, the Viking's, like various US administrations, utilizing a blend of fear, hate and tradition to justify much rape and pillaging. It is this way of life which our young hero hopes to change, but the film's last act dragon murder plays more like a case of \"we destroy you, we take your weapons, you forced into friendship\" than a trans-species love affair. Now shut up and help me with this saddle. The film's plot strongly resembles \"Battle for Terra\", another animated film which covers similar ground. Both are preferable to James Cameron's turgid \"Avatar\". They're light, funny and move fast. See Miyazaki for the inspiration of most eco-friendly animated films. As with most CGI or animated films, \"How to Train Your Dragon's\" exhilarating moments are due largely to its free-wheeling, uninhibited, virtual camera work. The picture moves well, its virtual camera zipping along all axis, every minute detail and camera-move super precise. The levels of aesthetic control granted to the film-makers also allow \"Dragon's\" virtual landscapes (and conceptual designs) to be super fine-tuned, resulting in a certain aesthetic rush. The film's silent moments are powerful and its flying sequences are subline, given even Miyazaki's air songs a run for his money. Unfortunately the film's plot is nothing but a string of clich\u00e9s. It looks great, but it's a lightweight film. \"How to Train Your Dragon's\" score, by John Powell, has been praised, but again it can't touch either Korzeniowski's similar score for \"Battle of Terra\" or Joe Hisaishi's scores for Miyazaki. But that's the DreamWork's motto: good enough is good enough. \"How to Train Your Dragon's\" film-makers (a committee, auteurism is largely dead) make one interesting choice: after the film's climax, our hero, a mere child, loses his leg. His leg is then replaced with a prosthetic limb. It's a shocking moment for an animated film; the horrible consequences of hate. Incidentally, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is part of a longstanding battle between Pixar and DreamWorks Pictures (founded by Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen in the mid 90s). With the surprise success of Pixar's \"Toy Story\", DreamWorks set about discovering Pixar's next project. When their spies learnt of \"A Bugs Life\", DreamWorks then rushed out the similarly themed \"Antz\". Next from Dreamworks came \"The Prince of Egypt\" and \"The Road to El Dorado\", two animated films designed to rip off Disney's \"Hercules\" and \"Mulan\". Then came \"Sinbad\", a knock off of Disney's \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\". The battle continued with \"Shark Tale\", Dreamworks' copy of \"Finding Nemo\", \"Megamind\" which copies \"The Increadibles\", and \"Flushed Away\", which mimics \"Ratatouille\". Meanwhile, DreamWorks' monster movie, \"Shrek\", used a tale of monsters to poke fun at Disney, Pixar and Disney fairy tales, whilst Pixar's \"Monster's Inc\" celebrates the portals, multidimensional windows and doorways of business magnate Steve Jobs' \"Apple Computers\" (Jobs was chief executive of Pixar). No surprise then that the hero of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is called HiccUP, and that the film was the studio's response to Pixar's \"Up\". And so on and on it goes, corporate warfare and artistry dancing their intimate ballet. 7.9/10 \u2013 Despite a somewhat clich\u00e9d plot, this is one of Dreamworks' best animations. See \"Battle for Terra\", \"Castle in the Sky\", \"Porco Rosso\", \"The Sky Crawlers\" and \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds\". Worth two viewing.", "In a village of dragon-hunting vikings there is a clumsy boy who has no knack for fighting but rather for inventions. With one of these inventions, during an attack, he manages to hunt a dragon that lands some distance from the village but no one believes in him. Why? Had he lied before? The next day he finds the dragon but instead of killing it releases it, that way forming both a bond of friendship. In this way the little viking learns to tame dragons, and I find it incredibly stupid that in training classes no one realizes that he is just playing with the bugs. The story goes on with a few more conveniences, such as the love interest that seemed forced only after a little ride on the dragon's back. Some more conveniences happen that give rise to a hunt for the big giant dragon but the end of the film surprises in a sad way because the adventure cost a foot. It has good rhythm and action, but formulaic story full of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. Funny but little more.", "Like all of Dreamworks' animated films, you can pretty much predict every moment of How to Train Your Dragon from the film's opening sequence. In particular, the whole relationship between the father and son in this picture is so banal I had to roll my eyes every time the father character (voiced by Gerard Butler - for some reason, the major adult vikings in the movie all have Scottish accents) appeared on screen. So I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie a heck of a lot. And even after several days, my happiness with it has not diminished. I think most of that has to do with the relationship between the protagonist, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), and the dragon, Toothless. What can I say, I'm a sucker for any story about a person's relationship with their pet, and with the dragon so cat-like, the film was pretty much irresistible. The dragons are all fantastic, and the film truly comes alive whenever any of them (and especially when Toothless) is on screen. But, really, Dreamworks has never done better with their film-making. They've created a nice little world here. It has a texture and a beauty not before seen in Dreamworks animated features (though still a good deal below Pixar's last two films). Their last few films have had really well done action sequences, and Dragons keeps up with that quite nicely, putting the similar dragon flying sequences in Avatar to shame. DeBlois and Sanders previously directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch (pretty obvious when you compare Toothless's design to Stitch's), which has a similar charm.", "I came to this movie expecting a child's movie; a typical animation with your typical goofy lines and slapstick humor. Man, was I wrong. How to Train Your Dragon is the story of a viking boy, named hiccup, who wants to become a great dragon hunter. The problem is that he doesn't have the skill or brawn to do so. But, one night he manages to shoot out a dragon from the sky, and when he goes to where the dragon crash landed, he's faced with a tough decision. He frees the dragon from its entanglement, and from there his opinion on the creatures are changed. What made this movie so much better than most other animated films out there now-a-days is that it captures the heart-warming relationship between the boy and the dragon excellently and beautifully. It gives itself time to build up the characters, setting, and so on. It is not rushed, and you are able to soak up every touching, mesmerizing, and gorgeous moment at the perfect pace. It has a simple, but very effective story. There is no real mystery- drama twist, or some who-done-it tone, but a wonderfully charming and simple tale that, with its simplicity, can capture the hearts of young and old. The visuals are stunning. In fact, that is perhaps an understatement. I highly recommend this in 3D; the flying scenes felt so natural and engaging that the extra $3 per ticket is very much worth it. The battle scenes were wonderful; with a wide array of bright colors and some incredibly directed camera work (animated camera work), its hard not to grab the edge of your seat! The music, to say the least, is excellent. I'm not to great in describing music, but it fit the movie perfectly. It made the action scenes heart-pumping, the slow scenes compelling, and the flying scenes just perfect. Overall, with its beautiful story, vivid characters, excellent music, etc., I highly recommend this movie to anybody and everybody. It's a movie that does what a movie is supposed to do - enthrall, fascinate, and stir the emotions of its viewers, and not to mention, tell a really good story.", "In all honesty, I really didn't want to see this movie. I went with my family not expecting much out of it but it has undoubtedly exceeded every other movie this year (so far). Now what has it exceeded and how? As much as it is unfair to pit the special effects of a full CGI movie against movies like Alice in Wonderland. But the spectacle is amazing, especially in 3D. The flying scenes feel like some ride from Disney world. And the climax at the end raised some goosebumps. The plot is fairly predictable, but good. All of the actors give great voice performances, truly making you care about the characters. I have to say, after many cheesy kids movie saying that they are for the whole family, How to Train Your Dragon was a huge relief. Whether you are coming in as a pessimist or an optimist, you will love this movie. 9/10 Absolutely amazing.", "Dreamwork's How To Train Your Dragon is the story of a viking boy named Hiccup. Hiccup is not the typical viking however, as he is as skinny as a toothpick and by all means a nerd, if it were possible to have nerds back then anyway. Hiccup is born into a world where you are born and raised to fight, and kill dragons. But something about this doesn't seem quite right to him, so instead going down the path to become a mighty warrior Hiccup becomes the blacksmith's apprentice. This is a perfect fit for him, as he can tinker and invent new objects. Hiccup sets out to prove his worth by capturing the rarest and most dangerous dragon called the Night Fury, which is the B-2 stealth bombers of dragons. Hiccup does just that and uses a net to capture the dragon. The dragon flies off and Hiccup must wait until morning to go out and find it. Once he comes across it he thinks about killing it, to seek the townsfolk and even his fathers approval. But alas, killing is just not in the blood of Hiccup, and he frees the dragon. The dragon tries very hard to fly away yet is missing a piece of his back wing, therefore losing all stability in air and falling on his face every time. Hiccup eventually names the dragon Toothless, builds a prosthetic wing for him and away the dragon goes, with Hiccup riding shotgun. The animation styling of the movie is excellent. The movie is from the same team that brought us Lilo and Stitch, and you can tell they really put a lot of love into this movie. From the landscapes to the various camera angles, everything was done to give an epic and open feel to the world. The dragons look amazing and it was nice to see a variety of them rather than just one breed. For instance there is a two headed dragon called the Zippleback where one head breathes the gas while the other shoots a spark out to light the flame. But where this movie really shines is in it's ability to bring personality to every creature and viking in the story. The dragons in particular are brilliantly animated, which has to be some feat. I fell in love with the Night Fury and wanted to take him home with me. The story line is original and heartfelt, and I feel that both parents and children will really enjoy this movie. The 3D in this movie was done very well. It had a very organic feel to it. Even though the film may be animated, the camera shots made you feel like you were peering through a window to an unknown world, and watching the ride. One of my favorite 3D moments was Hiccup flying around on the dragon and into the dragon's lair. There were hundreds if not thousands of dragons flying around almost like bats in a cave, and it looked great. Another pretty cool moment is right at the start of the film where dragons firebomb the town the vikings live in. The action is intense and watching massive fireballs dart throughout the night sky is wonderful. There were a few gimmicky moments but it was nothing that took away from the film, and nothing that felt out of place. I did notice some ghosting but I am not sure if it was from this particular movie screen, or the movie its self. Outside of that there is really no complaints I have about the 3D effects. In fact I would have to say this was the 2nd best 3D film I have seen, behind Avatar of course. How To Train Your Dragon will be one of the best animated movies of 2010. You will walk out of this movie feeling good. Although it may seem like a kids movie, any one of any age will enjoy this movie, except maybe the rebellious teenager who is not impressed by anything.", "This movie soars. A simple story beautifully told. Tolerance, understanding, and parental approval themes are explored with charm, humor and grace in this great adventure. The story of a Boy and his Dragon is beautifully animated, well voiced and very well made. Part of the beauty of the script is Toothless, the Dragon has no dialogue. Hiccup, the boy, looks like Conan O'Brien and Toothless the dragon looks like Stitch of Lilo and Stitch. The film makers will only have themselves to sue. The film may be too intense, and too loud in 12000 watts of Imax sound, for smaller children. This film will be remembered at Oscar time. Don't wait. See it now in 3D.", "How to Train Your Dragon tells the story of \"Hiccup\", a skinny, quirky young boy growing up in a Viking village. He's clumsy, intellectual and prone to inventing things using the raw technology available at the time. The village is a difficult place to live and the Vikings are portrayed as big, beefy, hearty men and women who have to fight not only the elements but invasions of attacking dragons, which they've fought for generations. The Vikings in the village define their lives through their battles against the dragons, and Hiccup's father is the biggest and bravest of them all \u2013 and the leader of the village. He thinks Hiccup is not cut out for dragon-battle despite Hiccup's desire for just that very thing. Hiccup is fascinated by a blonde warrior Astrid, who in training can hold her own against the boys her own age with whom she is training. There are many, many types and varieties of dragons shown in the movie, but the most elusive one \u2013 that no one has ever seen, is the mysterious and super-fast Night Fury. Hiccup uses one of his gadgets to bring down the Night Fury far from the village. Of course no one believes him, and he goes out in search of the deadly dragon. Finally Hiccup finds it (he names it \"Toothless\" ) and the film is basically about how they come to be friends. From Toothless Hiccup learns how to train dragons and appears to subdue them in dragon battle training. Astrid is none too happy about it because she wants to be the number one pupil \u2013 eventually of course she decides to find out how exactly Hiccup is learning all these things and stumbles across his secret. Overall I found How to Train Your Dragon to be great fun with the animation very detailed and awesome.", "One of my favorite animated movies of all time. This movie is a really fun movie and has great characters. The music cue called Romantic Flight that played when Toothless took Hiccup and Astrid on a flight was a very beautiful piece of music. My favorite moment in the entire film was when after Hiccup had woken up and come out of his house, he was punched by Astrid for scaring her and then given a kiss on the lips by Astrid for everything else. Another thing that was really good about the movie was the music and how it was used very well to represent what was going on. The fact that certain music was meant for certain situations and people was great. Overall this movie is a wonderful movie. My score for the film is a 10/10.", "This is the best animated movie ever! It's breathtaking, amazing and dragon-tastic! You'll definitely love it.  Well, in my opinion, Pixar is way better than DreamWorks SKG. However, DreamWorks has something which no Pixar nor Disney can do:They can make us (fandoms) fall in love with the characters they make.  The script is awesome. And, when you watch it, you do not feel like it is a movie. Talking scenes are so sincere that you do not feel like you are actually watching a movie. It makes you believe. My most important animation movie credit is, making the audience believe. This is a movie make you believe those legendary creatures. It will definitely make all children -and children souled adults- wonder \"Is there an island named Berk?\" or \"Were there dragons in ancient times?\". It even makes an adult believe it. Probably, just for a second, but for a second, they believe there is nothing named \"impossible\". Perfect movie. Don't die before watching.", "A hapless young Viking (Jay Baruchel) who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" had an unfortunate bit of timing on its release. In probably any other year, it would have been a front-runner for an Oscar, but it had to face off against \"Toy Story 3\", one of the more powerfully emotional animated films in recent memory. With its breathtaking animation, HTTYD easily outdoes \"Toy Story\" in its innovations, but you just cannot argue with emotion. The film also has a great metaphor on war, and those who are different. Some might dismiss this as liberal nonsense, and perhaps it is to some extent. But there is clearly a parallel to the real world: many wars that are fought may be against an enemy who never wanted to be an enemy in the first place. Of course, this is not universal; there was no alternative to war with Hitler (see the second film)... but maybe we should start seeing our enemies from their own point of view.", "Loosely based on the Cressida Cowell book series about a teenage boy named Hiccup (Baruche) who aspires to be a dragon slayer just like everyone else admirable in his mythic Viking community. Due to Hiccup's small stature, his goals seem unlikely, until he successfully injures a rare Night Fury (a highly intelligent breed of dragon evolved for speed and stealth)\u0085 but he instead befriends it, suddenly losing all desire to pursue a career in slaying these misunderstood creatures. One can't help but reminisce on the funny scenes in SUPERBAD, what with common cast and crew members Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse in supporting roles, and Victor Pesavento and Mark Graham in the music department. All-in-all, a magical movie for adults and children alike\u2014a true family flick. It's easy to become attached to the dragons since they are obviously modeled shamelessly after cute animals that we keep as pets (the dragons purr like cats for cryin' out loud!\u2014how can you not like them?). If dragons were real, your kid would want one after seeing this movie. Available in 3D, but it's still breathtaking even in 2D. ***\u00bd (out of four)", "There's no fun writing good reviews about movies that are commonly seen as good, or the other way around. It feels pointless, like repeating the obvious. But sometimes people seem to be mesmerized by the look-alikes and simply forget what it is to deal with something truly original and precious. So when i first saw How to Train Your Dragon back in 2011, i didn't find it necessary to say anything: anyone with eyes and ears would've understood everything without help from aside. Or so i thought. But after the excitement and praise the HTTYD's sequel received in 2014, with some even claiming that it surpassed its predecessor, it got obvious that eyes and ears are not enough: only with your mind and heart open you can feel the movie's \"soul\" if it has it, or notice its absence if it doesn't Some details of the original movie might've faded in memory with time. But a single re-watch made them all vivid again. And, the most important thing, brought back that magical feeling that made me instantly fall in love with this movie back in the day. As if you are transferred from the cozy modern environment to a world full of scary and dangerous things and creatures, and the only thing that could compare with that fear of unknown is the curiosity and eagerness to finally find out the secrets it contains. But HTTYD is more than just about exploring the unknown that's around you. It's also about the search of your own true self, about questioning the stereotypes based on fear and, above all, about kindness and compassion, and how such things can actually change the set order of things. The protagonist named Hiccup, is a nerdy and tiny son of the gigantic and brutal chief of the Viking tribe, people who may pray the Norse gods but whose true god is strength and toughness. Being a total failure in his people's eyes, he desperately tries to prove himself worthy and to kill a dragon, only to find out, when he finally gets a chance to, that his heart goes against it. And so begins a story of a person who, in the world where people are taught to kill first and ask questions later and nobody bothers to think whether it's right or wrong, decides to take a different path. Which leads to things like accepting who you really are, standing up for it and finally making a difference. And finding things that you were so desperate to find, like love and approval, along the way. In the world ruled by the machismo stereotypes, it's especially refreshing to see movies where silly and clumsy characters who, on the other side, have a soft and kind heart, may actually save the day and even be sexy. The same approach worked brilliantly in another Dreamwork's gem, Kung-Fu Panda. But the magical spell would not be complete without amazing visuals and a truly beautiful score. Seriously, unlike the sequel's soundtrack that was borderline annoying, so excessively vigorous it was sometimes, in HTTYD we have a great mix of a whole variety of themes, from suspenseful to gentle to cheerful to really epic and fist-clenching, each of them perfectly complementing the actions we see on screen. And the scenes of Hiccup and Toothless just flying in the sky, free from everything that confined them on the ground... That was just an indescribable experience that only HTTYD and Avatar ever managed to deliver. As if you're up in the sky yourself, gliding through the clouds with no care in the world... Alas, all the fairy-tales are bound to end sooner or later, and this movie was no exception. Still, i'm utterly grateful to the team behind HTTYD for creating something that, even for an hour and a half, turns you into a child again and lets you feel the magic long gone from our own reality.", "This first part of 'How To Train Your Dragon' takes us into the magical world of vikings and dragons. Most of these movies have a seemingly good-for-nothing lead who no one has any hope for, and then he charms everyone by something great. Though that part seems too familiar, don't dismiss it yet; the characters, the dragons, the training, the aerial rides and battles, every single thing in this movie is uniquely fascinating. The lead character has a really amusing name, Hiccup. The bond he forms with the one-of-a-kind dragon (Night Fury) named 'Toothless' and the way they grow together is really intriguing and thrilling to watch. Their air rides are really breathtaking. All the characters are quite interesting, and each of them have something to offer. Though none of the characters were developed properly, the screenplay, the animation and the brilliant voice-overs compensate for them. Looking everything from different points-of-view, applying a lesson learnt from one thing on another thing and going against others to do something which ones gut says are just few of the lessons the movie teaches. Quite an inspiring movie.", "there are Vikings that fight dragons.One Viking does not want to hurt a dragon and so the dragon gets hurt so the kid goes and save the dragon and the dragon hurts its wing and the kid cant tell his dad about the dragon so I think it was really good. the kid fights with other Vikings and with other dragons and than they all become friends and the kid makes a wing for the dragon and the dragon is weak and the dragon does not like it so he puts it on the dragon and the dragon works with him and fly's with him. and he falls but the kid works with him and than they become friends and the movie is really good I think the kids will like it.", "I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's written well, the voice acting is great, the story is fast paced and engaging, but above all, it's just really quite beautiful to look at - and this was in 2D, so I imagine the 3D experience would have been even more of a treat. This film works on just about every level. The main characters especially are a highlight - the protagonist gives us a very fresh take on your standard misfit boy type and his pacey and entertaining dialogue is constructed and delivered flawlessly. Even the dragon has more personality to it than most of the stale characters you tend to see in contemporary children's' movies - its design and facial expressions alone are just so well done they convey everything effortlessly. There isn't much to the story but then there doesn't need to be. It's a solid family adventure to keep everyone entertained. Where some previous Dreamworks films have failed to keep both child and adult audiences I feel that this one captures both successfully because the dialogue is just so tight and funny and children would just be captivated with the beauty and excitement of what they're seeing.  I'm struggling to say anything negative about this movie at all, in fact. It's just very very good. Go and see it. 9/10.", "This movie had me captured from start to finish. Although predictable as with 99% of movies made, this movie created a need to see the twists and turns associated with each character. I found myself wanting to be the weak hiccup, with the will to succeed even when told by his own father he isn't up to the job. The characters were very lovable each in their own right and worked very well together. Casting could not have been better, complimenting the already well written plot. I was very impressed by the way the flight of the dragons was as would be expected and did not look fake. Taking into account gravity, wind and other factors. The wings bellowing with wind in them. Overall I would say that this movie is the one to see in 2010 and certainly the best I have seen for this year. Very easy for the whole family to enjoy. Thank you for the experience.", "I have two girls here that loved the hell out of the movie. And they look good! What else do you need from a review?  The animation is pretty nice, even if 3Dish, with very realistic facial expressions, bright colors and large landscapes. The plot is kind of classic, with the weird kid who longs for his father's acceptance and the love of the town's girl getting his wish. The twists are that the kid is a viking and their entire village is plagued by pesky dragons. In the end, a peaceful solution is found, even if a bit ironic. Let's say it's a typically human solution and leave it at that. What I liked about the movie is that the animated characters were not mere projections of the actors playing them, and the animals were not anthropomorphised versions of their real selves. Actually, the black dragon with big green eyes looked and behaved suspiciously like my black cat with big green eyes. Only a bit smarter... and flying. Clearly a cat lover worked on this film. Bottom line: has a Shreky freshness to it, even if the script is not parody funny, but situation funny. Good quality in animation, voices, direction and storyline. The ending was a bit mushy, but full of good tension and held itself well. Oh, and the girls loved it.", "Loved it. They took clich\u00e9s and overused ideas and made them watchable, interesting, catchy. Therefore, this is a good movie not thanks to the plot, but because of how it's coated in an innovation veil. Not the plot is what gives this animation a fresh appearance, but the details. They made dragons look so adorable, friendly and helpful, I almost forgot they're not real and started to think during the movie that I should buy me one of those. A good distribution of the action scenes, comedy ones and emotional ones. Not too much or too little of any of these. Not a very forceful outburst of the climax, but can't complain, either.  I don't quite understand why the name of the main character is Hiccup - even though there is an explanation given at the beginning of the movie, it's not enough for me. But that's just me. These being said, I think 8 is an appropriate mark.", "When I saw the commercial for \"How to Train your Dragon\" on TV, I thought to myself, \"Why are they doing this? It looks so stupid.\" My friends finally convinced me to go see it-- and I walked out of the theater that day with a whole new mindset. It. Was. Amazing. The music was the first thing I noticed. It has a sort of Celtic, old Norse vibe, which kept the movie lively and unique. And, the character of Hiccup (played by Jay Baruchel, whom I love), well, I fell in love with him from the beginning. He's like the basic humble, clumsy guy that ends up the hero, yeah all that normal stuff. But I was really...convinced by him; he was easy to relate to, for me. And he was pretty cute, too, in an animated sort of way. And I absolutely loved Hiccup's relationship with Toothless. That dragon reminded me of my cat, so it was adorable. Although there are some critics that say that this movie copied the plot of the well loved Disney classic \"Pocahontas\", I say, no way! There are some similarities, but the plot remains unique and different, while still managing to be very humorous and warmhearted. It's been a long time since I've liked and animated film, and this one is definitely the most beautifully done. I might even buy it (I usually don't). So, see it! I 1000% recommend it!", "When i heard the title the first time in a teaser i thought its another nice little family movie with some scary creatures. I was so wrong: How to train your dragon is THE ultimate animated (3-D) movie in 2010! It was so worthy watching every second. So worthy i've watched it 5 times! And i only watch some great movies normally no more than 3 times (Like Transformers, POTC or Avatar). But HTTYD is an outstanding achievement in digital movie-making and its a pleasure watching how Toothless becomes friends with Hiccup - at the end i can say: Hiccup and Tothless changed the live of both dragons and humans in and around Berk. i also heard about that sequel - i can't wait to see it! Both thumbs up in the air and never take them back down again! This film has to win the Oscar, at least best animated picture... but that's just me... thanks for reading...", "If you haven't seen HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON yet, you're missing out. Tight script, great actors with good timing, really interesting animation and cool characters (OK how cute was that night-terror dragon?). Hiccup is your average misfit that takes on the adventure of a lifetime. Lovable, dorky, and a good heart, you're rooting for him every step of the way. There's action, adventure, battles with some really crazy dragons, comedy, and lots of amazing things that you wouldn't expect from the trailer. Watch it. Possibly the best film of 2010 so far. 10/10", "Not bad for a family movie. Nerdy kid Hiccup finds a injured dragon, turns him into a pet and friend. The nerdy kid is the son of a Viking village leader, voiced by Gerard Butler, who is learning how to fight dragons. On his off time he helping the dragon fly again and learning good things about his new pet dragon. Story was good but not great. It was missing the little side jokes and pop culture that is usually in kids movies now days. The voice acting was good with some new names\u0085but it mostly feels like a long Saturday morning cartoon, it is only about hour and half. The graphics were a little on the cheap side and the soundtrack felt low budget also. My 8yr old liked it but my 10yr old found it OK. It is still a solid movie for family fun. My rating is based on the RE-watch-ability factor. Like the movie Robots, Space Chimps or Meet the Robinsons\u0085you know good but not great. Worth watching at a discount theater or buy it used.", "I loved this film, and I do not say that often. It just reached out and grabbed me. This is a film that sparks the imagination. The views of mountains, trees, and ocean went right to my heart; and the characters were so well realized I can easily imagine them going about there lives off-screen. The jokes were hilarious\u2014I'm still laughing. And the music! I'm surprised more people aren't talking about the music. This may just be one of the best movie scores of our time. Whether or not it will be fully appreciated when showcased in a family film is in doubt; but, hey, you can only shake your fist at life's unfairness for so long. Not only does the score perfectly compliment each scene (I really don't think it was ever off, even a second!), it's breathtakingly beautiful. It is definitely worthy of an Academy Award nomination. This film has a wonderful tenderness to it, and it is just plain joyful! Thank you, DreamWorks!", "\"How To Train Your Dragon\"- A guide to successful domestication. Or a really awkward title for a porn film.  As with most films, I went with certain expectations, but all of them, were exceeded as the ending credits rolled out... and made me head down to the nearby adoption center, in hopes of finding a baby dragon. No luck.  Dreamwork's latest film is directed by Dean DeBlois & Chris Sanders and written by Cresida Cowell, is voice cast by such stars as Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrara, Craig Ferguson.  The premise?  In a mythical land, where Vikings favorite pastime activity is hunting fire-spitting pests, dragons, a muscle-ridden teenager by the name of Hiccup (voice by Jay Baruchel) tries to constantly \u0084make a mark\" on the 300 year old war with little or no success. Actually, with no success at all.  Until one day, he get's lucky, and catches the most feared dragon of all, Night Fury, \u0084the unholy offspring of lightning and death\", and an unlikely friendship develops.  What seemed to be playing with fire, turns out to be more like sitting next to it, and enjoying the warmth. As Hiccup is forced into How-to-kill-a-dragon 101, he realizes that \u0084all they know about them is wrong\". Unfortunately, his father Stoick, (voiced perfectly by Gerard Butler) does not share his approach...  \u0084How to Train your Dragon\" is an animated film, full of heart, with a healthy emotional dose, stitched together with thrilling aerial sequences, that put 3D to it's best use \u2013 it puts you, where the action is. And, what's a rare trend in animated films, the film is practically pop-culture free.  The character designs don't disappoint, but also don't thrill... That is until you see the dragons. Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head. Give them a twist a flick of the wrist, That's what the showman said... Sorry\u0085  The Dragon's design heavily reflects their personalities - a bumble-bee like dragon is a bit slow on the uptake, while a sleek-designed dragon, like Night Fury, is fast and smart, kinda like a heat-seeking missile). Also, what I really liked about them, is that eventually they turn out to have pet-like behavior. They like being scratched on the back, they get high on blades of grass and if you share a fish with them, they'll love you forever.  The entire voice cast is a perfect fit for the film's characters. Gerard Butler, with his overpowering, hoarse, deep-throat voice, goes perfectly with Stoick's over-muscular statuesque (Sparta is proud of you!) Jay Baruchel is AMAZING! His voice acting gives Hiccup so much credibility as a boy with unlimited fervor but limited by his surroundings. And then we also have Craig Ferguson voicing Gobber, the village's blacksmith who has a blanket-like quality to his voice \u2013 warm & fuzzy. And there are many more talented voice cameos, who carry themselves quite well throughout the film.  You can just tell, that Dreamworks tried Pixar's approach... They gave the story a lot of thought and consideration. Like it would be their first and last animated film for which they'd be remembered. Show, don't tell \u2013 it's that simple. \u0084Up\" did it, so can you!  One bad thing is, that the film seems a bit sequel-ready. No need for future installments to ruin the charm of the first one. Remember \"Shrek\"? You will not burn yourself on \u0084How To Train Your Dragon\". Instead you will be pleasantly meant with warmth and understanding, that we can all coexist with each other.  Pixar, watch your back, Dreamworks is sneaking up.", "These movies \"for kids\" sometimes turn to be tedious attempts to provide a moral and lessons for the youngsters and they finish losing the main purpose, that is what we liked when we were kids, to be fun. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" fulfills all the expectations, and for this reason it's recommended not only for children, but also for adults like me who refuse to grow up. I love the Brit & American mix in the voices (I must confess I'm a big fan of Craig by the way), and specially the warmth in the voice of Jay Baruchel what makes Hiccup a believable -and lovable- character. In conclusion: Highly recommended for all ages.", "this movie is so awesome. I brought my cousin with me to the movies and at the very end scene I looked a her and said \"What are you doing?\" and then a second later she started to cry and she said \"This movie is so sad! I don't want to see this!\" (she's 5 years old) But the story was amazing. THis is why i love animated movies! The characters were well made! THe best dream works movie ever! The dragon is so cute! he reminds me of my dog. This movie is family fun for everyone! It's a good movie of friendship. This movie has a lot of feelings of laughter happiness and sadness. Go watch this movie now before it's too late. hurry! 9/10", "Having viewed this movie a few months ago, when a long and cold and moist winter made my country shuddering, I now remembered that I wanted to write a review. At first I have to say that I personally hate(d) 3D because I'm one of those Kings between the blind, so Stereo-3D is complete useless for me, except that it's more expensive. I always refused to view one of those new 3D movies with my children, because I was afraid to lose viewing quality.. With 'How to Train Your Dragon' I wasn't able to withstand the strong desires of both my daughters, and agreed to wear those idiotic carnival glasses during the movie. Thanks to modern techniques, my fears were unsubstantiated and I was able to enjoy the movie's visual quality with my only one working eye, like it would be a normal 2-D animated film. At first I realized that this was going be a very modern 'Wickie re-imaged'. If you don't know the animated series from the 70's, Wickie is a young Viking who is small but imaginative and inventive, with long blonde hair like a girl, and not a fighter like his rather dumb but strong father Halvar (The Great). After his father realizes that he has a very special son, not the usual brute dude to be proud of, but someone who saves him and his crew permanently from dangerous situations, he accepts him instantly. Any similarities there ? Yes you see, they stole heavily. But in this movie the young hero has much more to do to convince his father being a son to be proud of. He is much more a loser, like the young son in 'Cloudy...' where is a big language barrier between father and son which hinders them from communicating in the right way. Interesting that in many of those movies today where the son is such a soft and weak and girlish loser in the first place, there is an absence of the mother (Wanted, Kick-Ass), which may come from divorced authors who always dream about having their children. However, 'Wickie' has a mother in the series, the usual Viking sized Mum, who serves at home for the good of the family (but doesn't hesitate to confront her mighty husband when he's doing wrong in her view). But for the audiences of today, simple adventures seemingly ain't enough to make a movie interesting for them. There have to be some special dangerous but likable and fascinating thing, and what's more kind of that than dragons ? Now, the first appearance of the night-shadow dragon in this movie was very disappointing for me. It looks like Stitch whose look and feel I always hated. Nevertheless I felt from the first minute viewing an extraordinary production, because of the sympathetic and differentiated characterizations of all persons. I wondered how 'acting' Hiccup was animated, I enjoyed the obviously teen targeted funny dialogs, and I got dizzy from the great flight scenes even in my personal 2-D. Surely the story is predictable and the characters are clich\u00e9, but I can appreciate good and moody clich\u00e9, if it's not bothersome and if it has some fresh updates. After the movie is so much filled with things children love, with adventure, drama (yes they do love drama), about growing up, first love, finding your abilities, understanding together, it won't get along without some stereotypes, otherwise it wouldn't be so easy to understand (which is mandatory for a children's film). After leaving the cinema my two daughters and I were completely happy and heart-warmed, so this was a very good investment, and I will also get over the additional costs for the DVD, because this is a movie you can enjoy more than once.", "Well, to be honest i became crazy about these animated flicks these days. I fell in love for the first time when I watched \"The Lion King\" some ten years ago. Then watched the toy story series, Shrek series, Ratatouille, Wall E , Up and now this \" How to train your dragon\". And the fun gets doubled now with the 3d effects incorporation. Hiccup a small Viking Kid always wants to go for a raid on the dragons in their locality. But his father didn't allow to do so. One day, he wins over a mysterious night fury dragon with his invention. He calls it toothless and as expected a great friendship has begun. Hiccup understands dragons are not dangerous as they thought and he wants to show his people the truth. But fate plays the other way leading the dragons to attack them. How he befriends the other dragons and how they win the battle with the help of toothless is the story which is so beautiful to see. These animation cinema works only when it has a great plot to back it up. Here it has and works like a charm. Technology and style don't win over the script, which is hard to perceive these days. Though it comes with a tag of 3d, deliberately nothing was shot to utilize only the technology. The effects are minimal however when required, its done with a knack to surprise us. The background score is another important aspect of an animation flick. Remember the Lion king's one? And here its amazing. This is a simple story told with interesting characters and stunning visuals. The CG is growing leaps and bounds and the result we see in the screen. Animated flicks are no more children movies, it has more to offer with substance as well as with its visuals.", "Anybody who says they're too old to watch an animated movie needs to get their head out of their ass. The animation creates endless amounts of possibilities, and makes the movie so stunning that we are immediately drawn into their world. But it can also create stories that live-action movies can't. How could you make Toy Story with people? Put a cowboy hat on Tom Hanks and put wings and a helmet on Tim Allen? I don't think so. How to Train Your Dragon is another movie that could only be made through the magic of animation. It has heart, intelligence, and humor that some live-action movies could only dream of. Here is the plot summary from IMDb.com: A hapless young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed. That's the plot, but this isn't a movie about plot-it is about the relationship between a young boy and his dragon. If you've ever had a dog or a cat that you were close to, then this will definitely remind you of it. Like when he scratches the dragon's chin and it falls to the ground in ecstasy; when the kid shines a light on the ground and the dragon tries to catch it; or when the dragon brings a dead fish for the boy to eat. They have the best kid-pet friendship since My Dog Skip. I would very much recommend this film to anybody. The kids will like it for its cool animation, light comedy, and charming story; but an adult will like it because it is smart, deep, emotional, and very funny. It has some very subtle dirty moments, and I'm pretty sure I heard the f-word a couple of times. Just go see it, you definitely won't regret it.

Recent posts include a countdown of the Top 10 movies of 2010 so far, Top 10 fantasy movies of all time, and reviews of Just Wright, Date Night, and A Nightmare on Elm Street. franklinreviews.blogspot.com", "In recent years there has been a large surge in 3D films which has caught the industry by storm. However, 3D films are terrible if they don#t have a great storyline behind them because then they just turn out like 2012, loads of effects and not a lot else, aka Rubbish. Luckily HTTYD has a great story line, the traditional unpopular protagonist who overcomes something or other by alternative methods and saves the day, with plentiful lashings of viking-esquire styling to boot. The plot is good fun and quirky with a good ending and the flying scenes appeal to myself greatly, although that might be due to the fact that dream about such things. The 3D aspect of the films is a little under par in my opinion but not to the point that it is bad, it is just I have scene 3D done better. There are a couple of surprise actors, namely Gerard Butler (300), which where a welcome surprise and gave that film a familiar dimension which helped in some way or another. Either way, it is was fun to watch and an enjoyable side to a nice packet of crisps.", "Pixar now faces serious competition.This is definitely the front runner for the Academy Awards this year.\"How To Train Your Dragon\" is an masterpiece from Dreamworks,better than all their movies.This movie was just amazing. This movie had everything - a decent story, witty dialogues, awesome score ( by John Powell ), crisp animation and the 3-D adds beauty to the film. I completely enjoyed this film from the beginning to the end.I liked Toothless a lot.The scenes involving Hiccup and Toothless were mind blowing.I particularly liked the scene where Hicup takes Astrid for a ride on Toothless. Its 98 minutes of pure fun...................Enjoy the Movie", "Hiccup is a viking, the only problem is he doesn't seem to fit in with everyone else. He's scrawny, scared and can't kill a dragon when given the opportunity. Instead, he makes a unique friendship with the one dragon that people never seem to see. He learns that everything he knew about dragons was wrong and he must stop his father and the other vikings from killing more of them. How To Train Your Dragon seemed like another animated film that would come and go at the snap of a finger. Yet, it somehow managed to be the best review film of the year (so far) and rake in the cash. Word of mouth spread and along with the critical backing, the film has managed to stay in the top spot for awhile. So I decided to give it a chance. While the film is not as emotionally engaging as other animated films of recent years, it still manages to have fun and entertain. The voice acting from all was really well done. I had fun spotting who was who and each one gives their character that unique little bit of spice. Jay Baruchel has whiny brat down to a tee, almost to the point of annoyance. With the exception of America Ferrera, I was able to point out every voice actor, yes even the guy from Cloverfield. Her character, Astrid, who isn't in the book, is the love interest of our lead. She is the tough one who is jealous of Hiccup when he starts to get the spotlight for knowing how to handle the dragons. This relationship is never the focus point and seemed rushed, but I can live with it. The animation at times looks marvelous, the fur the vikings wear looks great. At other time it looks a bit weak, specifically the lead dragon. I don't know if it was the stylistic choice of making him look like a cat, but it looked like the weakest part of the animation to me. Which is funny, because the dragon was the best part of the film. Toothless, as he is called, was funny, cute and kick-ass. The scenes in which he is flying with Hiccup were really well done and added the sense of excitement and adventure the film needed. It has laughs here and there, but never did I find it overly funny. Instead it plays out the family friendly adventure spin. The story itself is nothing new, young outcast needs to win the hearts of those around him. Finds an unfamiliar friendship and uses it to his advantage. The setting of dragons and vikings was the new angle the film gave us. The relationship between Hiccup and toothless is a nice addition to a spew of films in which the lead character makes friends with an animal.  While How To Train Your Dragon doesn't go leaps and bounds over anything else, it is one of the better films Dreamworks has managed to kick out recently. Both adults and kids will enjoy this film.", "Considering for a moment \"How to Train Your Dragon\" and \"Kung-Fu Panda\" as a kind of couplet for Dreamworks Animation, they seem to be acquiring great skill in hitting these stories well out of the park. This is great, solid stuff: Neatly buttoned and compelling storytelling, fine characterization, brilliant voice acting, and very well-done, crisp animation. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is full of action - engaging you virtually from the beginning - but it pulls back by presenting you what you don't expect: A son - \"Hiccup\" - of a Viking leader who is more book- and mechanically-smart than brawn. An engineer, a tinkerer, a genius in his own right. And, clearly, he's not destined to be a Leif Ericson. Whether through happenstance, skill, or fate - you decide - Hiccup captures an \"uncatchable\" dragon, the Night Fury, with a smart little contraption he cooked up. In the process of catching it he goofs the entire effort of the village to fight the swarms of dragons. Running off later, he finds the Night Fury, who it turns out was injured by his contraption. Lacking a full rudder - so to speak - He can't take to the sky completely. Hiccup cooks up another contraption that helps him fix the rudder and allows him to ride the Night Fury - now affectionately named \"Toothless.\" Simultaneously he is going through \"Dragon Training\" where he is learning how to kill dragons, but ironically what he is learning from Toothless allows him to best his classmates by learning all sorts of secret moves on the captured dragons they train with - all of which allow him to effectively disable them without hurting them. Hiccup ends up being the village celebrity who can seemingly dominate the dragons without really trying to. Coming home from a quest to find the Dragons' nest, Hiccup's father, a well-voiced Gerard Butler as Stoick, is beside himself with joy at how well his son is doing. The story moves on from there from one exciting scene to the next, to the climax, where they battle the biggest dragon of them all. I won't give the ending away but it's only slightly bittersweet - mostly poignant and not-too-nicely wrapped-up for popular consumption. Suffice it to say even in a war with fictional beasties there is a price to be paid. In the end, Hiccup comes out shining. This really is a great, fun, engaging story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is not fluffy or silly-for-silly's sake (as, say, the \"Shrek\" series has mostly become). And, even though the action is fairly intense, your kids will very likely love it. It really is a fun, fun story. Don't miss it.", "My partner and myself both had the same feeling within the first five minutes of this movie starting.....this is going to be bad. Quite dark, loads going on, narration that you couldn't quite hear......then bang!!!!! It properly gets going. In brief, Hiccup is a young Viking who doesn't live up to the Dragon Slaying heights that his father would like. Every time he tries, he causes complete mayhem. That is until he meets Toothless, a very rare species of dragon that has never been seen before. This incident would have brought Hiccup the fame and glory that his father so desperately wants his son to have, but instead of wanting to slay and kill the dragon, Hiccup befriends him and finds that all dragons are not what they first seem. What unfolds is a fantastic story of friendship, bravery and courage, and all of this is delivered to your multiplex in absolutely jaw dropping animation and 3D rendering. And I mean jaw dropping. The Viking ships cutting through the water, the clouds, the amazing flying scenes....just fantastic. I was a huge fan of Pixars UP, a beautiful picture brought to you wrapped in beautiful animation, but I must admit that, for the first time in my opinion, a Dreamworks animated movie more than holds its own against its superior counterpart. Dreamworks have well and truly cracked it with this movie and if they keep with this formula, then their success will be going long into the future. Now I know that thousands out there will be screaming in Shreks favour but lets be honest, Shrek was mediocre at best and it sequels just milked an already shaky beginning dry. How To Train Your Dragon is by far Dreamworks best animated movie, and also one of the best animated movies made to date. A total success.", "It's not like it's a particularly new idea: Lad seeks to find his place in society, intuitively makes a decision that breaks with tradition, becomes a pariah, succeeds in transcending tradition and then bringing his society into a new paradigm. An old story idea, told a million times. But in spite of the underlying staid character of the premise, this movie manages to work. I had no problem following Hiccup along on his little adventure. You revel in his truly becoming, not just a man, but a new kind of man, and a real leader. I dug it. I particularly enjoyed that, in the end, Hiccup did have to pay a price for his daring (won't spoil that). But he does bring the story to a heroic conclusion that I could get behind. It surprised me in that way! Good writing, good voice work, nice pacing and scenario work. Very well animated. I dug it! I hope we all can learn something about heroism from Hiccup.", "How to Train Your Dragon directed by Chris Sanders & Dean DeBlois is a big budget CGI animation film from the DreanWorks Animation stable.  The story is set around the ancient & mythical Viking land where the glory of a man lies in becoming a dragon slayer. Dragons occasionally raid the Vikings & take the livestock & any other available food which invariably results in a fight. The protagonist of the movie is Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), son of the chief of Vikings (Gerard Butler). As with any other Viking, Hiccup wants to be a dragon slayer but is constantly discouraged by his father because he is 'different' read not muscular. So at one of the dragon raids, when Hiccup injures a most feared dragon called Night Fury, no one believes him. He goes to the adjacent woods to find & kill it, but when the time comes he couldn't do it because he realizes that it is as much afraid of him as he is of it. So he releases it & an unlikely friendship is forged. Gradually Hiccup finds that dragons are not harmful unless provoked & he tries to change the perceptions of Vikings especially that of his father. With the help of his lady love Astrid (America Ferrera), how he achieves his goal & brings peace between Vikings & Dragons forms the rest of the story. By the way, the intro of Astrid is hot, literally. There are enough action pieces & fights with a lot of . The Big Daddy at the climax looked like a hybrid between T-Rex & Archaeopteryx. Imagine a T-Rex breathing fire.  The basic structure of the story is not at all new. In fact after watching the movie, you would feel that you seen this kind of a story a 100 times where a misunderstood teenager/kid meets a misunderstood character/animal - they become friends - with the help of allies they make a difference in their surroundings - you know it. So what differentiates such movies? The characters & the settings which are new in \"How to Train Your Dragon\" & what more, they are beautiful. The tale is touching with enough thrills to keep you engaging although in the middle, for a few minutes, you feel that the pace has slowed a bit. As far as animation goes, the level of detail is unbelievable. In fact if there are no animated characters in the movie, you would think that the movie is not animated at all. The shadows & the colours are superb adding amazing depth to the animation. Since it's entrance, Pixar has been walking with major revenues as well as acclaim leaving Dreamworks in its trail. With only Toy Story from Pixar in 2010, this got to be one of the leading contenders at the Oscars 2011. Already this has got the highest score for a Dreamworks Animation film at Rotten Tomatoes. Come on DreamWorks, we need some good competition to Pixar. Bring more movies like this. All the voice cast is good. I think Gerard Butler is a Viking in his previous birth as his voice somehow suits it well. John Powell's score complements the movie well. Technically a very well made film. If you are one of those, who felt cheated after watching the 3D versions of Alice in Wonderland & Clash of the Titans, this movie will not disappoint you. I've mentioned in my Clash of the Titans review to not see it in 3D, but How to Train Your Dragon is a movie which you should see in 3D. The movie is also being screened in 2D version but there is no point in seeing this in 2D. Although the 3D is not as superlative as say Avatar, this has some cool scenes & definitely ranks in my all time top 5 3D animation films. If you have kids or you want to impress kids, take them to the movie & wouldn't regret your decision. They would absolutely love this. In fact I would say this is the best family movie this summer I actually beg you to take your kids to \"How to Train Your Dragon\" if you haven't already done so. Since I'm stressing on kids, don't think that this is not for adults. If you have a kid some where in you, you would enjoy this. Love to hear what you thought about the movie or my review, http://amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/", "I have a friend in the area who lost his hand in a wood chipper a little over a year ago. His recovery and return to life have been nothing short of miraculous. A determined will, a strong faith in God, an incredibly supportive wife, encouraging friends and family created the perfect environment for him to recover and eventually become functional with a prosthetic. Just a year later and he is back at work as a doctor, has played golf, returned to biking, and enjoys a host of other activities that he did prior to the accident. However, the first time I was around him with his new hand was slightly jarring for me. I was surprised, but I could not remember a time in which I was around someone with a prosthetic. Fortunately, my friend appears comfortable with his new hand and understands that it takes a period of time for others to get used to it. His goal is to move to a new hand within the next year that has the dexterity to pick up a quarter. Knowing him and his support group, I'm sure he'll make the adjustment just fine. Unfortunately, most pictures of prostheses in movies and books are not so positive. From Capt. Hook to Candyman to the Fugitive, rarely are amputees seen in a positive light. There are a few inspirational movies here and there but the stereotype remains. That was why I was so surprised when I took my family to see \"How to Train Your Dragon.\" The movie has not one but three characters with prosthesis and all are portrayed in a positive light. The way the creators do that is by presenting the characters as leading normal lives. Each finds a way to make life work with their new hands, feet, and wings. Each shows a wonderfully determined attitude to continue despite their setback. Each finds a way to be happy. Granted, I'm sure folks with prosthetics go through a variety of emotions that I can not fathom. I'm also sure that not everyone's experience turns out as well as my friend's or the characters' in the movie. But I do think it is important to show positive pictures of folks with prosthetics that seek to lessen people's fears and inspire others. Aside from being an entertaining movie, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" does just that. Full review found at the Raleigh Examiner http://bit.ly/cNbRE1", "This film was brilliant, i enjoyed it more than up and wall-e!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The animation is brilliant, and the 3D takes you into another world, the ending *SPOILERS* IS CRACKING WHEN HICCUP LOSES YOU KNOW wot i just thought it was such a good ending, instead of hes alive- i love u guys so much etc, its like there was a price to pay. The dragons were thought out so well, and toothless was made out in such a different way, and i loved the way they portrayed him, apparently it doesn't change the book that much, and still keeps the heart of it at least, unlike others, this is definitely the best film to come out of dream works, no sequel needed. Just a shame that the next film is Shrek 4 which will probably be bad, and how to train your dragon will probably be overpowered by shrek 4 and dream works will be remembered as taking shrek too far instead of letting this little masterpiece get through:)", "Its no Kung-fu Panda, but How to Train Your Dragon does what it sets out to do and some more. The brief intro to the Vikings is reminiscent of my favourite Gaulish village and did bring out a grin. The main character is Hiccup a misfit viking, who is also (unfortunately for him) the Chief's son. Born with a significant lack of brawn as far as his peers go; the young man pursues his goal of slaying a dragon with a single minded dedication which mostly lands him in several interesting situations. The boy finally does bag a fabled dragon but can't seem to find it in his heart to kill the beautiful creature so he ends up freeing him. Thus begins the symbiotic relation ship between the man and beast as they find common grounds and ultimately become friends. The story is fairly predictable from here on however Sanders and DeBlios handle it extremely well and about a half hour into the movie have you eating out of their hands. The visuals are great especially the flying sequences which are brilliantly shot and they end up conveying the energy and adrenalin rush to the viewer. The big baddie dragon is the perfect villain though this angle could have been delved into a tad more. Regardless of this the movie is one of the best animation movies to come out in a few years and is definitely worth a watch with the family. No matter how old you are you will want your own dragon by the end of it.", "I watched the IMAX 3D version of this movie yesterday, and all I can say this was the best 3D movie to date(yes even better than Avatar). This movie is a must see at the theater in 3D, plus the story is very entertaining which definitely makes a worthwhile movie experience(and at $16 dollars for the movie ticket that was no easy task). The computer animation was done very well for this movie and you get to see the impressive effects right from the beginning of the movie. They show where the Vikings live from the ocean view and the ocean almost looks lifelike and with the 3D effect it looks like you are right there on the water. Pixar movies(which I am a fan of all of them) may have its work cut out for them on winning the Oscar for animated movie of the year with Toy Story 3, because at this point this is the best movie I have seen this year.", "When I saw the commercial and trailers on TV, there was no way i was going to watch this. They commercials made this movie look so cheesy, vikings and dragons... So i went on IMDb to check the score, and it got an average of 8, so I gave this movie a chance. Having said that other animations that got good ratings, i didn't like at all. I must say its hard to make a animation for kids and adults, but my child seemed to enjoy this movie, one of her favorites she said. There were vikings in this movie, which I really didn't want to see, but it turned out o.k. They didn't bother me much because most of the movie is focused on the dragon and the boy. What I liked most about this movie was the 3D effects. It really added to the movie. What this movie did was not make stuff pop out at you, it made the background really visually stunning. Its like looking through a window in a house, you can see depths to picture. If you are not willing to pay a few bucks for 3D then its not worth it. Storyline was OK, you get a feel for the boy and the dragon, so i feel that it completed its goal.", "As most school children know,the Vikings were originally from Scotland, and spoke fluent English,with a dense Scottish accent. That bit of beefing aside,'How To Train Your Dragon' is a fun time at the cinema. The plot:Hiccup is a young Viking lad who wants to hunt & kill a dragon, just like his brave Father,Stoick. Problem is that Hiccup is something of a screw up who just can't get things straight. One day when the village is being attacked by a horde of dragons,Hiccup manages to land one with a crude sling shot like device. When Hiccup goes to claim his prize (and try,one and for all to impress his dad),he finds out that dragons aren't as evil as they are made out to be. This causes Hiccup to do a radical re-think of dragons & study their movements. In the interim of all of this,Hiccup manages to form a bond of friendship with the dragon (which he even assigns a name:Toothless),all the while he is in training on how to kill a dragon with the other youngsters in the village (under Gobber's tutorial). It's now up to Hiccup to try & go on a one man (boy?)campaign to change the Viking's anti dragon bias. Dean DeBlois (Lilo & Stitch,Heima)& Chris Sanders (also Lilo & Stitch,both the feature film,as well as the television series)co direct,from a screenplay by DeBlois,from the best selling novel by Cressida Cowell. As this is an animated 3D-CGI feature film (released in both digital 3-D,standard 3-D,as well as flat 2-D formats),the voice talent include Jay Baruchel as Hiccup,Gerard Butler ('Rocknrolla','300',and most recently in 'The Bounty Hunter')as Hiccup's father,Stoick,Craig Ferguson ('The Late,Late Show With Craig Ferguson')as Stoick's best friend,Gobber,America Ferrera ('Ugly Betty') as Astrid,Hiccup's adversary,with Jonah Hill,T.J.Miller,Kristen Wiig, Kieron Elliot & Ashley Jensen. This is fast moving fun for one & all. Rated PG by the MPAA,for some intense sequences that may frighten the very young & a bit of rude humour.", "Note: I marked this as spoilers because this is going to ruin your opinion on it if you haven't seen it yet. This movie was horrible for several reasons: 1. The characters were SO annoying! Their faces disgusted me, and their body structure--ugh. Don't even get me started on their body structure! There bodies are fat and plump, but their legs are as skinny as sticks! Plus, they acted so annoying I wished that at some point, a giant dragon would eat them all up, then a happy song comes on (\"Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows\" from the Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs soundtrack would work perfectly), the movie ends, and my oldest sister (who took me to see the movie in the first place) gets her money back, which she uses to buy us ice cream. That however, would never happen in a PG-rated movie. 2. The plot. It stunk. At some points, the plot got so boring, I daydreamed, but after about fifteen minutes, I remember that I'm supposed to watch this movie. At some points, I tried to make myself fall asleep, while at other points, I got so confused that I wished I had those cupcake shaped, frosting flavored mints I always wanted, so I can refresh my memory. Also, nearly every aspect of the movie was copied from another movie. And seriously--they didn't need Astrid and Hiccup to be in love. The producers just thought that to make the movie more popular, they should just have some sort of love story in there. The plot could have still been all right without that! I've always longed for a new kids' movie without any love story. 3. The dialog. The jokes in the movie were NOT funny, and the characters' voices must have been distorted from eating all that roasted dragon meat. I have no idea why my sisters liked it. In my opinion, it stunk. 3/10, but the animation deserves a 9/10.", "this film is just awful... this could be easily the worst movie i've ever saw!! i can't understand how this film is best quoted then cars or the lion king. my only explanation is that thousands of four,five year old kids asked their parents to come and vote perfect to IMDb. Open your eyes! if you didn't saw this film, you haven't lost anything because this film doesn't teach kids to have values, it only satisfies small girls who believe in santa claus and in the future they will end up with their prince charming. there are so many kids movie who deserve better quotation then this awful movie. Camon IMDb change the quotation of this film", "I wasn't expecting a kid movie, and I didn't get one. Granted, this movie is kid-friendly, but it has enough substance in the story that it doesn't get weighed down with mind-altering attempts at comic relief. The story is enough without any inanities. Hiccup is about as non-Viking as a Viking can be, and of course, his dad is the chief of the island, and the biggest, most Vikingest Viking that a Viking can be. He tries to use his skills to fit in and impress his dad, but his skills aren't physical. He's more of a thinker and a problem solver. When he befriends one of the most legendary dragons, which no one else has even seen, he begins to see into the nature of the dragons and how to deal with them. It isn't easy to convince the Vikings of this, but the circumstances of the story eventually take care of that problem. The \"chemistry\" between Hiccup and the dragon Toothless is amazing considering that this is animation. All the characters are well-designed to bring out the characters, but Toothless is an impressive feat in his movements and his ability to convey emotions through expressions and body language throughout the movie. The action in this movie is pretty eye-popping, but some of the more understated scenes are pretty striking in their own ways, such as the fight in the clouds when the Vikings are simply observing flashes of light. For a warrior people who venerate Thor and Odin, such a scene must have been dramatic in a different way. Comic relief is here in the form of some of Hiccup's peers, and while they may have had more character in the book, they seem to be kind of sporadic in their scenes here. As a compliment, at last they aren't overused meddling goofups filling in for plot points with contrivances, as you might see in lesser movies. They definitely have character, even if it doesn't have a chance to show. The story stays focused and gets where it needs to be by the end. Overall, all the elements in this movie make it worth seeing. I'd even be up for a second viewing.", "You can't really say you've seen a bad movie until you watch this one. Basically the story goes like this Hiccup, the awkward son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, whom he looks and acts nothing like, dreams of killing a Night Furry, which is said to be impossible. When he actually does, no one believes him. He is too much of a pussy to kill it, so he trains and befriends it. He suddenly learns to train other dragons which other people think he is really tormenting, which makes him a hero. Not everything about this movie is dreadful, the animation is pretty good, but the idea of vikings going against everything they know and domesticating dragons is both blasphemous and dull. It contains lames jokes that are extremely dry. Basically, you will hate this movie, with the notable exception if you are a pasty-face nerd who wears glasses and spends his free time playing world of Warcraft. When it first came out it received positive reviews for some reason, but like most over-rated movies it will be forgot about in a few years.", "'How To Train Your Dragon' is an average fare. Though most of the people loved it and made a super-hit , I personally believe, this animation flick lacks a solid script. 'How To Train Your Dragon' is set in a mythical Viking world where a young Viking teenager aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at finally gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer has the desire to kill it. The idea is interesting, and the animation is heavenly. Where this flick falters, is it's writing, which is too predictable after a point. The final 40-minutes are been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff. It had the potential of becoming a terrific film, but for me, it came out as an average watch. The characters are wonderfully voiced. Jay Baruchel in the lead role, brings in various emotions to his character, while Gerard Butler, voices wonderfully as the lead Viking. On the whole, I have grown up watching Masterstorkes like 'The Lion King' and 'Beauty And The Beast' , I carry loads of expectations from Cartoon-Animated Cinema, and so why, I was disappointed by this one, thanks to the predictable script. Watch it if you must!", "This movie has so much going for it that I'm almost ashamed I didn't like it more. As is nearly always the case these days, the animation is splendid. Add to that, mostly plausible, if rather routine, characters, good voice acting, and excellent music and you're on to a winner. Well, almost. Unfortunately, the story, while very pleasant, is pure template (boy befriends cute animal he should be killing and wins over skeptical father and friends - puh-lease!) and the climactic battle scene goes on way too long. But I'm smiling as I write this, which can't be bad - can it?  Rating: 6/10.", "I went to see this movie (In 3D) with my family which consists of my parents me and my two younger siblings. And if I should boil the review down to one word I would choose this word: Success! If you - like me - worship \"Madagascar\" and \"Shrek\" this movie is a must. But... \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is unfortunately too focused on the 3D-effects, so some of the other elements of the movie is not as well- made as they could've been. But, I guess it's unavoidable as these effects are so \"new\" (of course not new, but you know what I mean). The creators are so excited about this new level of storytelling that they focus too much on this part and leave others behind. The story is classic, and not as funny as some of Dreamworks previous movies. It works fine, but it still pulls down my vote since it only functions as a frame instead of the center of the movie. But having said that I need to tell you: \"How to Train Your Dragon\" will still be worth watching. My youngest sibling doesn't understand English, so I won't be able to tell you about the Voice-acting for the original language, but if any Danes wanna know, the Danish-dubbed voices works good (Compared to other dubbed movies). The main character's voice is a bit weird, but won't disturb you. The animations are done in the classic Dreamworks-style. It works nicely, since the caricature-like faces works good to express feelings. Summed up this movie is a must for any sane family. If you're going to watch it remember to enjoy the little bits, cause that is what's in focus.", "I like cartoons. Like many US creations it's a morality play. At time the moral element is a bit too prominent for my taste, but I suppose it's standard for the US. The moral is partly shared with Avatar and Sesame St - don't fear/hate difference. Sometimes people behave badly because they are driven by circumstances, sometimes we fight because it's all we've known, and so on. Unlike Tolkien I'm not totally opposed to allegory and there are clear parallels to the wars currently being waged by the US and Europe in the Middle East. Let's hope many warmongering politicians everywhere go to see this movie and see how stupid they are. Actually the more I think of it, the more I realise that the Dragons represent Middle Eastern peoples (including the Afghans); and the Vikings, America. Though I suppose if I were an Iraqi peasant I might see the other way around! The big dragon is either Sadam Hussein, Tony Blair, or George Bush depending on where you live - a hungry beast driving minions on to evil acts. The one that everyone obeys because they are too frightened not to. Also adults in this film, as in most films these days, are pretty stupid and it's the kids that figure out how to save the situation. Yay for them! I read this as part of the continuing aftershock of two world wars which showed that authority figures are not to be trusted. And this leaves us in a dilemma: we don't trust or respect authority (because it betrayed our grandparents) and so there is a breakdown in authority and responsibility. But then they all live happily ever after, even the dragons, once everyone listens to the kids and their fresh perspective. I was puzzled by why the grown up Vikings all have Scottish accents while the children have US accents.", "I loved the movie, but the 3D was not worth it. First the movie. I thought it was a very touching movie. A young boy who wants to prove himself as a viking, but he is kind of screw up that is always an embarrassment to his father. I think anyone who has had a beloved pet will love this movie. The bond Hiccup forms with the dragon is very sweet. The supporting characters are nothing special. I love Kristen Wiig, but her character is so lame that anyone could have voiced the part. Craig Ferguson is the only standout in his role. Now for the 3D. There is only one flying scene in the movie that had me go \"Wow!\", but the rest of the movie did not benefit from the 3D. If I am going to pay that much extra for a ticket, I want to be amazed throughout the movie. Maybe it is the technology, or the theater, or the particular pair of glasses I wore. I thought the scenes appeared mostly out of focus. My glasses kept picking up on the glare from the Exit signs and the aisle lighting. I saw it at a quality theater. Not worth the extra cost.", "I first heard of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" around the time that it got released but didn't get around to seeing it until now. The movie itself has a plot that's similar to other movies that I've seen - the main character befriends a supposed enemy and eventually helps everyone understand that friendship is better than enmity - but I thought that as a movie it wasn't half bad. I particularly liked how Astrid has a tough side. As for the animation, I don't really pay attention to that. In my opinion, it's not the look that matters, it's the plot. And this movie doesn't have the most original plot, but still an interesting one. It's worth seeing. And props to the recently deceased Tom Petty, whose song title I parodied with the title of my review. I also just saw Jay Roach's \"Recount\" (about the 2000 US presidential election), which featured Petty's most famous song during the end credits.", "How to Train Your Dragon is more than a pleasant experience. Its got a lot of colour and a fairly decent adventure. However, it all falls apart by being completely derivative and therefore extremely predictable. The dragon training from Avatar, the inventive non-conforming protagonist from A Bug's Life, the intercultural communication from Monster's Inc., the Gerard Butler character from 300 - How to Train Your Dragon might just be the least original film to come out in the last five years. As for predictability, the film follows the least twisted narrative ever. Everything from Hiccup's father's changing attitude towards his son to the twin friends being paired with the two-headed dragon can be seen coming from a mile away. The predictable script is also a reason I never engaged with Hiccup as a character. Many, if not all of his decisions throughout the movie are not based on a believable character, but are based on allowing the story to proceed. No boy would ever choose to face a dragon before the whole village than tell his father about a dragon. How to Train Your Dragon is also a case and point example of where animated films could benefit from being targeted at older crowds and therefore made less kid-friendly. For a premise that hinges on a thousand year war between humans and dragons, to show not one death in the entire film is rather nasal. I would almost give the film kudos for Hiccup's final fate, but by that point I was so sick of it that I didn't care. An extremely overrated film, its a pleasant experience but put it low on your list to see.", "A movie that is good fun and yet has some clich\u00e9d stuff that makes it more predictable. One would easily fall into the movie because it has every slot of a very entreating and moreover an animated movie. It has action, drama adventure romance and even humour. It's a story of a dragon and a boy understanding their language and vice-versa that is the dragon understanding the boy's language. But how come the dragons understand whatever each one speaks in yet to be deciphered by me coz I did not get that point.  Also, this film has some breath taking visuals that are tailor made for the 3D effects and to ensure that what 3D is about is known to the viewer. Look at those dragon rides in the sky. These were taken from Avatar if I have to believe so. The visual affects are for sure great and some scenes are written well too. But overall there is something that this movie lacks and that is a heart. It did not make me go for that boy called \"Hiccup\" to do what he wants to do. Neither did it make me feel for the dragon who has got one wing only and flies with the help of an artificial wing made by Hiccup. It is a movie that is good and surely and assuringly entertaining it brings laughs and makes us woo to sometime but such laughs are few and far in between. The kids have liked it as I saw in theatre way back in 2010 and even yesterday, my sister loved it and I did not like it enough, maybe I need more of a fluidity than the commercial rigidity.  I would go a 3/5 for a surely entertaining and good animated feature but it missed the point of flowing and thus stuck with what the kids would like more than what the story is about.", "Better than most Pixar's films and perhaps the best film that Dreamworks ever made, it is a high quality family entertainment that sometimes has the feeling of a video game and other times uses common plot clich\u00e9s to advance the story. To small kids unfamiliar with older films this picture would appear excellent but to someone expecting some innovative creativity this film fails. It is a very well executed clich\u00e9 film. Very good for kids and parents who don't know much about films. For something truly extraordinary in terms of family oriented animation, well, watch My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. But it doesn't work very well for someone who has more experience watching films. Feels similar to the 2012 Batman film (Dark Knight Rises) in these terms.", "Before I registered, I used to read the reviews on every movie I'd watch and I'd based my opinion on the love/hate factor. One thing I would read often is how Pixar had better plots, and Dreamworks had very cool animation. Well, Pixar's plots and Dreamworks animation combined to create this movie, it seems. Maybe it's because I watched it with three of my best friends on my birthday, but I thought this movie was extra cool. The animation in 3d was very cool. Nothing beats that. Then the plot, with a typical rejected kid my age who is trying to impress his father. The kid realizes something no one else does, and the 'cute girl' character shows that interest in the reject. At the end he gets two kisses from her (where are the hugs these days?) and we are all happy. And yes, I cried when I watched the ending. The power of emotions was at hand. Good job dreamworks. Make How to Train your Dragon 2 just as cool. :)", "How to Train Your Dragon 3D (Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, 2010) is a spirited animation that puts a smart spin on a familiar story. A sensitive, apparently weedy teenager struggles to escape the shadow of his overbearing father - a dragon fighter. After the youngster shoots down a dragon, he's crestfallen that no-one believes his story, and sets out to find the beast. What he finds instead is a friend - the inaccurately-named Toothless - their relationship giving him the insider knowledge needed to mollify the monsters he faces in Dragon Training. The film shares something of its sensibility with Dick King Smith's comic novel Tumbleweed, while the fine premise is augmented by action sequences and anarchic humour in the manner of a Pixar film. While this can't touch Up or WALL-E, it's a distinguished take on the 'boy and his pet' yarn with a vivid backdrop, appealing characters (they may be stereotypes, but they seem real) and good jokes. And there's imagination to spare in the production design, which includes some memorable monsters - the main baddie being a particularly formidable chap. Though it's all CGI, it looks lovingly crafted, with a distinctive visual style. As Hiccup, Jay Baruchel is occasionally too old and studied, but the voice cast is mostly good, handling the chatty material well and proffering a multitude of energetic whoops and yells. Those cries, of course, are lent to the action set-pieces, which possess a genuine sense of magic. The scene in which Hiccup takes Toothless out of a tailspin is absolutely euphoric - a real gem. As for 3D, it's not really 3D, it's 2D objects in front of one another, but it works nicely here, particularly when it's subtly employed to draw us into the centre of the drama.", "this is not the movie I will have fond memories of. The movie is good, no doubt, but it did not click with me. I felt that the dragons were depicted as misunderstood dogs. Their mannerisms felt like those of cute dogs, especially toothless. He is so cute, he could as well have been a puppy. Also, I would have liked the ending to be more creative. I guess the premise was unique, so I thought they could have done a lot more with it. OK, Enough whining. As a kid movie, this is fun. The things that I did not like will probably endear it to the kids and the box-office numbers reflect that. The animation is top class. Witty dialogues. Nice music. All I am saying is, I just wouldn't put it in my top 250.", "At first glance from commercials and trailers, it's just another one of \"those\" movies that have been coming out a lot recently for kids/families. Crude humor, clich\u00e9 story, cheesy dialogue, waste of money (movie tickets are insanely expensive today). So this movie was not even on my radar until my friends saw it and said it was cute, so on a free weekend, I saw it, but the 2D version, just in case it wasn't worth the money. I was SO wrong. Within the first couple of minutes, I was hooked and convinced and entertained the entire film, and I have since seen the movie 4 times (Quite honestly, I've never seen anything more than 3 times while it's still in theaters). I laugh, I cry, and the turning point of the film still makes my heart pound. It is a true gem. The use of 3D is exemplary, unlike Avatar, which did absolutely nothing for the already dazzling 2D picture, except give James Cameron more cash than he already had. The flying scenes in How to Train Your Dragon are absolutely amazing and beautiful, seeing this in 3D is a MUST. While a lot of visually amazing movies fall short on everything else, this movie did not. I fell in love with each character, and while the story was cute, imaginative, and touching, it was NEVER cheesy or corny or made me cringe. The script is fantastic, and sometimes even very mature and smart, but not chatty. I can't even BEGIN to tell you about the music, but it is incredible and just as inspirational as the film itself. Some have said the characters and plot are clich\u00e9, but quite honestly, because it's a MOVIE, a lot of elements are predictable. It's just the way things are. My favorite touch of originality has to be the fact that the leading heroine, Astrid, is smart, strong, independent, tough yet sweet on the inside, and ISN'T brunette; she's BLONDE! Being a blonde myself and quite offended by the way we are in the media, this made me extremely happy, and if I already didn't love the movie enough, I love it even more for that. On a final note, I strongly wish this will win best animated picture for the next Oscars, because it truly deserves it. Not many movies stick with me for so long or make me emotionally attached to them, like I am right now. Bravo, Dreamworks.", "I never really think too much about symbolism in films, but I am sure 'how to train your dragon' has a few life affirming messages. It is an animated story that follows the story of Hiccup who is a fairly weedy young viking. His father is the head of the village who are fighting Dragons who regularly come and plunder the village. Hiccup performs terribly during the Dragon attacks, but manages to score a lucky hit on the most fearsome Night Fury dragon which he sees land in a nearby jungle. He goes off to finish off the dragon the next day and gain some credibility within the village, but ends up befriending it. The story moves on from here and is very enjoyable. It isn't too long and there isn't any baggy bits. Very enjoyable.", "Jay Baruchel has a great voice for acting. It's a voice that sounds awkward and you just can throw a lot of jokes at him and continuously get a laugh. He's got a sound to him like no one I've ever heard before. As Hiccup, he plays an endearing and lovable character and you just can't help but feel him to be realistic and wish he were real. I knew right from the get-go that Stoick was the voice of Gerard Butler because I kept hearing his accent from 300 when he played King Leonidas. I'm not opposed to it, but it was weird to compare the Scottish accent from Craig Ferguson (as Gobber) to Gerard's. Mainly, they play vikings from the same town. After confronting Toothless, the dragon, with a fish to bond, this movie turns into a sweet, cute tale about friendship between a boy and a dragon. I can see some similarities between this and Dragonheart, but it's slightly different. It's touching at times and just right-out hilarious most of the time. As the chemistry between Toothless and Hiccup grows, Astrid, begins to take notice and she begins to like Hiccup. I enjoyed every part of the story and each scene, either full of drama, comedy or action, was incredibly exhilarating. I cried for a minute during one scene and couldn't help but falling in love with all the characters. They are all written so tremendously. It's a great family film for all and I recommend everyone see it.", "I wasn't too keen on seeing this movie as I don't usually enjoy animated kid movies, in fact I only saw it as a result of boredom, but what a surprise it turned out to be! It is one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen, I loved every minute of it. From the beginning it grabs your attention and it continues doing so until the very end. In my opinion this movie is perfect, there isn't one single thing I didn't like about it. It is visually stunning, the story plot is amazing and the characters are cute and funny and I am in love with that dragon! I definitely recommend you seeing this movie, you won't regret it. It is one the best movies I have ever watched and surely the best animation film there is.", "This was such a great movie!! The animation was amazing and the characters were all very real!! I was so impressed!! The dragon's in this movie were just out of this world. The funniest dragon was this gross looking INSECT WINGED dragon which reminded me of Watto from Star Wars - The Phantom Menace. The coolest dragon was of course Toothless. However, I could have chosen a better name for him. This is just a feel good movie about family, courage and fitting in. There were a few moments in the movie where tears welled in my eyes! I was surprised to see that Jonah Hill was doing one of the voices (I thought it was Jack Black at first). One of the best parts of the movie was when the dragon trainer hammered a rock into his gums as a tooth. Great movie. All mighty Thor approve of this movie!! Move over Shrek - HICCUP is in town!!!!", "I have to give this film 10 out of 10, it encompassed everything required for a great family film, so much so that my 7 year old son and I have been to see it twice! He normally has the attention span of a nat when it comes to watching films, however, with this one he watched it from start to finish with a big smile on his face, as did I. The scene where the dragon lets Hiccup reach out and touch him for the first time was purely magical, a scene that will touch the heart of any that watch it, as will most of the film. A fantastic film for the whole family, if you haven't seen it you're missing out.", "I am a twenty two year old male. Animated features are not my usual movie-going preference, but my girlfriend sometimes drags me to them. Some like Up and this movie How to Train your Dragon were very enjoyable for me. The basic story of this movie is a young boy, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), lives in a town of Vikings. His father (Gerard Butler) is the town leader. The town is in a constant state of readiness to fend of the attacking dragons. They fear them, train for them, and try to fight them. Hiccup is different than all the other Vikings, fighting and killing is not his way. In the movie he catches the dreaded Night Fury dragon only to find out how friendly they can be. The movie is full of action, the 3-D was seamlessly added in, and it is a great story of father-son love and developing friendships that people of all ages can relate to. It is funny and entertaining throughout and I would give a recommendation to anyone to go watch it. 8 out of 10.", "I saw the trailer, and my mind was telling me \"Another boring kids animation, with toilet humour\". But I am so happy that I was wrong. Just because animation was about dragons and also because of my curiosity I went to see it. From beginning to the end I was drawn in the movie. There is no word in my mind to describe how awesome this movie was. The story it self was great. The end of the animation was something I did not expected, something normally you won't see in animated movie. And John Powell did excellent work making music for this movie. The story, effects, characters, 3D and music made this movie perfect. Pure Masterpiece!!! I recommend for everyone to see this animated movie. I am 21 year old an I have seen it 3 times. The best animated movie -> 10/10", "This movie was very very good, in my opinion. Even though the story is a little predictable, it is still an amazing movie. The Characters are likable, the cgi is amazing, and the voice acting is very very good. I saw this with my little sister and brother, and we all loved it. This movie has a great message, and I hope you all go to see this too. Its a great movie. In my opinion, the message of the movie is about trying to see things a different way. Like, to explore and delve. For example, wolves are very unwelcome here in the US, but we need them. So of course people try to hunt them, but there are organizations out there that are trying to put an end to this wolf killing as they ARE actually vital to our environment. Then again, this is my two cents and what I think. Everyone has their own opinion.", "~WARNING, THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!~  I saw this movie's trailer, and I have to admit that it seemed to come off as just another regular, formulaic, animated movie in order to get a cheap laugh, using fart jokes and toilet references as a foundation for the plot. But that's not how the movie was AT ALL when I saw it in theaters! The plot was not very formulaic (if it was at all), there was plenty of suspense, there was some unexpected parts that gave it more character than other movies like this, the acting by the star-studded cast was flawless, and the animation was superb! This is definitely up there as one of the best animated films of 2010! So take the kids to see it, but if you happen to miss it, you should absolutely buy it because not only will it captivate the children, but it will most-likely captivate you as well! I give this film a 9/10!", "And I mean that in every way, not just the visuals. When I saw the first commercial for HTTYD, I was completely uninterested. I looked it and thought, \"Oh, a silly kid movie about dragons.\" And though I love the mythical creature of the dragon, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. But I kept on hearing that it was such a good movie. Eventually, I wanted to see why it was so good. So I did. And I loved it. I loved it so much that I went and watched it two more times. Sure it has the occasional goof, and looking on it now the story isn't original... but this is a movie that really speaks to you - no matter what age you are. It can entertain a small child and an adult, and someone like me who is in that awkward stage of not wanting to grow up yet has already grown up. Jay Baruchel did an awesome job as Hiccup. I loved that the character was snarky, and Baruchel caught it well. And while vikings aren't Scottish, Gerard Butler plays Stoick just... just great. One of my favorite lines of the movie is actually the scene where Hiccup does an impression of Stoick (and a very good one I might add). The artwork and designs are just fantastic. So much so that I've actually ordered the art book. We have a colorful range of both different kinds of dragons and different vikings, some of which are downright funny looking to eye-popping. And the music... the music is just plain wonderful! I love listening to the soundtrack. While the soundtrack isn't \"epic movie\" scale, it's terribly enjoyable to listen to. I can keep talk about great this movie is, but I think I'll end this long review now. I just have to say one more thing: Toothless is the coolest dragon since Draco of Dragon Heart.", "Ah, jeez. Why did they have to make the dragons so darn CUTE under that scary, scaly, toothy exterior? So cute, in fact, that Toothless (a pitch-dark dragon called a Night Furie), the dragon our hapless (and unfortunately named) hero Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) befriends, reminded me of a cat I used to own (she was also pitch-dark, with a spot of white on her neck). Huh? Since when do dragons act like domesticated housecats when you get to know them? Ah, jeez. I suppose such questions are best left unpondered, since \"How to Train Your Dragon\" blends humor, pathos, and sometimes heart-melting tenderness with such grace and style that it had me shedding a tear or two by its conclusion. At its core, this is yet another allegory about not judging others by their differences, choosing your own path in life, and Doing The Right Thing (regardless of what others may think). The story is supported by colorful characters (dragon-killing vikings and their children), sharp writing that is by turns funny and truthful, and a fully fleshed-out world (including landscapes and a variety of colorful dragons that blend traits of both mammals and reptiles). The film is being marketed to capitalize on its 3D (which, admittedly, adds a few extra thrills to some scenes), but unlike \"Alice in Wonderland\" (so sorely lacking in pathos, style, and humor), \"Dragon\" is so strong on its own merits that the effect enhances the existing story, rather than becoming the sole reason for viewing.", "I went into this movie KNOWING, from reviews, that it would be great, but was I misinformed. It was INCREDIBLE! Action-Packed, great animation, story, characters, screenplay, funny in some parts, and emotional. Because of scary parts, i wouldn't recommend it to young kids, but to everyone else, SEE IT!!!!!!!!!! This may be my favorite animated movie of all time, or one of them. And YES, i was shedding some tears at the end. I hope to see it a few more times before it leaves theatres. Not NECESSARY to see it in 3D, just because 3d is SOOO expensive. You will get the same enjoyment seeing 2d!!!!!!!!!! I haven't seen the awards section of HTTYD but if it hasn't won any, it should. SEE IT", "I've now seen this about five times, so to me, it is a film that has a lot of replay value. Voice Acting: Despite the obvious starry cast, the majority of them delivered. I was pleasantly surprised by Butler, who actually made me cry after the climatic part when his voice wavered due to emotion. The rest are pretty good - Fergerson is genial as Gobber, Ferrera's defiant as the tough girl, Astrid. Only do I feel for, I guess, what's supposed to be young teens, casting twenty-somethings to voice them just sounds incongruous. There's the discrepancy between the Scottish accents of the adults and the American accents of the teens, but seeing as this is aimed a Western audience and is probably done for comedic effect, I can sort of understand it. Plot: It follows the underdog triumphing story in a pretty generic fashion but well, in that it gives the audience what they expect while throwing in a few unexpected and commendable surprises (especially Hiccup's outcome from the climax). So, baby steps as other countries are sometimes far darker with their family animation but at least progress is being made. There's occasional laughs (usually from a dryly humorous Hiccup: 'Thanks you for nothing, you useless reptile'), good dialogue and characterisation and essentially heart. I felt an emotional connection to Toothless. I have to say the flying scenes were exhilarating and genuinely made me believe that's near to what it would be like to fly a dragon. Animation: Very good. The aforementioned flying scenes are very good, the characters are brought successfully to life and the action really delivers. As far as the 3D goes, I still prefer 2D, but if you want 3D, by all means as the time spent has paid off. I just wish I didn't get a headache and watery eyes after watching it in 3D as I get the same soaring, excited feeling after watching it in 2D anyway. An earthy palette, cute and cartoony dragon design (Toothless looks intentionally like Stitch) and expressive eyes all make this really accessible and family friendly. Score: Powell's score is very fitting and memorable (the leitmotifs will be in my head for a long time). What can I add to what has already been said much more eloquently than myself? Coming Back Around, Forbidden Friendship, Romantic Flight and the end credits song Sticks and Stones by the lead singer from Icelandic band Siguar Ros (of Hoppipola fame as heard in the Planet Earth trailers) are my faves but everything is lovely. It's the epitome of a solid score. Overall: A Dreamworks film that doesn't feel like a Dreamworks film but more like the film Disney could've made (back in their 90s heyday). It does follow golden narrative rules, but it still offers surprises and is very engaging on an emotional level. The romance aspect could've been better developed and I'd loved to see more of life in Berk, being a Viking but for the wide audience it's aiming at and how it executes what it sets out to do, it accomplishes it pretty well. Easily best animated film of the year so far, unless Toy Story 3 has something even better up it's sleeve *fingers crossed* This marks a step in the right direction for animated films from Hollywood - 7.5/10", "I simply loved this movie, despite the cheesy looking dragons. It's a cute and simple story. Not that I like that sort of thing. Did you guys see that itty bitty pony, I want\u0085oh sorry. Right, the movie review. The art rendering was beautiful. Likable characters, the cast delivers there lines and feelings without fail. I had trouble remembering that I was hearing Gerard Butler not some big burly Viking named \"Stoick\" (As it should be.) It is a good movie for both young and old. I don't know why all the Vikings talked with a nondescript Gaelic accent, not a Scandinavian one. Which makes me say, 7 out of 10 for this one. Still loved it though.", "There aren't so many cartoons in which I enjoy and I didn't have some special wish to go watching this movie . Maybe I was so impressed with this 3D technology that my wish was stronger than me . I saw the trailer and I thought that it is something new . This movie took theme which is maybe never took in animated movies . I don't know what happened to authors of Madagascar and Shrek but I realized that this movie is great. With this trailer I thought that my wish for animated movies passed because I used to watch animated movies few years ago . There was only one thing which attracted me . Critics . There were excellent that I couldn't believe . I thought that everything is maybe some great mistake . But it isn't . The only which was bad was Croatian synchronization . Our synchronization is usually bad . I decided to go and check what is this .  At first sight this movie was humorous but like others . I was excited about this movie and I think that I am now fond of this movie . Everything was brilliant and 3D technology was perfect . Whole plot was very well connected and every part made this movie excellent . I haven't any minus for this movie . Becoming characters and visual masterpiece . This dragons really made me happy . No matter what theme was maybe unusual authors definitely made something superb . There were so many great parts like Night Fury-smart and becoming dragon . This whole movie maybe isn't so illuminating but it is showing us something what others aren't . This movie really gotta soul .  I liked many parts but the most part when Night Fury started to laugh and his becoming face and part when Hiccup is training him . Stoick was also great . Astrid was good . Even Croatian synchronization was good I am disappointed that I couldn't hear Jay Baruchel and Gerard Butler . Maybe ending is sad when Hiccup finished without feet but I liked this all visual thrills . This movie is really great and I like it .", "Seriously, I never thought that any Non-pixar could get an Oscar...Until now, i have finished almost all the animation films..but never voted 10 for a non-pixar..pixar's ruling the animation world..Now there's something that reached Pixar! The best movie i have seen in years! 3D/2D doesn't matter! all that matters is the story and the 'Feel'! I lost time and lost my mind in the movie for about that 90 minutes! Goosebumps, Happiness, tears- all in one Screen...Wow! This is not a movie for kids. definitely a movie for everyone. Go watch it.. 90 minutes of your life will be once worthy! I guarantee! Thanks to Dreamworks.  10.5/10.....You will confirm my rating! hoping to that.;-)", "Now this is what I'm talking about! A movie that truly embraces and takes advantage of its 3D IMAX touch and it was quite an exhilarating, charming, fun, funny and touching animation feature that gets everything right. You will recognize a lot of A-list stars in this pic including Gerald Butler but this time it wasn't an distraction or had an ego and that's why most animation pics work because their is no ego involved just a vision and a story. At first to be honest I was hesitant thinking this might be just another overrated movie and didn't really win me over right away but once the dragon training and building relationships starts to unfold it wins your heart if you have one. After that it doesn't look back and becomes enchanting with amazing visual effects that actually made me say wow now that's amazing and beautiful and it was just breathtaking during the dragon flight scenes. I heard some critics comparing it to Avatar when it came to the flying scenes and I have to say that to me it surpasses it by a mile when it came to that and when it came to heart & soul, adventure, personality and the magical excitement, it made me feel like a kid again. This one will lift your spirit touch you to the brink of tears and thrill you with its eye popping 3D IMAX effects which to me still needs some work but this movie brings it in the right direction. Overall this is great for everyone young to old and it's in the lead for being the best animation film of the year and while not as great as Up I think it was close to being just as great as it. Highly recommended! More of a 4.5 out of 5 stars.", "That part where we think a monster is something nice is a bit overused, but it works really well with How to Train Your Dragon. To break down the good parts, there's the script, the plot, the characters, voice acting and the animation. The script had enough amounts of comedy, but not too much to ruin the film and make people laugh, thereby forgetting the real story. No, none of that. It was almost real, the things that make you go MLIA at the same time, make you LOL. Not only are the slight comedic remarks good, but how they used the script to make the character development smooth and truthful. And with the script comes the characters and the plot. We start out with a few good stereotypes: a wimpy outcast who befriends something people think is a monster. Right, we've seen that before... and the other things are pretty usual. But the smaller things make the movie itself an unusual gem. And the ending--OH IF I COULD ONLY TELL YOU (but I can't, so go watch it)--can bring a tear to the eye. The plot used all the normal elements and all the usual plot devices, but at the same time made it different, unusual and altogether fantastic. And now we have voice acting and animation. They go well with each other. The animation was fantastic. They didn't try to make things believable, because the semi-realistic, cartoon-ish look of everything contributes to the fantasy world that the film dwells in. The expressions on the characters faces, how the gesticulate and all, they compliment the only too perfect voice acting that was given. (For example... THIS IS SPARTAAAAA's very own Gerard Butler, playing the role of the head Viking. And Jay Baruchel as the wimpy hero. And...America Ferrera as Astrid, leading lady--and nobody expected that, but it worked. It really did.) AND THE FIGHT SCENESSSSSSS. \\m/ When something blasts, it's almost too real. Which only leads me to compliment the sound effects--and the music too. Was there anything wrong with this movie? Only very little, that the normal viewer wouldn't even notice it. Like when you watch it in 3D, there's barely any difference. It might actually look better if you watch it in 2D. It definitely deserves a good watching. Bring your family with you, or your friends. All I have to say now is that... well, Dreamworks did it again.", "I was looking forward to seeing this animation in 3D and I was completely taken aback. It's worth every penny that you spend on tickets and if you loved avatar, you'll love this equally. The movie was incredibly enjoyable till the very end, filled with fun,excitement and comedy. The voice talent was evident and did justice to each character, making them very likable.  It had a wonderful storyline and the best parts in the movie which most will agree to were the beautiful backgrounds and breathtaking scenes that we saw while Toothless and Hiccup soared over the skies. In most scenes, I had my jaws dropped or a wide smile of contentment. I could see kids sitting at the edge of their seats holding on to the arms of their chairs in excitement and awe. The adults there didn't seem to hide their emotions as well with their ooo's, aaa's and aww's. It's definitely a must see.", "A new bent on the Androcles and the Lion fable, and it does that old story proud. The movie is very surprisingly articulate and upbeat for an animated film, and speaks on a sweet moral. It accomplishes this by sticking to its own story's point, developing it well, and avoiding pop-culture reference jokes. Although they've often been cute in other animated features, pop culture vibes would have been out of place here. It has a wonderfully balanced group of necessary characters, each with a specific purpose to construct the story. Each character is developed in a logical and effective manner; each is very human and equally likable. The many interactions and conflicts are handled well in advancing the plot to a grand ending which does not disappoint. A Viking boy, who has plenty of heart and desire, but is lacking in skill to live out his aspirations, seeks the approval of his community and his father, the leader of the community. Flying fire-breathing dragons regularly raid the village for food, and attacks have cost many casualties on both sides over a long period of time. When the boy encounters one, he grants mercy, which is soon reciprocated. A loyal friendship is the reward, which opens new challenges. Watching suspicion and fear gradually scaled away for new understanding is what this very positive and touching story is all about. Astrid is a particularly appealing character whose change illustrates the movie's theme the best. The secret behind the dragon's seemingly violent behavior is crafted well, and sets up an expertly choreographed climactic finale. The 3-D technology is utilized as an artistic asset, not merely a stylized gimmick. It brings depth to this story's world, and magnifies the breathtaking and exceptional visuals. A wonderful production all around. Recommended.", "I'm not usually a big fan of Dreamworks animation, and I didn't think this movie looked all that interesting from the trailer, but after hearing great things about it, I decided to check out. I definitely wasn't let down. \"Dragons\" was absolutely fantastic in IMAX 3D (well worth the extra money for this film!). Not only did it look great, the story was fun and sweet at the same time. You'll definitely enjoy this movie, especially if you love pets (the main dragon character reminded me of 2 things: Stitch from Disney's \"Lilo & Stitch\", and a playful cat!) And the beautiful flying scenes almost give \"Avatar\" a run for its money... almost :) All-around great movie. Go check it out. 9/10", "I currently work at a cinema and I've been hearing a trailer to this movie and I first thought \"sounds interesting, but I bet it has too much 3D effects and the storyline is rubbish\". After a while, I kept hearing the trailer and I though, I'll give this movie a try when it comes out. I'm glad I did, because if you see any movie this year. Put this one on your list. It is brilliant, the 3D effects are good (but not over the top) and has a great story. It all centres on a young Viking called Hiccup who doesn't fit in with his tribe of fellow Vikings. What he lacks in strength, he more than makes up for in intelligence. One night, his tribe gets attacked by dragons and later on befriends an injured dragon who he calls toothless. But after a while, Hiccup soon starts to see things from the dragon's point of view and not only has to change what his attitude, but those of his tribe as well including the chief who happens to be his dad. Can he succeed? Well you will need to watch this movie to find out.  Although it is an animated movie for children in mind, adults will also find it entertaining as well. In some parts it is funny and in others quite sad, especially at the end of the film. All in all, an amazing movie and I recommend you see it.", "Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a young, skinny boy who lives in a Viking village by the seashore. He wants to be a Viking like his father Stoick (Gerard Butler) so that he can slay dragons too. The village is regularly plagued by the beasts that steal the livestock. His father does not believe that he has the qualities and the strength to become one though and fears that it is too dangerous for him. To prove his worth, Hiccup decides to attack a dragon himself and much to his own surprise he actually manages to hit something. Travelling through the woods, he discovers what he has wounded: a Night Fury, one of the most dangerous dragon kinds. He prepares to slay the beast but is unable to bring himself to finish the task. Instead, he helps to mend the dragon's wings and brings it food. He gradually develops a cautious relationship with the creature. Hiccup's life becomes even more complicated though when his father returns from an adventure and decides that it is time to enrol Hiccup in a dragon slaying class with a number of other mean students too, including Astrid (America Ferrera) a beautiful young Viking girl that Hiccup has a crush on. Aside from the annual Pixar films, animated pictures that are engaging for both adults and children are scarce. How to Train Your Dragon though, from Dreamworks and directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, is familiar but extremely lively and likable entertainment that almost anyone can enjoy. As with Dreamworks' very best film Shrek this is essentially about seeing the beauty in the most seemingly alien and dangerous things, while also learning to view the world in a new perspective by overcoming one's fears. This is certainly not in the same league as the first Shrek film nor does not obtain the emotional power of Pixar's Up either. This is because the narrative is largely safe, avoiding taking the audience anywhere they have not been before in regards to the plot and the character relationships. Yet this is less concerning here because the script has still been so smartly written, not only because it retains this familiar subtext about understanding one's enemies, but also because it provides consistently witty and funny dialogue for all the characters. It is because of this that even with a less familiar cast, the actors are still able to inhabit their characters with such fun and energy. No matter how familiar it might seem, this is such a charming and thoughtful film. Adding to much of the film's appeal are the visuals and the art direction. How to Train Your Dragon is showing in both 2D and 3D but viewing it in the standard format does not compromise the quality of the picture at all. This is a strikingly beautiful and cinematic experience, which bursts life and colour into the environments. The attention to detail on the textures, like the woodwork on the Viking ships and the individual character models, is splendid, displaying the amount of care that went into designing the very look and style of this film. The aesthetics also aid the excitement of the action sequences as well. There are a number of flying sequences on the back of the dragon and the way that it dips and glides over the top of the sea and then soars through a series of tinted red clouds is awe-inspiring. Almost every action sequence here is not only exciting but relatively harmless for smaller children to enjoy as well. Only the climactic battle feels slightly overwrought but it is doubtful as to whether younger viewers will be particularly concerned. Interestingly, while watching the film in 2D one can almost pinpoint where the 3D technology could make a monster or a sequence more immediate, suggesting that it may not be a complete gimmick to see the film in 3D, unlike some other recent films. The familiarity of How to Train Your Dragon is forgivable because it covers common ground with an abundance of charm, humour and visual flair that makes it largely irresistible. This is a beautiful film to see on the big screen, with a level of detail that develops one's belief in this rich setting. It would almost certainly be more immediate in 3D, but regardless of the format the quality of the script remains, with mature messages and clever dialogue that the cast relishes admirably.", "So the 3D Bandwagon rolls forward, and whilst I'm amongst many that don't want 3D to take over the film industry but I do think it has it's place. Avatar used 3D brilliantly to make it an involving, immersive film, animated films, like Up look spectacular in 3D, so How To Train YOur Dragon falls under that category. Where I don't like 3D is when it is just cheaply converted in 3D and throws stuff at the camera, so they pop out at you, yes, sometimes it is good, but otherwise it is just cheap film making. So before I express my views on the movie let me tell you what it's about How to Train Your Dragon, follows a young viking living in a village where Dragons are pests. His father is the chief viking, and this young boy is to be trained all his life to learn to kill dragons. This young boy (Hiccup) is not a very tough boy, and he isn't a very good slayer, but when he befriends a Dragon secretly he learns more about these creatures and what their characteristics are and that there is much more to these animals. The Film gets off to a slow start, but when the boy and dragon start flying, this becomes a short and sweet animated film, reminiscent of Kung-FU Panda. The Voice Acting was pretty good, not quite Toy Story, but still a good effort. The 3D Was done superbly, with subtle touches to breathtaking shots at you, it really felt like you were there, so much so it was enough to rival Avatar. The Movies characters all contributed to this movie, and do capture a great deal of emotion in scenes for this movie. The movie really was entertaining, in the highest order, the plot flowed well, and really captured the audience. The whole film as I said before was really reminiscent of Kung-Fu Panda, a short, cute heartwarming movie.", "This is a superb 3D movie, and I was blown away by the flight sequences. Even if the plot is clich\u00e9 to a lot of these 3D movies about a screw up becoming a hero later on. Just watching the flight sequences was enough for the price of admission, even if none of the characters are even remotely memorable. Watch this movie in theaters or IMAX in 3D or it isn't going to be as good, kids and adults will have a good time watching this, even if the plot is straight forward the pacing however is well done. This film is one of the prime examples of effective 3D and a very well done one at that as well. 7.9/10", "The poorly titled animated adventure belies the simple boy meets dragon story as seen in trailers. This is a beautiful looking Viking epic, starting with an almost impossible opening sequence that juggles the introduction to all the characters, some jokes about viking life, all the while a huge dragon attack is taking place. As with any tentpole movie, effects or extravagant animated environments mean nothing if the story and characters aren't interesting. Here, our dragon trainer has a likable misfit nature that keeps the audience (both young and old) amused. That is one element usually missing in non-Pixar films. There are well formed characters throughout the ensemble, all of them showing personality and capable of generating good humour. I went to the 3D showing, and was not expecting much more than a cutesy tale of a boy training a dragon. To be sure the cutesy stuff is in there, certainly not shying away from giving dragons Disney-like big eyes and even purring like a kitten. What I was pleasantly amazed to find was that there is a lively Viking adventure that has a whimsical spirit. The Vikings come off as more than 2 dimensional, and the sweeping 3D shots give a great thrill ride around jagged cliffs. The central plot is a Vikings journey by boat to fight the dragons, and most of the obligatory love interest and bully subplots don't get in the way. Perhaps one could complain about plot holes in how a young kid disappears constantly without anybody connecting it with his new dragon training abilities. Several convenient plot points allow the story to whisk us along, wasting no moment on screen to move forward boy-trains-dragon, boy-meets-girl, and boy-rebels-against-society story arcs. If you can keep the audience entertained, then you can pull off the magic act of suspending disbelief, something harder to do with adults watching this type of animated fare, then you have achieved that Pixar feeling. One of the very few animated films not made by Pixar that have done this. 7 out of 10.", "Dreamworks was always the little baby to Pixar's big brother animation but with 'How to train your dragon' they finally grew up.  The movie is simply brilliant. It has everything to make you smile, cry and get excited with. The leads were all marvelous with standout performance by Craig Ferguson and Gerald Butler. Of course Hiccups and Toothless stole the show.  The animation looks rough which was perfect for the story since it was set during the medieval times. But don't be fooled by it for the animation was par excellent when compared to UP.  That said, this movie is for all ages. Not giving anything away, you will want to watch it again and again for the sheer brilliance of the movie's plot. No slapstick jokes nor silly moments. Every scene delivers a unforgettable moment.  Dreamworks is really pushing the envelope with their latest release, after the last brilliant 'Alien & Monsters' This is one movie I can't wait for the DVD.  So go watch it and trust me, you will love this movie.", "Watched this dragonimated movie last Tuesday. I never read any review about it even though a friend told me it's a good movie. So when someone offered me a ticket, I was only say \"uh? okay\u0085\". No, I'm not an animation hater. It just didn't catch my interest that some kid trying to pet a dragon. Well, at least, I thought he was\u0085. That is, until I get to see what How To Train Your Dragon really is. At first it all looks typical. A loser kid who wanna gain his fame through famous dragon-killing tradition. Hit a dragon, but ain't able to kill it. So what did he do? exactly! train it. In the end, he'll gonna save the day with his dragon he named \"Toothless\". I was wrong. How To Train Your Dragon eventually gives you more than just classic animation story. There's no \"I realize I was wrong, please forgive me\" things going on (except for the father, once), no extremely good guy/bad guy, and no overrated drama. It's naturally fresh by the way it take us to the next level of animation-journey. Whereas we already gone through far-far away or just simply do a kick in Kungfu Panda, How To Train Your Dragon teach us about being ourselves and the meaning of friendship in a more fun, exiting way. Ending was terrific. Though at some point we can still smell what's gonna happen next, the execution itself or how they bring the visual as well as the story is beyond my expectations. The loser did not magically become powerful or instantly popular. He take what he deserve and try to be the best he can be. Afterall, sometimes being different does make you the only one capable of making improvement. Some people said How To Train Your Dragon is way much better than Shrek or Kungfu Panda. My friend even said \"once you watch it, you'll want your own dragon for sure!\" Well it didn't catch me that far, but yeah it's a wonderful-fun-happy booster movie to watch. Total cuteness in visual (just look at those dragons, they're very cute!), and it also comes in 3D. So what are you waiting for? Go watch it, people. :)", "This film is about a cowardly viking guy who is unable to fight and slay a dragon. He finds another way to deal with dragons, with unexpected results. I thought the dragons were were designed well. The dragons are scary and dangerous looking, and yet paradoxically cute at the same time. The main dragon has easy-to-interpret facial expressions which can be useful in teaching kids to read faces. The story is a little slow paced at first, but the intensity and emotional depths in the last half hour makes the whole film worthwhile. I particularly liked the message that if you understand, then you will be tolerant and can coexist with others. I enjoyed watching \"How to Train Your Dragon\".", "Dragon is probably one of the most entertaining films I've seen in the theater for a while. Full of viking/dragon action, some fantastic aerial scenes, and a bit of humor, Dragon is not only a pleasant film for kids but for adults too. The fact that it revolves around dragons also helps quite a bit, because otherwise I'm afraid it would be a bit too run of the mill. Nothing about the films setup is very surprising. It's your typical story about human being misunderstanding creatures and killing them because of such. No different really from other films dealing with the innate fear humans have and the effects of such fear. In this one, vikings are seemingly terrorized by dragons, until one of the vikings, Hiccup, injures one and begins to make friends with it. Yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill. But, this is a case of the specifics separating this film from others. First of all, there are dragons, and everyone knows dragons are cool. Secondly, there are vikings, and who doesn't like a good viking story. Putting these two together is like mixing cheesecake and chocolate: it just works. But in all seriousness, it's a good combination that provides for some truly entertaining scenes involving lots of dragon riding. Now, if you're turned off by the fact that the story is mostly been there, done that safety work, then this may not be for you. I know everyone searches for originality, and this is probably about as unoriginal as an animation can get. But, if you can get over that fact, then you will probably also find this to be quite fun. I for one have no problem with something clich\u00e9, as long as all the pieces fit together and it's entertaining. And this was.  My only real gripe with the film is the voice acting. It feels a bit phoned in, and I never really got any personality from the characters through their voices. The cast did decent, serviceable work, but it's nothing memorable, which is really a shame. Although, I will say that the choice of Gerard Butler was pretty good casting, if only because he definitely fits the part of the tough viking leader. The film is also quite technically sound, with some incredible scenes of flight. Most of the best parts are of Hiccup and his pet dragon flying around.  Dragon may not be the most original animation on the market, but it fits together quite nicely. It's highly entertaining and the dragons are quite likable. It's also pleasant to see a film that doesn't shy away from some more mature content, particularly at the end. It's nice to see the studio not treating our children as if they were blind to the ill tidings of the world. Kids will like this, children will like this, and people in between may find it quite enjoyable too.", "Well, i went to a 12 o'clock session to this 3D movie with not a lot of expectations to this movie, then i'm sitting down with my glasses, having Mcdonolds on my lap (its not that bad) and waiting for the movie to start. To what i can say honestly, this movie was worth-it. The characters were some how original, cgi effects were superb, the dragons were huge, some of the music was intense but touching. All around perfect from the start to the action-packed finale in the end. So, if you're thinking of seeing Sam Worthington in Clash of the Titans in 3D where you would expect an epic 3D action adventure, you may not expect what you get from that movie but if you want to see a better film that has appropriate scenes for kids, funny and happy scenes, wild dragon action and finally some love in the movie. Then grab some friends and have a great time of 'How to Train your Dragon' in 3D. Well worth my $13.00.", "I usually don't like Hollywood animations(Exception for one or two Pixars'S but that's all). They all always put the same crap over and over again with different themes. There's mostly someone who is different from his/her environment, and doesn't get along with people around his/her as a result. First we see disappointment than new friend come to help our's buddy. Together, they correct the things that doesn't fit their ideal worlds. At the and big success, applause and huraaaay! mode. How to Train Your Dragon isn't exception to this, so -to speak- American way of animation unfortunately. I know exactly what will happen at very beginning of the movie. If I wasn't tight fisted fella I would leave at the half of the movie. In short same crap with different theme. Dreamworks budy, you are suck at this business. Why bother watch things like these while we have incredibly deep and satisfying Japanase animations? I strongly recommend Toki o kakeru sh\u00f4jo.", "I love a lot of modern cartoons, \"Spirited Away\", \"Shrek\", \"Toy Story\", \"Wall-E\" etc etc. I love them because they are sophisticated, have interesting, intelligent and surprising plot and love-able characters. Unfortunately, \"How to train your Dragon\" has none of these. The plot is very basic and you understand exactly how it is going to turn, the general humor will appeal, no doubt, to kids, but I didn't find anything funny about it. Still, it is watchable and you probably won't suffer from watching it. Expect it to be more on par with the likes of \"Ice Age\" than \"Shrek\", however.", "What is so special about animation? Since all the camera angles, character expressions and body languages are fully controllable by the filmmaker, the result is all animation movies are fun to watch. So it's very hard for me to criticize it. Thiz kind of movie depends on the whole divisions without exception. The credit does not just belong to Director. Thiz movie is directed by Disney's \"Lilo and Stitch\" (2002) creators, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders. The characters are voiced by Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Jonah Hill and America Ferrera. A Viking boy named Hiccup (Baruchel) is learning how to become a warrior. One day, instead of vanquishing the dragon as he told to, they end up being friends. The dragon character which named Toothless has a unique figure but still lovable. Yes, it's entertaining but still on standard formula. The story relies on what I called \"Zero to Hero\" formula. The main character is mostly described as a nerd type and later becomes a savior for his people. The best part of thiz film is the flying scene which is so thrilling and exciting. Yes, it's another CGI animation. Yes, it's another feel good movie. Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com", "This was a pretty good animated movie. I really liked the dragons as there are several different kinds that are designed uniquely and are colorful. It's about a Viking boy, Hiccup, that befriends a dragon. The dragon has injured its tail and can't fly out of this valley. Hiccup makes a device to go on the tail that aids the dragon in flying and he also makes himself a saddle. Now he's flying on the dragon and learning that the beliefs about dragons being evil are not true. He's also in dragon killing training school with some other kids. He starts to dominate because he knows what they like and can make them act like pets. Of course hid dad finds out and wants to slay more dragons. Can Hiccup and his friends stop them and save the day? It's a kids film, what do you think. FINAL VERDICT: Cute movie with cool animated dragons, worth a viewing", "all what I can say that this is the best animation movie I have ever seen , the story , the animation design , everything was great , if you didn't watch it , then you missed an awesome 95 minutes of your life . thanks for everyone that shared in this great movie and brought it to us so we can be really entertained . special thanks for you \" Gerard Butler \" if you are reading this I wanna tell you that you are one of my favorite actors . I hope that will be a second part for this movie . by the way guys the comedy in this movie is so cool \" Jay Baruchel \" is a very good comedy actor , he got his mission done in this movie . Adventure , Action , Comedy , Drama ( that what you will find in this movie ) Special thanks for the directors \" Chris Sanders & Dean Deblois \" for making this movie came out like that , it's almost perfect .", "I went to see this movie last night, and I still can not stop thinking about it. This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen, combined with animated and live action. The movie engages you right from the start and doesn't let up until it is over. Just because this movie is animated does not mean it is just for kids. It has something for everyone. I am 20 years old and I still loved it! Another huge plus is the soundtrack, I have been listening to it ever since I got back from the movie. It is a very well done score. If I had more money, I would be more than willing to see it multiple times in the theater.", "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is quite possibly my favorite film of the year thus far. With an intriguing plot, lovable characters, and 3D effects that quite literally make you sit on the edge of your seat, this is a cinematic experience that is NOT to be missed. I won't go in to extravagant detail, because I'm afraid that doing so will conjure a spoiler or two. So, let summarize HTTYD in two words: Absolutely incredible. If you like the films Dreamworks produces, then you owe it to yourself to drop a few bucks to watch this. Even if you aren't the biggest fan of Shrek or Dreamworks' other notable characters and movies, you *still* owe it to yourself to catch this film before it leaves the theater. What I assumed would be a dinky little kids' movie was SO much more than that. The animation may seem a bit 'kiddish' to some, but trust me. Ten minutes in to the movie, and you will be h-o-o-k-e-d. Jay Baruchel does a great job providing the voice for Hiccup (the movie's main protagonist), but in my opinion, Gerard Butler stole the show. Bar none. I've been a fan of Gerard since I watched \"300\" - he plays a Leonidas-type character in HTTYD, as the 'chieftain' I suppose you could call it of the Vikings -, and he does a phenomenal job here. For that matter, every man and women who provide voices for this movie pull off astounding performances. They should be proud of themselves. It may sound like I'm exaggerating, but I can assure you, I'm not. This movie touched my *soul* - and that, my friends, hasn't happened in a very long time. This is my first written review on IMDb, and I hope you gained something from it. \"How To Train Your Dragon\" is a movie that is not to be missed. Take your kids, take your girlfriend/boyfriend, take your spouse, or take your grandma! Go see this movie today if you haven't already. You won't be disappointed.", "I did not come into this movie expecting to be entertained.  I am a huge Pixar fan, and therefore have an intense hatred of DreamWorks.  Despite this, I found myself liking the movie. The dragons, especially Toothless, were adorable. Hiccup had me liking him from the start, but I started liking the movie that moment he didn't kill Toothless.  A few things I didn't like- Astrid hating him at first, and then, after he almost gets her killed, she falls in love with him.  The animation was better than I expected- Not on level with most Pixar films, especially when the characters were wet(the dad barely looked it at some points), but much better than past DreamWorks movies.  However, it was the ending that had me loving this movie.  DreamWorks has finally made a good movie.", "I went into this movie with much curiosity because of the excessively good reviews, and I will simply say that this is the best animated movie of all time. From the beginning I was simply in awe because of how beautifully done the 3D was, and how amazingly it was visually. Although, visuals SHOULD NOT be the only thing to drive a movie forward... but How to Train Your Dragon has it all. The plot immediately caught my interest and held on until after it was all over. It just felt so real... a feeling animated features rarely give me. The strongest factor in this feeling was the character development. Every single character in this film developed and changed in the same ways real people do. Nothing extreme like going from evil to good, but in more subtle ways just as real people do. My personal favorite character was Toothless the \"Night Fury\" dragon. I could not believe how much personality this non speaking creature had...it reminded me so much of how a pet would act in real life only with a bit more intelligence. The musical score and the animation matched (maybe even surpassed) Pixar in quality. See this in 3D as it is meant to be. Visually and emotionally STUNNING!", "Dreamworks may not produce the same 'magical' movies that come from the Mouse House, however when it comes to animated action nobody does it better. Sure Wall-E and Up feature wonderfully emotive images and beautifully heart-warming stories that are ripe for Oscar drool, but they don't have Avatar-esquire, high-flying dragon sequences on display either. Sentiment and heart may ensure longevity but it's these exhilarating set-pieces that'll have you jumping on your seat throughout the film then buzzing with excitement whilst leaving the cinema. The kids will have fun too. Impressively, writer-directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders have managed to match the action with a well-balanced story that includes plenty of verbal and visual wit. They haven't skimped on the laughs and ensure there's plenty for all ages; the sillier slapstick comedy will keep the younglings happy whilst the written jokes will entertain everyone. There's a message of 'be yourself no matter what' that provides the lynchpin of the tale although gratefully DeBlois and Sanders don't hammer it home excessively, allowing the adrenaline-pumping action and consistent humour to flow freely. The voice cast \u2013 with a few recognisable accents \u2013 are solid without being memorable. Baruchel is well-suited to the major role of Hiccup, his awkward tones giving the part another level of amusement. With his deep, stentorian voice, Butler makes a formidable Stoick but unfortunately isn't stretched by the one dimensional character. Of the rest Hill is a highlight as the aggressively dim-witted Snotlout whilst Ferrera gives adroit warrior \u2013 and the desire of Hiccup's affections \u2013 Astrid a nice balance of tough-as-nails bravado and girl-next-door charm. A stirring adventure worthy of the extra few bucks to see in IMAX. 4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)", "Ever since I got the chance to visit Dreamworks Studios last summer, I've been dying to see this film, and it did not disappoint! with Dreamworks animated films, its usually hit or miss with them, but HTRYD is a big success. Visually it's awesome, if you are a fan of dragons like I am your or your children should definitely enjoy this, whether or not you read the book its based on dosen't really matter, this movie is a lot of fun and the way the dragons were depicted was great. the movie follows a pretty simple formula.. awkward weak kid who isn't like everyone else, fails at everything, and dosen't get any respect from his friends and family but ends up proving himself in another way. But here it works for the story quite well. The story isn't perfect or too deep or whatever, but I think it was just fine for what it was. and of course I think anyone watching this, adult or child will love the main dragon character Toothless..he is basically Stitch from Lilo and Stich in dragon form, after all the writers and directors of this film also created Lilo and Stitch, but even so the dragon has his own lovable personality. as far as what format to go see this in, I saw it in 3D because the theater I went to only offered it in 3D..but the 3D was quite enjoyable...it was more subtle and mostly just added more depth to everything which was nice..and in some scenes it really was great to look at, so I suggest seeing it in 3D, but I try seeing it earlier in the day, $9 for a early afternoon showing...yikes! SO if you are looking to be entertained go see this film, anyone should enjoy it!", "So I saw \"How to train your dragon\", from 2010. So is it a good movie. Well the answer is no. O.K this movie is visually stunning, but with the evolotion of CGI, these incredible to look at movies are becoming common place. Also this is a kid's movie, and yeah if I was a small child I might think wow this is awesome, but I am not. There are movies which cross the divide between toddler and adult, for instance the original Shrek or even Shrek II (when the cops found a bag of catnip on puss'n'boots and he says \"thats not mine\" is just awesome). Hell, I even loved all three toy story movies. Granted you could say I have a problem with the kids all having American accents, but even if I accept this because it is a movie, why do the adult Vikings talk with Scottish accents. Shouldn't they sound more like the Swedish chef from the muppets, now that's funny. This story will probably play over well with average people and kids. However, if you are an adult, and don't have a dragon fetish, this is just the same old story about how we don't always know someone, until we get to know them, and a monster is not always a monster. Unless I was planning to do some hallucinogens while listening to pink floyd, while this was on in the background, it is just not worth seeing. If you have a family or are not into truly interesting cinema maybe this movie is your cup of tea. If you are a hipster who enjoys movies like the original shrek, you will probably be disappointed. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/", "The message of the film is great: even the seemingly evil dragons are actually not evil but just like you - they have also feelings like you, need also food like you, and so on. This is a great message for a family movie and I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot. But the end ruined it all and this is why.\nIn the end, the maker of the movie simply created a bigger dragon which is told to be the actual reason for all the problems described before and this big dragon is truly just evil. And this is such a stupid thing to do because it implies that there are just evil beings that must be killed. But the message of the film was actually supposed to be the opposite! That were actually the beliefs of the vikings that the boy prooved to be wrong! And in fact the message of the movie applies to the bigger dragon, too: the bigger dragon simply needs food and this is why it eats the other animals. We are doing the same. But the vikings and dragons start attacking the big dragon, hit it in the eye which hurts it a lot (so the bigger dragon has feeling just like is, too), burning it with flames and eventually killing it. After that horrible scene it gets even worse: once the bigger dragon has died, there is peace and harmony. This is such a terrible message for a family movie and, again, it totally contradicts the message the movie is supposed to have, because in the end all this movie is telling you is: find the evil, kill it and everything will be great. The analogy to human thinking and the reason for wars is obvious and in this sense the movie supports the idea that a war is a good thing since it destroyes the evil. So this movie pretends to have a lovely message and I have neither understanding why the makers included this big irony nor why so few people see this obvious contradiction. To me it was just painful to watch how the boy shows that the seemingly evil dragons are just like us and later they all attack the bug dragon, hurt it a lot and eventually kill it. This is a terrible movie and I give it only one star.", "With an average score of 8.2 stars, this title fits in snugly to the top 250 films of all time. To me, this is simply an absolute joke. To begin with, the main character is named 'Hiccup'. Even the character himself acknowledges how awful a choice this is. It adds nothing. The voice acting for 'Hiccup' is performed by a disgustingly sarcastic man with a head cold. It really is painful to listen to at times. Amusingly the majority of the other Vikings appear to be Scottish. As for the story itself, you could literally take out the dragons and it would be any other Dreamworks film ever. While some may enjoy this 'style' it just gets incredibly tedious and predictable, allowing the audience to basically write the film 10 minutes before it happens. For the love of god would it kill them to try to make anything at all original. Attempts to think outside the box on this occasion appear to have landed them inside another box, which itself was inside a well defined crate. Also, the dragons are basically cats.  For me to enjoy this film I would either have to be 10 years younger or 10 IQ points stupider. 3/10", "I know a film meant for children (or a \"family\" movie so to speak) is working right when even as I can recognize where the whole plot will go, A to B to C to Z, when I think that if I were a child of 7, 8, 13 or whatever, I'd really love it. Perhaps I've moved on from being able to be really invigorated by these stories, where a nerdy outsider connects with another outsider in a society where their bond is sort of verboten. Hell, we probably have already seen this formula done, to one degree or another, in just the stable of Dreamworks animated films in the past years (shades of Kung-fu Panda spring to mind). But the good news is that the filmmakers give the characters some good life and circumstances, and the energy in the action and drama is high. But what also makes it work is that a) when it needs to be funny, it's very funny (quips I didn't think could work won me over), and b) when it needs to, pun intended, the movie soars. Many will be immediately reminded of another movie filled with \"flying things\" from some months back, James Cameron's Avatar. While his film implemented cutting-edge 3D technology, I found seeing this film, in just the straight 2D, just as good if not, really, better in some ways. When it comes time to follow along with 'Toothless' the dragon and Hiccup as they piroutte through the sky, I was completely with it since I already was soaked up into this world. This isn't to denigrate Cameron's work inasmuch as to just make a point of comparison: it doesn't look quite as silly, oddly enough, by having dragons with this film as opposed to the whatever-the-hell prehistoric hybrids the Na'vi rode along. I digress though, the film is easy to see where it will go. The plot turns, the conflicts, the interest from the girl to the hero and the supporting characters, no convention is unturned. But the writing within the conventions are strong; the filmmakers understand how to work within them to bring out creativity in the artwork, in the action, in the connections with the characters, and when it comes time for the vikings to face off against the big baddie-dragon at the end (as we all can expect), it's exhilarating how the pace keeps picking up just when one expects for it to drop. And, ultimately, as repeated as the message might be, the under-current of \"peace and understanding\" vs \"FIGHT\" is a good message to send to the kids, with the most unlikely placement of vikings who pray to Odin and the dragons who fight against them (but as we learn in self-defense). The voice-work is also uniformly interesting. I liked seeing Baruchel in this lead part, doing what he could with a nerdy hero; Gerard Butler shows why he should stick mostly to his original Scottish accent (it's also nice, by the way, to hear Craig Ferguson in a movie again; the actors playing the 'kids' all, oddly enough, don't have the Scottish twang, but still work well for what's required of their parts as sort of comic relief. And when it comes time to show the bond between Hiccup and the dragon, the writers don't jump to the quips: the dragons never speak, and all of the direction and attention can be found in their eyes and mouths and face contortions. It's really like the story of a boy and his dog or horse and in this, the heart of the picture, it surprised me with how well it worked. 7.5/10", "This is a good but not great movie that I liked but did not love. My principal objection is to the fact that one spends a great deal of time watching dragons swish their tails around and eat fish and be confused and do other things that are not awesome. It could be protested that this is consistent with the film's likable themes of peaceful coexistence and friendship. I am not interested in excuses; I am interested in seeing cool things happen in movies. A good movie finds ways to let the viewer see awesome things. For example, the terrific family adventure movie Kung-Fu Panda has many great kung-fu fights throughout its entirety. Imagine if the kung-fu fighters always found reasonable excuses to not fight most of the time in that movie. What a bad movie that would be. The viewer of How to Train Your Dragon is given just such an experience. I enjoy when movies, particularly movies like this one that appeal to a younger audience, feature strong female characters. The character of Astrid in this film is a strong character. Within the context of the goofy fantasy society she lives in, she is more like an aggressive over-achiever - she is expected to fight dragons, and does so well. She is not rewarded for her hard work because the hero destroys the entire system of values to which she dedicated her life. Nonetheless, she is a strong young lady, and that's cool. She gets sold out later, at the end of the film, when all the kids get to ride around on dragons, and she has to ride behind the hero on one of the crappy dragons until he can jump off to ride the coolest dragon of all. Why can't she ride on the second best dragon? The character of Snotlout, who is a jerk, gets to ride on the second best dragon, and she has to ride behind the hero. She is also very pretty aside from being good at things, so when boys like her, it's like, do they like her because she's good at things? Probably not. Anyways, this movie has a pretty good but far from perfect strong female character.", "How to Train Your Dragon is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very impressive voice cast.It is a very enjoyable family movie that has enough funny parts that children will enjoy and parts just for adults to laugh at as well,it is also very heartwarming and the animation is absolutely beautiful.I'm not gonna lie,when I first saw the trailers I taught it looked like just another movie that Dreamworks were making for merchandise purposes,just to make more money basically,but the movie is very inspired,the characters are very well developed and it has good potential to become a great new film series.How to Train Your Dragon is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good animated or family film.  A young Viking training to be as good as his father soon becomes friends with a dragon and discovers they may not be as deadly as they seem.", "3D effects are fairly slick, cool, and fits in the eye. The film is about a Viking people who lived in a village where food supplies are often taken by the dragon. Therefore, they prepare themselves with how to train their children also to be ready to crush the dragons. When I watch this movie, many small children. I feel like a kid again. Therefore if you are confused to find entertainment as well as an interesting spectacle for your kids, I highly recommend this movie to you. I am speak-less to this movie, very awe.... wait for it.... some. Awesome!", "In the Viking village of Berk, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), the young, idiotic son of the village chieftain Stoick (Gerard Butler), longs to follow in his father Stoick's (Gerard Butler) footsteps and become a famous dragon warrior. When their village is ambushed by dragons, Hiccup shoots down the most notorious dragon of all, known as Night Wing, who's penetrating scream is all that can be heard before a flash of light and the inevitable destruction. Of course, nobody believes him, and when he finds the wounded dragon, Hiccup realises he cannot bring himself to kill it. He instead invents a contraption that will help it's damaged wing, and after earning it's trust by bringing it food, begins to ride it. But while on a flight trying to impress his potential girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera), the Night Wing is swept into the dragon nest, where an even bigger threat to the village is laying dormant. For a Dreamworks animated effort, How To Train Your Dragon holds up refreshingly well when compared to the likes of Pixar, and to the rest of Dreamworks' rather shoddy past output. What works best is directors' Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois desire to keep things more grown up. This is a film more for the Lord of the Rings audience than those who somehow enjoyed the Shrek sequels and Madagascar (2005), with its execution rooted in fantasy and folklore. There are many different types of dragons in the film, each with a different 'power' and level of danger it brings with it, keeping the whole dragon mythology refreshing amidst a flurry of post-Rings fantasy efforts involving the giant fire- breathers. The opening battle scene is an explosion of action and comedy, an exciting way to discover the world these characters inhabit and witness Hiccup's ineptitude compared to his father's unrivalled prowess. This being Dreamworks, it then decides to pander to the much younger audience, by introducing the (admittedly cute) Night Wing, whom Hiccup renames Toothless, and the younger inhabitants of the village (voiced by the likes of Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse). It was at this point where I asked myself why the elder villagers all have Scottish accents, while the younger ones sound pre-pubescent Americans in a mall. Obviously, it's a way of helping the younger (American) audience to relate to these characters, but to me it's just damn lazy and often quite annoying given Baruchel's weakling protagonist who sounds like only one ball has dropped. And with this comes the inevitable and familiar messages of acceptance and friendship. But ultimately, How to Train Your Dragon is a highly entertaining film, full of clever ideas, lovely, fluid aerial animation, and an exciting final battle with the giant dragon Red Death. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com", "Who knew? Fire-breathing dragons deep down inside are really touchy-feely creatures as long as you know how to train them right. That essentially is the premise of the much-acclaimed Dreamworks animated film, 'How to Train Your Dragon'. Of course there's a deeper message here (quoting the late Rodney King): \"Why can't we all get along?\". This is perhaps the first film I can remember where the great pillaging clan of Vikings are not pitted against human opponents and hence their reputation as a group of sadistic, murderous thugs is tempered by the aggression of their dragon antagonists. Leave it to the film's protagonist, Hiccup, the young nerdy son of the Viking leader, Stoick the Vast (curiously voiced by Gerard Butler, with a Scottish accent!), to teach his community an important lesson: it's better to use your brains instead of brawn. It takes a while for 'Dragon' to get going as the break into the second act doesn't occur until Hiccup begins nursing 'Toothless', the cute but hyperactive dragon (that he's responsible for injuring), back to health. Toothless looks like a leopard with wings but appears to have the temperament of a lovable canine. It turns out that the dragons have an excuse for all their bad behavior: they're beholden to a giant 'killer' dragon who the Vikings fear but who have never seen. Hiccup uncovers the mystery of this frightening behemoth when he flies into its lair after figuring out how to pilot Toothless, without falling off of him, in the air. Meanwhile back at the Viking village, Hiccup, much to his chagrin, is forced to participate in dragon training school with a coterie of fellow young misfits. Voiced by such comic luminaries as Jonah Hill and Kirsten Wiig, Hiccup's 'associates' all follow the 'macho' Viking line: kill the unpleasant dragons at any cost. Much of the antics of the youngsters are rather one-note, as they parrot the macho posturing of the community at large. Finally, Hiccup, through his sensitive handling of the out of control creatures, turns his colleagues around and trains them how to calm the dragons down, without killing them. The stakes are raised when Hiccup refuses to kill a dragon at the end of the training and his father disowns him. Stoick, raises an armada of his heavily armed Vikings, and with Toothless in tow (now chained on board the lead vessel), head out to the island where the big, bad monster awaits them. Leave it to Hiccup and his buddies to save the day by flying out to the island on board the formerly imprisoned dragons (back at the training school) and eliminate the monster in a rousing fight to the finish. With the bad dragon eliminated, the dragon population 'understands' that the Vikings are really on their side and are now quite amenable to being house trained. And of course, even macho Stoick, sees the light and ends up apologizing to his son. I suppose all this is an acceptable children's story but adults will feel a little less satisfied. If underneath, this is a tale about how humans treat animals, it's a rather fanciful conceit that leopards or tigers (which the dragons seemingly represent), can so easily be domesticated. If on the other hand, if the dragons represent a misunderstood group of humans (demonized by the Vikings who lack the insight into their nature), the fact that they ALL suddenly become peaceful (because they're now treated with 'sensitivity' by humans), hardly seems to reflect the reality of true human-to-human interactions. Throughout history, attempts to mollify belligerent peoples through appeasement, have resulted in disastrous consequences. In short, 'How to Train Your Dragon', is a feel-good tale, politically correct tale, best suited for children. Adults, however, will still be much impressed by the excellent, sumptuous animation, painstakingly created over a number of years by a group of highly talented animators. Whether the animation is enough for the viewer to overlook the rather lackluster story, is a matter of personal taste. For me, 'How to Train Your Dragon' is worth a look, decidedly for its impressive technical achievements, as opposed to its rather predictable narrative.", "How to Train Your Dragon is a fun but somewhat empty animated film. The film's premise is very inventive: a Viking's son who is reluctant to kill dragons befriends one and tames it as his own. The Viking's son is our narrator for the film. He is a plucky, very clumsy boy; one clich\u00e9 to start with. When he discovers the dragon he thought he killed in a field alive, he panics but eventually decides to train it. The movie is filled with visual splendor. The flight scenes of the protagonist riding the dragon Hiccup are so beautiful, brilliant, and amazing. However, the story itself is very thin. This film is a perfect example of style and visuals over substance; kind of like an animated version of Avatar. The first half of the film is wildly uneven and cluttered that you wonder how the screenplay wasn't edited. The second half is a vast improvement, especially with its epic climax and last emotional five minutes. As a whole, How to Train Your Dragon is more of a entertaining diversion than something totally memorable.", "DreamWorks studios has raised the bar for themselves and have proved themselves to be a visual competitor of Pixar Animations with their new film, How to Train Your Dragon. This animated gem with the voice talents of Jay Baruchel, and a comedic cast ensemble of voices, is one of the dazzling adventures to blaze the screen this 2010.  The film tells the story of little Hiccup, a young, small Viking who has been long trying to prove himself as a fierce warrior to his huge in mass father and village. When he finally captures one of the world's most ferocious breed of dragons, young Hiccup discovers a world, no Viking could have ever imagined. The screenplay by this five man and woman writing team is decent, though at times not as engaging as other CGI films that have ignited screens on fire for the past few years, it's an admirable step in the right direction for DreamWorks studios. It's leaps and bounds over last year's Monsters vs. Aliens, which wasn't half bad itself so I can appreciate the growth. The story is straight- forward, a bit predictable, and in its climax and bit heavy. As many have stated just by looking at the preview for the film, the visual sequences with the dragons and flying are some of the most beautiful shots seen on screen this thus far. For the majority of the film, the viewer can find himself/herself in utter awe at the color schemes and stunning work shown. ***/****", "How to train your dragon surprised me in every-way as an animated adventure.  Lately seeing these \"3D\" family fantasy / action / adventure films, I've been getting increasingly tired and bored as their efforts to \"marvel\" the audience with cuteness, humor and visuals have all started to blend together into each other becoming a bland mix of unoriginal entertainment.  These were my expectations walking into How to Train your Dragon, the main reason I wanted to see it was because I thought the dragon looked kind of cute on the posters and in the trailers, so I guess that's a huge WIN on the art designer's behalf :) At first I thought, this might be a cute and fun film. But within minutes I was sucked right into the experience. There were some moments were I felt honestly like crying and laughing, which for me is pretty uncommon these days in cinema. The story might be slightly familiar, and so may the characters. But don't be fooled! The style of this film is most original and creative and heart-warming and I would pay to see it again in 3D ten more times!  Regarding the 3D, I'd go right ahead and say it's just as good as Avatar in 3D. Forget Alice in Wonderland's 3D which was a joke, How To Train Your Dragon was MADE for 3D! On a final note: If you have not seen this film and you and your kids are into great films like Shrek, Finding Nemo, Wall-E or Avatar then please put \"How to Train Your Dragon\" on the to-watch list!", "I watched this film without having seen any trailers or heard about the movie after finding myself with a full Alice in Wonderland Monday showcase. I love animated films so I went along with my friend to this one instead. In the past Dreamworks pieces had made me yawn (with the exception of Kung Fu Panda and the Shrek series) and for starters the title and poster image made me think this was going to be a rather stupid movie. The fact that only 5 people, me included, where in the 10 p.m. showing didn't help to bring my expectations up. Boy was I wrong! The story follows a good crafted arch with a nice tempo, showcasing some of the most impressive and beautiful CG imaging I've seen. I don't feel like going into details about why I loved this film so much: most critics (which I've read after returning home) and other reviewers have done the job better than I could ever do. Suffice to say that characters, animation, art direction and plot are top notch, enough to make me write my first review on IMDb to encourage others to share the experience. Go take your kids or watch this one by yourself, specially in 3D like I did. It is simply a beautiful, fun and spectacular piece of work!", "This was a great film, a legendary kid (Hiccupp)who seems to be the odd ball of the viking bunch befriending a dragon known as a Night Fury. The most powerful of all dragons, with great speed, and fire power. The misconception that dragons are to be feared is a two sided coin. The belief of lore is that in these tales knights would fight and kill these dragons because of their killing sprees, albeit to feed themselves or their young. In fact most stories include dragons as friends to those who protect them. Vikings were one of them, they did fight, but in later tales, they worked with them as close friends to protect each other. But in this tale, Toothless (Night Fury) was one of the special dragons which helped Hiccup believe in himself to fight the most dreaded dragon of them all. A beast with such size and strength, it matches no other. Nearly two hundred feet tall, with an appetite that could match most sumo wrestlers. The gist of this story is most of the dragons raided villages only to feed this monstrosity, and in some ways most of the dragons feared it, being a personal slave to the behemoth. But as luck would have it, Hiccup and his gang of misfits manage to work with their dragons that they trained with in viking school, to finally be rid of the Dreadnaught dragon. Hiccup's father just needed to see it with his own eyes to believe that dragons are not the enemy, and never were. This film had everything, fun, action, laughs, and sadness which compels the human heart or for that matter, a dragons heart. I enjoyed it beginning to end. What a refreshing way to see how the young and old can come to grips with the misconceptions of those long past tales and how the confusion got started in the first place. Brilliant movie.", "Dreamworks has been getting better, haven't they? Overall? They've certainly learned from Pixar that a little bit of heart goes a long way in animated children's film-making. Unfortunately, a little bit of heart is all you really get in their latest, the Norse coming of age comedy, \"How to Train Your Dragon.\" The film is split into two tonally distinct sections: an intimate and charming boy-and-his- dragon friendship fable, and an exceptionally dull gladiatorial adventure film. It seems like nearly half of the running time is swallowed by a series of dragon defense training sequences with our hero, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), wowing a gaggle of cartoon stereotypes with his ability to tame the ferocious beasts without violence. There's seriously so many of these scenes that I keep thinking the name of the movie is \"How to Tame Your Dragon.\" The arena stuff doesn't do much to carry the plot; it just sort of peripherally shows the practical application of learning the softer side of dragons. And because the plot isn't really being advanced (the young Vikings are being trained while most of their village is out searching for a dragon hive), gags substitute for story, and wit is not the film's strong suit. Honestly, most of the characters feel shamelessly yanked from an animated who's who of the last decade. You've got the bickering siblings from \"The Incredibles,\" a protagonist not unlike Linguine of \"Ratatouille\" fame, and a couple of Shreks thrown in for good measure (or maybe that's just the Scottish accent). The supporting cast ultimately dilutes the simple maturity of film's central friendship, and sucks \"Dragon\" dangerously near the \"Shark Tale\" sinkhole. It's sort of like \"Up\" and the talking dogs. When you have something powerful, stick with it. Not every animated film has to be a 3D action/effects spectacle. Maybe this is a little greedy, but I'm not interested in going timeshare on \"How to Train Your Dragon.\" Give me \"Old Yeller\" or give me \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua.\" Fortunately, it's more the former than the latter. As kids films go, you could do a lot worse, but the divide that makes Pixar Pixar and Dreamworks Dreamworks is still firmly inset in \"Dragon's\" design philosophy. Pixar transcends the idea of making children's films, where Dreamworks embraces it, and while that's terrific for the target demographic, I don't think mom and dad are going to have as good a time as they did watching \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Monster's Inc.\" But Dreamworks is getting better at keeping the whole family entertained, and \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is among the very highest echelon of the studio's animated work, which probably partly accounts for its overwhelming praise via Rotten Tomatoes. Objectively however, it doesn't quite know who it's trying to please, and settles for a 'some of the people, some of the time' scenario that left me intermittently yawning. At its heart, there's a timeless companionship\u2014It just sometimes gets lost in favor of disposable entertainment. And that may be a backhanded complement, but it's a complement nonetheless. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is entertaining and sometimes touching, but doesn't quite overcome its kiddie stigmata, and the ADD child in me has already moved on.", "I am a huge fan of the book series, and I admit, I wouldn't have known about it if not for the movie. But that doesn't excuse it from being as horrible of an adaptation as you can get. The movie itself fairs pretty well. The animation is amazing, definitely Dreamwork's best work. The characters are well developed, though not all of them. The story is pretty okay, and the lesson is the best part (seeing as it is the only thing it kept from the book). I'd easily give it an 8. But as an adaptation this fails on so many levels. The whole point of the book series is that Hiccup is becoming a hero the hard way. The society he lives in values brawn, while Hiccup is only good at brains (well, until he learns he is awesome with swords, but that's besides the point). It is not until they learn that brains is valuable that Hiccup becomes a hero. I don't know this because that's how the book ends, this is merely hinted at. You know why? Because he never actually becomes a hero in the books. He saves Berk, but they still consider him useless for being good only in something not valued. His action doesn't change his person, they still think of him as the same. 10 books of near-death experiences and him saving everybody and he still doesn't become a hero. This is a great lesson: things are hard, and people are douches. You can't just instantly be great. It keeps it real. Hiccup wasn't born a hero, he learned how to be one. He isn't the \"dragon enchanter\"; he can barely keep his own dragon from starting a riot. The movie throws this out the window: one good deed and a leg and poof, you're the greatest person ever. The movie is saying that Hiccup is awesome, it's just that no one else can see that. That's not the point. As for the other things, the movie doesn't even try to keep the story, the characters are completely different (even Hiccup), and oh my god, you didn't need to add a love interest! Why? It's not necessary! It's not even the first time you did this (HHGTG)! Anyways, dragonese doesn't even exist, and there's so many missed potentials for great parts from the books to be turned into great scenes in a movie. Anyway, I think this movie is overpraised for taking a good book with a great moral and making it generic.", "Despite the rather predictable boy-and-his-pet story one of the better computer-animated Dreamworks vehicles. The character work is excellent and the pic's refusal to go for cheap laughs and pop-culture references in favour of a more thorough storyline is welcome. Still, there's a certain (logical and emotional) discrepancy between the cartoonish dragon-fights and the more somber moments. Technically, the vistas are simply dazzling and the 3D effects are imaginatively used, but the extra oomph is missing. 6 out of 10 lost legs", "\"You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. We have...dragons.\" How to Train Your Dragoni is a fairly typical, but fun, animated movie. It's not among the best that I've seen, but it's certainly entertaining enough to give a shot, especially if you have kids. The story is a blend of the usual stuff you get from these kinds of movies: the \"different\" hero who doesn't fit in, the love interest that's won over by the finale, and a misunderstanding to overcome and unite the dragons and Vikings by the end against a common threat. Some of the humor fell flat, but that's really the only criticism worth mentioning. The voice talent was very good, and the visuals were beyond good. All the unique designs for the different kinds of dragons were pretty cool, as well.\u00a0 Those things plus the pretty thrilling ending will keep adults from being bored, and kids will probably be sold from the very beginning. How to Train Your Dragon may not do anything new or exceptionally well, but it's a likable movie, nonetheless.", "It's April 2019 and HTTYD is on TV. I remembered I loved it when I saw it when it first came out with the kids (and a couple of times since) and thought \"I wonder if it still has its appeal?\" Answer... yes. The animation is beautiful (especially the flying scenes, the varied Dragon breeds and Toothless's facial expressions) but the storyline matches it... the evolution of Hiccups relationship with Toothless and the Viking clans relationship with ALL dragons, is perfectly done - never rushed, never forced and never kiddish/sickly (it's not all plain sailing). I won't go into too much detail in case you've not seen it but watch.... whatever your age. If you're a kid, you'll love it. But if you're an adult (or a grown up kid, like me), you'll appreciate the animation, the adventure, the characters, the lovely story. Be a kid again, enjoy. (P.S. I read Roger Eberts review before writing this as I always read his reviews... he was the best reviewer I've ever read. Its the first time I've thought he was wrong... gave it an \"ok\" review, maybe this wasn't his genre/thing).", "I went to go see this film with an open mind, & now I understand all the commotion about this film,I really like this film,I actually saw it twice with one of my friends, & he liked it also,I would have to consider it...Probably my Third favorite film of the Year(2010). Might see it again this week. But Here are my 2 Problems I had with this film #1. Some people said this film \"Made the people from \"Avatar\" Jealous\",That was one of my main reasons why I saw this film. Heres my concern,Avatar was made by a Genius name \"James Cameron\" who directed \"The Terminator\"(1984) while LIVING in his truck, & How to Train your Dragon was made by this guy who Thinks \"Farts\" are funny for kids, because he directed Shrek,I can't remember his name but this is like his third film,I think. But here's my point of view,Saying That How To Train your Dragon is better than Avatar is like The Second coming of God(Jesus Christ himself) while EVERYONE has there attention of the new \"Justin Bieber\" album. Don't get me wrong I like both films, but I think its unfair for that matter. #2. I think I already seen the Storyline somewhere, I think it was one of the the Pixar or Dreamworks films, You know where the \"Weak\" guy is in this group & he's trying to be better for himself, he gets into a relationship, then a fight & then at the end he \"Magically\" comes out as a hero, I think that storyline has already been used once to many times, its not a major problem, but I just think its time to grow up & time to stop living in the past,Ya know. Overral I give this film a 7.7/10", "A few years ago, Christopher Sanders (Lilo and Stitch) left Disney over a creative dispute with John Lasseter on a film that would eventually become Bolt. He crossed the street and visited Jeffrey Katzenberg, a former chairman at Disney, and together, with their middle fingers high in the air, made the best DreamWorks Animation movie since 2004's Shrek 2. How to Train Your Dragon tells the tale of Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), a teenage viking whose good at everything except being a viking. That disappoints his father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), the leader of the tribe. Stoick knows that he's not going to be around forever and fears that his son could not survive the constant attacks by dragons at their village. So, he enlists the help of Gobber (Craig Ferguson), his right-hand man, to teach the boy how to be a viking. Hiccup, however, has other plans. In secret he befriended a dragon and discovers that the animals are misunderstood and that they attack the village because someone (or something) is forcing them to. The film is heartwarming, funny, and exciting. The action scenes rival those of Pixar's The Incredibles. And a flight through the clouds with Hiccup trying to impress Astrid (America Ferrera), his crush, will remind audiences of Aladdin, a movie made during Katzenberg's reign at Disney. But a success similar to that film is unlikely. Warner Bros' decision to release Clash of the Titans in 3D only a week after this movie is going to cause a mess. Alice in Wonderland had three weeks to itself, so it was able to enjoy big success in the post-Avatar world but Dragons and Titans will remind Hollywood that most theaters aren't ready to make the transition. Hopefully, strong word-of-mouth will keep this film alive - even if it's only in 2D.", "Terrible. Certainly the front runner for the worst film I've ever seen. From the first to the last frame this film is as good as another film titled \"The Room\". Terribly written, designed and executed. Though bad, it's not quite awful - probably due to time and budget limitations (is there ever enough of either?).  That said, the good things i had are far too few to mention. If this film doesn't fail miserably at the box office, i'll lose faith in the entire world. Congratulations filmmakers, you made the worst animated film I have ever seen.", "Self absorbed Jewish guy beds Aryan Amazon. By being Self absorbed and well, just superior in being that. That's the gist of this movie. But it delivers this old tale in a very entertaining way. To me, this movie was more fun than most Woody Allen movies.", "A fun and educational movie. Film teaches animal love us. Film tales us the value of the different perspective of what is different in society. if we explain film by politic. if you eliminate 3-5 problems on the top that reveals hostility, everyone can live brotherly.", "There seems to be an abundance of terrible animated 'family' films around these days, all characterised by the same flaws; unnecessarily complex storylines, inappropriate adult themes, overwhelming cluttered CGI and sickly self-righteous characters. How To Train Your Dragon is free of most of these issues. It is an imaginative yet straightforward tale, appropriate for all ages and visually impressive without being chaotic. It is also a nice runtime of under 100 minutes, far more digestible than these baffling 2-hour marathons that today's ADHD generation of sugar-filled children have no chance of following. My main problem with animations is that it can be so difficult to connect with the characters. Hiccup is quite bland and cloying, churning out the usual clich\u00e9s and self-aware nerd humour. Astrid is equally one-dimensional and fails badly as a supposed love interest. The older Vikings are just stereotyped background fodder and don't add any depth to the story. As a result, I couldn't really get into this film and found it quite dull, despite the brilliant animation.", "Well it was a kinda good movie but the cartoon is not my type so that why so low", "This is a good movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It is a bit overrated. I would not say it is an 8.1. But still a good movie. 7 out of 10. How to Train your dragon 2 is better.", "The how to train your dragon franchise is amazing but the first one is and will always be the best one I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being totally blown away by the emotional depth and beauty of it the friendship between hiccup and toothless might be the most beautiful Friendship ever brought to screen and the father and son relationship in the film is extremely well done and emotional there are so many scenes in this movie that can make you shed a tear one of them being the romantic flight scene witch in my opinion is one of the most magical enchanting scenes in movie history. the characters are all fantastic and memorable and the voice acting Is great. the animation is Breathtakingly beautiful and so is the rest of the film. the score is absolutely incredible. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this movie it is without a doubt one of the most gorgeous emotional and beautiful animated movies of all time.", "Its one if my favorite movies, the friendship between toothless and hiccup is wonderful, the story is wonderful, the theme is wonderful, the characters are wonderful and the sequels maintain the quality if the first, they are worse but not very much its refreshing and the 3rd is heartbreakening that movie will make anyone cry at least one tear... and is a wonderful conclusion", "I am not why this movie is rated so high. Is it because of animation? This movie had predictable story, ordinary dialogues, hardly any funny moments or any thrill. This movie neither meant to be for kids nor adults. This is not 1990s where you can dazzle with graphics and animations.\nThe story felt like the writer wants to end the series for all and some how provide the reason why dragons vanished from earth. It also made dragons looks like slightly more advanced dogs or sometimes reptiles.", "There's a purity of vision in 'How To Train Your Dragon (2010)', one that sees it work incredibly well as a tightly-constructed, somewhat allegorical fable that has a strong central message. It focuses pretty much entirely on delivering this message, sometimes to the detriment of character and, even, story. All in all, it's kind of flat. Its world, and the people within it, are very two-dimensional and only change when the narrative needs them to. This, as I mentioned, serves its themes and, in a way, tightens its plot, but it does make things seem kind of surface-level. It's most noticeable with the father character; he feels like a caricature and, without spoiling anything, must be in contender for the 'worst dad of the year' award. Still, this overall dedication to theme makes for a focused experience that knows exactly what it's trying to achieve. For the most part, it achieves that. The 'all is lost' moment is very frustrating, which goes to show just how invested we are in our likeable protagonist's journey. This is helped by a fantastic soundtrack, which is probably the picture's greatest asset. The animation itself is decent but the actual rendering is slightly off. Most characters feel dead behind the eyes and, in some cases, it's kind of creepy; again, this is most notable with the father character. Still, the story is brought to life well enough and, during the flick's action set-pieces, the visuals often evoke a great sense of speed and spectacle while still conveying character, essentially, above all else. In fact, here character through action is often more successful than character through dialogue. The flick is entertaining, in general. It's not perfect, certainly, but it moves briskly enough that most of its issues come second to its integrity and overall fun. It's probably one of Dreamworks' better animated efforts, though it's certainly no 'Shrek (2001)'. 7/10", "With incredible action sequences and flight scenes, at its core it's really just a compassionate and relatable story about a father and son. Baruchel's unique and nasally voice perfectly fits the meekness of Hiccup, and Butler is wonderfully masculine and unsure. Also, it boasts one of the greatest traditional scores of the modern era, brilliantly repeating it's themes by modulating keys and forms where appropriate.", "While the plot arc is nothing original and quite predictable, the setting is an uncommon one and there are great moments, mostly in the third act. Many of the plot details seemed forced and lacking in depth. For example, the ease with which Hiccup made dragons who have been trapped and spent years fighting humans just surrender seemed unrealistic. Minor points, like the lack of clarity with whether or not Hiccup needed to be there to help him fly, or how they got Toothless to guide them, were not well explained. The relationship with the girl was quite token and predictable. However, I did really like the theme of confirmation bias and assuming other groups are enemies. The soundtrack is very good, and the climax is fun, if (like many parts of the movie) people acquiesce in a way that's convenient to the plot despite being contrary to who they seemed to be before. All in all, it's a good, fun family movie, but to me it didn't live up to the hype.", "Overall this is a fun and entertaining movie. I would highly recommend this one.  Animation - The animation in this movie is absolutely incredible. The creature design is fantastic.  Characters - A lot of these characters are pretty underdeveloped. Most of the plot relies on characters making dumb decisions. There are many points in this movie when I want to yell at characters for being idiots.  Plot - The plot is full of devices that make mad. There are so many instances in this movie where illogical things just happen to be convenient for the plot. There are lots of things that are set up and then later ignored. Overall the story is very entertaining but there is enough stupid in it holding it back from being as great as it could be. That doesn't mean that this movie isn't extremely entertaining. There's just a little too much nonsense for it to be as good as it could be.", "It is a one of the worst movies I have watched because first I am too old to watch it and secondly the animation is kind of poor but the music is amazing and in 3D is awesome. It is a great film to watch and my brother who is 9 years old and he watched it 5 times!!!", "This is Dreamworks animation best movie yet to come  That is one of the most interesting movies that you should see .  It's the kind of movie that gathers all the emotions together Friendship,Love,Happiness,Sadness,Exciting and fun. Also some other scenes that really make you smile from your heart . I can compare it with movies like Monsters Inc ,Finding Nemo Better than something like Mulan. It is better than other realistic movies too. I am not overrated don't hesitate watching it .  It deserves watching cause you will miss a great time. It is a 10 out of 10 masterpiece", "There was nothing too wrong with this movie (exciting plot, great animation, likable characters) but it failed to move me. Hiccup is a Viking teenager from the island of Berk. Unlike the tough, beefy men for whom fighting dragons is a way of life, Hiccup is lean and scrawny. He tries to live up to the community's expectations but fails miserably each time. His encounter with a dragon challenges him to see things from a different perspective and propels him to revolutionise his community.  I find the premise - that human beings were wrong about the nature of dragons for centuries - not quite believable. To be fair, we have been wrong about many things in the course of history, but to be so wrong about a creature that you encounter on a very regular basis pushes the limits of believability. It just seems so silly that no one realised that the dragons could be tamed/trained except a naive teenager. This fundamental problem is what marred my enjoyment of a movie that otherwise had a lot of things going for it.", "In 1982, Universal Pictures brought us E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. In 1999, Warner Bros. brought us The Iron Giant, by far my favorite 2D animated movie of all time. Next in a long line of a-boy-and-his-whatever stories was DreamWorks Animation's instant classic, How to Train Your Dragon. I was finally able to see this movie by myself on DVD on my XBOX 360 on Christmas Eve, and I loved it. This would now have to be my favorite DreamWorks animated movie ever. This visually incredible movie tells the story of a teenage Viking named Hiccup (played by Jay Baruchel) who is seen as kind of an outcast by his tribe. One night, Hiccup designs a device that can shoot down a dragon. And sure enough, the dragon he manages to catch is the Night Fury, the most mysterious and the most feared out of all of the other dragons. Hiccup is wandering through the woods the next day, and he finds the dragon still trapped in the net, and Hiccup attempts to kill this creature, but he can't bring himself to do it and instead frees him. From there, a friendship is formed, reminiscent of the relationship formed between Hogarth Hughes and a 50-foot-tall giant robot in The Iron Giant. Back in HTTYD, Hiccup actually learns that dragons are friends, not foes; and he also comes to realize that \"Everything we know about them (the dragons) is wrong.\" I thought this was a wonderfully done animated movie, and DreamWorks deserves either a pat on the back, a fist pound, or a round of applause. But there are some scenes in this movie that remind me of scenes from other animated movies. Like, for example, the opening scene where we first see the dragons attacking the village. That scene kind of reminded me of Titan A.E., when the Drej attack Earth and the people try to evacuate. There are a lot of scenes from How to Train Your Dragon that remind me much more of The Iron Giant. And Hiccup, to me, looks very much like a teenage Hogarth Hughes that, when he was still the young nine-year-old kid we all know him as, must've slipped through a wormhole and went back in time to the time of Vikings and Dragons and sort of became this character over about seven or eight years. There are some other great characters in this movie, like Gerard Butler plays Hiccup's dad, Stoick the Vast. America Ferrera kicked butt and took names as Astrid. Jonah Hill, only about eight months before he starred as the bad guy in Megamind, is at his comedic best as Snotlout. I also noticed that Christopher Mintz-Plasse (aka McLovin') lent his voice to this project as Fishlegs. T.J. Miller and Kristen Wiig are also in this movie as the twins, Ruffnut and Tuffnut, who are comical and sassy, but still very funny. Oh, and don't forget Craig Ferguson plays Gobber, Hiccup's mentor at the blacksmith shop and of course, I guess you can say, he is also a \"teacher\" at Dragon Training class. P.S.; How come all these Vikings have Scottish accents? That really makes no sense to me, but still... Overall, I thought that this movie was visually stunning, and I think if I would've wanted to see this movie when it was first out in theaters back in March, I would've seen it in 3D because it just would've been cool to see it in this big format. How to Train Your Dragon is not just a movie for kids, but it's also something that the entire family will enjoy. Go ahead and buy or rent this movie on DVD and watch it with your family. I promise you won't be disappointed once you see it. This movie will make you laugh, make you cry, and it'll keep you on the edge of your seat, especially near the end. This movie is, in a word, \"amazing.\" It's by far, to me, the single best animated movie that DreamWorks has done, and I hope they have the same thing for the sequel, which is scheduled for release in 2014. This animated movie \"soars\" over any other 3D animated movie ever made, and I recommend it to anybody, parents and children alike, who wants to be blown away just like I was.", "How To Train Your Dragon is up there as one of the best animated movies ever made. My only qualm is that title of the movie can put off adult viewers, but I guess that's the drawbacks of adapting. I didn't watch this movie till much later, having presumed from the title that it'd be a kids' movie. Straight up, this movie has enough depth and logic to engage with adult viewers. But what makes this film stand out is its flawless portrayal of tear-jerking values of bravery, courage and faith. The story is brought along very well whilst at all times hanging on to the intrigue of its viewers. The movie is cleverly written and the characters are brought to the fore fairly well. The actors voicing the characters all do a good job presenting the animated characters to audiences. Now. Here's what's truly outstanding about this movie - the incredible & mesmerizing soundtrack by John Powell. I wasn't surprised to learn that this score got nominated for an Oscar. Two particular tracks from the OST stand out in particular - Test Drive and Forbidden Friendship. You'd be jamming to these long after seeing the movie. The movie was very good, but the genius of John Powell's soundtrack is what makes this movie absolutely amazing.", "The animated movie How to Train Your Dragon is about a young boy named Hiccup born in a sturdy village, a place where survival is maintained by defending the village against attacking dragons. All the people of the village try to showcase their mettle by fighting big, strong dragons. Hiccup's father is one the strongest and the chief of the village, while on the contrary Hiccup is clumsy, lacks courage and messes things very badly. His father thinks that he is not capable enough for fighting the dragons although he aspires to be one the greatest.  The other big element around which the movie revolves is a dragon named \"Night Fury\", which is the most evasive dragons of all and none of the villagers have ever killed a Night Fury and aspire for the same. It turns out that Hiccup, as a matter of chance, manages to hit a Night Fury far from the village one night using one of his gadgets. No one in the village believes of him hitting a Night Fury . So, he goes alone in the search of the dragon and his search ends with finding the Night Fury he hit and it finally becomes a turning point of his life. They eventually become friends and his whole thinking about dragons change. No one in the village knew about this friendship of Hiccup with a Night Fury and ultimately when everyone finds out, the two notions: Hiccup's friendship with a dragon as opposed to the villagers fighting dragons for their survival were at state of conflict. Watch the movie to find out is this friendship going to change the views of the villagers or will Hiccup have to leave the village? And what happens next? The animation is awesome with diverse characters and dragons. The movie is fun and enjoyed by everyone from kids to adults. Although the idea of the movie is simple, the display and the way the movie unfolds is worth watching.", "I watched this movie when it first came out, and I enjoyed it. It was nice to see dragons and humans bonding together when. The bond the people formed with the dragons was heartwarming, in my opinion. This is a kids flick, so adults would probably find it boring. Though, some adults may actually find it enjoyable to watch. However, most children would and should like this film. The way the characters developed was nice to see. It was stupid and funny. There was a really strong bond between each and every character in the movie. This bond got stronger over time, which was great to see! I definitely recommend this movie to children.", "This is my favorite movie. I love all the characters. Hiccup doesn't have typical teenage problems he just wants approval in his village. The dragons are all done beautifully. The relationship between Hiccup and Astrid was not dwelt upon and they kept to the task at hand. You don't have to like the movie but I think everyone should at least give it a try. While some people don't like that the adults have accents but the kids don't I find that it symbolizes that the kids brought the change to the village. The twins were an excellent addition to what I call los seis amigos dragones (the six dragon friends). They were funny and Tuffnut is in my top three favorite characters. Overall this was a great movie that I never get tired of no matter how many times I see it.", "It is a damn shame DreamWorks Animation had to be the one to step up and fill the Viking movie void. C'mon, studios. That said, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is one hell of a movie and worth any wait involved. And it's not just Vikings, but also adventure movie . . . everybody learns something here, but they keep things light. It's loaded with heart, memorable characters and beautiful animation (I'm sure the flying scenes were pretty cool in 3D). The sentiment's genuine, the humor razor sharp; it's got an impressive cast, a heartwarming story and It's just a lot of fun. It's not every day you find a modern animated movie so well-packaged. 8/10", "It was a matter of time before an animated film centered around fire-breathing dragons. What's to blame? Everybody loves dragons! Sadly, Dreamworks animation fails to create any source of beautiful animation and keeps giving off cheap laughs to entertain kids and families. A hapless young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed. Oh boy, never heard of that one before. The recycled elements of family-encoded fun feel tired and unoriginal in \"How to Train Your Dragon.\" The dragons are well-done for animation, but the rest of the film looks very awkward and has no ounce of creativity. Pixar and other forms of heartfelt animation have got everything on Dreamworks. The feel-good quality is moving if your a parent or under-appreciated child, but for the most part you'll be able to see all the humor and plot twists coming in every direction. Why be hard on an animated kids film? Because this genre has created some of the greatest films to date. In recent years, \"Up,\" \"Fantastic Mr.Fox,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and the \"Toy Story\" films have not only made audiences laugh and cry, but has the ability to consume the finds and have the stories stick with you forever. A big budget, popular voices including Gerard Butler, and a gigantic studio behind it, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" has no excuse for cheap animation. There's just nothing interesting or visually mesmerizing about this. Hell, the 3D looks like it was used just for one scene to try and compete with \"Avatar.\" I'm sure almost everyone who see's it will love this film. Too bad we couldn't have audiences feel the same about a different movie that was actually good!", "I really had no expectations the first time I saw this film. Frankly, based on the trailers I'd seen I thought it was going to be fairly hokey and formulaic. Imagine my surprise when I found it to be a funny, heartfelt and action-packed movie for kids.  How to Train Your Dragon tells the story of \"Hiccup\" (voiced by young Jay Baruchel, but who I would have sworn was Christian Slater), a skinny, quirky pre-teen growing up in a Viking village. He's clumsy, intellectual and prone to inventing things using the crude technology available at the time. The village is a harsh place to live and the Vikings are portrayed as big, beefy, hearty men and women who have to fight not only the elements but invasions of attacking dragons, which they've fought for generations. The Vikings in the village define their lives through their battles against the dragons, and Hiccup's father (Stoick, voice by Gerard Butler) is the biggest and bravest of them all \u2013 and the leader of the village. He thinks Hiccup is not cut out for dragon-battle despite Hiccup's desire for just that very thing (motivated in great part because he believes it'll get him a girlfriend). Hiccup is mesmerized by Astrid (America Ferrera), a blonde warrior in training who can hold her own against the boys her own age with whom she is training. There are many, many types and varieties of dragons here, but the most elusive one \u2013 that not only has anyone ever seen, much less killed, is the mysterious and super-fast Night Fury. Hiccup uses one of his gadgets to bring down the Night Fury far from the village. Of course no one believes him, and he goes out in search of the deadly dragon. I won't say much more than of course Hiccup finds it (he names it \"Toothless\" for reasons that are apparent) and the film is basically about how they come to be friends. From Toothless Hiccup learns how to train dragons and appears to subdue them in dragon battle training. I was concerned that the audience would be bludgeoned with some sort of \"message\" in this film, but instead I found the story to be uplifting and the message more subtle than that of Avatar \u2013 a film that this reminded me of with the scenes involving dragon flight and a battle towards the end. Yes, for the most part you'll know where this story is headed, but they actually managed to turn the story in a direction I didn't expect at all \u2013 something I can't say about the aforementioned other film. I found the CGI animation to be very detailed, although a little more expressiveness in the characters' faces might have been nice. I particularly enjoyed Gerard Butler's performance \u2013 loved hearing him speak any time his character was on screen. Although you'll know where things are headed between Hiccup and Toothless and between him and Astrid, I felt the movie took its time getting there and didn't make it too easy for the inevitable transitions to take place. Toothless was a joy to watch \u2013 they made him a cross between the best aspects of a dog and a cat as far as personality and he was completely lovable. Overall I found How to Train Your Dragon to be great fun with a big heart \u2013 it drew me in and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Feel free to bring kids of all ages to this one, nothing in it is inappropriate or so scary that it would give the little ones nightmares. Personally, I look forward to seeing it again every time I pop it in on DVD", "ow to Train Your Dragon is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated action- fantasy film by DreamWorks Animation loosely based on the British book series of the same name by Cressida Cowell. The film was directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, the duo who directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch. It stars the voices of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. His progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Gerard Butler) is chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon- fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking, but when he befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.", "The animation is SPECTACULAR, and so is the soundtrack, and there are some very amusing moments. However, there is a great deal of violence - well, more the THREAT of violence - which I find inappropriate in a children's movie. Look - \"101 Dalmatians\" had plenty of that threatened violence, too, but in \"Dragon,\" we actually SEE the boy brandishing a knife, hear him trying to talk himself into killing the dragon and removing the heart to give to his father. (You KNOW that won't happen, but the concept is way too scary for a young child, IMHO.) Yes, I know I tend to be a wuss about these things, and standards are rapidly changing, but I would have rated it PG-13.", "Ciaran: How to train your dragon is up in the top 10 animated movies of all time for me. I just love this movie, it takes an over used storyline and paces it into a brilliant film and then mixes it with good actors, experienced directors and perhaps the greatest animation viewed in 3D of all time. From start to finish how to train your dragon shows how tradition changes and the world is ever changing, there are many messages that can be drawn out of the movie such as an environmental statement, one with animals or in the case of the movie- one with dragons. You could praise this movie so much, but what stands out for me is the constant WOW moments i experienced whilst watching this movie, the visuals and the angles just made me feel as if i was riding the dragon or fighting off the dragons, i felt immersed in the world the animators had created, and that is a very large accomplishment. Even though the plot line has been used a million times before the pacing and twist on the plot supplied to us by the directors makes How to Train your Dragon all the more enjoyable. To conclude i really would like to see more of the world of How to train your dragon, i look forward to the new sequel, but i just hope this film isn't ruin but its successor.", "The good thing about \"how to train your dragon\" is that its not interesting only for the children but for adults too. The story: Hiccup, a young Viking lives at the village of Berg, which is terrorized by dragons. Hiccup wants to become a dragon slayer like his father, but when he finds a black injured dragon in the forest, he cant bring himself to kill him. In time, he and the dragon, toothless, become friends; a friendship that will change their world for ever. Fortunately the animation effects are great and very vivid, helping with the development of the action and keeping the audience entertained. The story is great too, an adventure with high flights and viking battles. Great movie.", "Approaching the film as an independent story, with no ties to the How to Train Your Dragon books, it's a well-made, appealing animation. The plot is a little formulaic, with no demanding characters or twists. As a movie for kids, it works well. The music and visuals are very impressive. In regard to the books, the film discards the vast majority of the source material (from the first book alone), except for the cosmetic setting details, and names. It completely abandons the heart of the books, which was a very different dynamic between the main characters. Some characters are represented by name, in the animation, but are not recognizable; another is invented to fill a recycled plot requirement. I feel it would be more accurate to describe the movie as inspired by the books, as no real effort is made to adapt them directly, which is a real shame.", "Certainly one of the better non-Pixar computer animated efforts. It tells a tried and tested story of friendship overcoming great odds. It's a bromance version of Romeo and Juliet.Despite the fairly obvious plot, How to Train Your Dragon excels at minor details. When the disappointed father declares \"I have no son!\" It's genuinely painful and believable. The overall outcome takes a brave and mature turn, making it very authentic. For me, there was a bit too much dialogue. The best parts were the montage moments between Hiccup and Toothless, which reminded me of that quiet simplicity in Wall-E. This is highly entertaining stuff for the family and avoids being patronizing in any way. The ending is also extremely exciting, even by today's action obsessed world.", "Released the same year as Toy Story 3 it was obvious this film would never win the Oscar against its biggest rival, I had to see if it was worthy however of the nomination, so I watched it. Basically long ago,set in the time of the Vikings, on the Island of Berk, the townspeople are being continuously raided by large, flying and some fire-breathing dragons, young Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Jay Baruchel) wants to join the fight against them. But he is small and clumsy, he does however have an ability for inventiveness, village leader, and his macho father Stoick the Vast (300's Gerard Butler) however will not allow him to join. To prove himself to his father and the rest of the village that Hiccup can fight and does want to kill a dragon he ventures out and manages to hit the most sought after and most feared dragon of all, the mysterious unseen Night Fury dragon. He approaches the dragon trapped on the ground and tries to bring it within himself to kill it, so he lets it go, and he returns later to find the dragon still hanging around, looking for him. Hiccup names this dragon Toothless, fixes his tail, and he finds that he has an ability to communicate with him, and other dragons also. So when father Stoick is believing he is ready to start training to kill a dragon, obviously this comes in useful as he manages to fend off a dragon rather than hurt it, much to the annoyance of Astrid Hofferson (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera). Hiccup knows that many of the legends of the dragons are wrong, they are misunderstood creatures, they only raid the village for food to feed the much bigger source of their kingdom, they are actually a friendly species. For a while the villagers and those training to fight the dragons are fooled into thinking the young Viking is somehow able to scare dragons away, but seeing his dragon and finding out the truth is not very good. In the end however Hiccup proves himself against the biggest threat as he and Toothless fight against it, the villagers see that dragons are indeed not to be feared, and all live in harmony. Also starring Craig Ferguson as Gobber the Belch, Jonah Hill as Snotlout, Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs, Kristen Wiig as Ruffnut, T.J. Miller as Tuffnut, Ashley Jensen as Phlegma the Fierce and David Tennant as Spitelout. The characters of young dragon-whisperer Hiccup, his quite feisty father Stoick, of course the friendly Toothless and many others really add to the mix, the story is pleasant and easy to follow, and the special effects do create exciting and terrific scenes, a most watchable family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for John Powell and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!", "When my friend told me I had to watch this, my immediate response was \"I'll pass thanks\". I'm very glad she forced me into it anyway. I've heard people say that the plot was boring, clich\u00e9d and predictable. Okay so it was predictable, we all knew the kid and the Dragon were going to become friends. After all, it's called \"how to train your Dragon\" not \"how to eat your human\", but it was by no means boring. Clich\u00e9d? Well yes, the plot line isn't new (social reject becomes friends with the enemy, changes underlying social order and the world becomes a better place). We've all seen it before, but then again it is a kid's movie and no one ever condemns the classic fairy tales for having the same plot (mistreated girl escapes cruel mother figure, meets prince, lives happily ever after). The movie was captivating enough for its lack of originality to be forgiven. What was troubling about this movie however was not its lack of originality but the underlying message. The main idea behind this film is that we should accept those who are mean to us as opposed to killing them for stealing our sheep. That's all well and good, don't judge a book by its cover and all that, but what happens when you try to train your dragon and rather than being a loyal steed it bites your hand off and gives you a face full of flames? It is just a piece of lighthearted entertainment, but the idea that being nice to the bully will always make him go away is a flawed one at best.  Other than that though, this movie was a vast deal better than I expected. The humour was great (I got a few giggles out of it anyway) and the animation spectacular. Not quite Wall-E spectacular, but certainly impressive in its own right. The characters were lovable and well voiced even though Vikings didn't really have Scottish accents. The relationship between the dragon and the Hero was very well developed and triumphantly heartwarming during the action packed climax. The verdict therefore: a charming movie, not to be taken too seriously but ultimately very entertaining. You really do need to learn how to train your dragon.", "I had no expectations to see this film as it wasn't my cup of tea at first as I am a lover for fairytale films like Tangled,The Little Mermaid etc so when I got this for a bargain yesterday I decided to buy it and watch it last night. The story is set in medieval times and its about a boy named Hiccup who befriends a dragon named Toothless whom he met in the woods as he was tied up in ropes. Hiccup's father is a viking and he is a dragon slayer and wants his son to follow in his steps. Of course what his father doesn't know is that his son doesn't want to kill dragons as he knows more on dragons than anyone else. The film itself was quite dark and not as colorful yet it was brilliantly well done. The story was good and the animation was breathtaking I loved the scenaries in this film where Hiccup and Toothless ride of in the auora lights at night along with Hiccup's love interest Astrid voiced by America Ferrea,the voice cast was unknown yet I knew America Ferrara who was in Ugly Betty as Betty, and(Jay Bucumel who I think was in The Sorcecers Appretience with Nicolas Cage back in 2010), I knew David Tennant from Dr Who as I used to watch that TV series before Matt Smith took his place. 9/10", "I've seen this movie a couple of times now, all of them in normal 2D since I think every movie should be judged by its basic format free from any gimmick. I really liked this movie a lot, although there are a couple of aspects that were a setback to me which I'm gonna list below. First of are the clich\u00e9's, How To Train Your Dragon has a lot of clich\u00e9's particularly in its characters; you have the tough girl that everyone likes, the aggressive bully, the nerdy fat kid, the annoying 'funny' twins. These are all things that regular movie-goers probably won't mind, but for me they felt kind of tiresome and I felt that it didn't add a lot to the overall picture, nor do I feel that any of them were particularly funny or entertaining as characters. The other thing that I didn't really like was the voice of our main protagonist Hiccup (Jay Baruchel). This is somewhat a hit or miss, because he does seem to do a pretty good job with the voice, and at times he does come across like he's having a good time but to me his nasally voice gets a bit irritating. But this is just a minor personal preference. The voice-cast overall is pretty damn good though, if you can at least appreciate the humour of vikings with over the top Scottish accents. These are the few downsides of the movie, but How To Train Your Dragon luckily has a lot of entertainment to offer. To begin with, the visuals are great. Particularly the flying-scenes are easily the highlight of the movie, which I think most people would agree with me. Besides that, the movie has just the right pacing, giving us good insight into the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. The creators also avoided turning this into a typical love-story which I liked, and the ending is spectacular to say the least. How To Train Your Dragon is a excellent movie for the entire family like you would expect from a company like Dreamworks. Well worth the money and time.", "I have a pet cat, called The Cat. I do not have a pet dragon. Therefore, i see no point in this film teaching me about a pet dragon. As far as I am concerned, no-one on my street has a pet dragon. This is mainly down to the cost. I suggest a more helpful film such as how to teach your dog to sit, or How to seduce women without offending them, or injuring them. Something that involves everyday life. I'm not from the middle ages and do not need advice on a dragon. Im George Gorton, not St. George. Besides from that, i felt that the relationship between the boy and the dragon was a symbolism for communism and had hints of homosexuality, something i found disturbing and would imagine my children would. Don't let this communist, faggot ridden film penetrate our minds. This is propaganda at the highest level.", "I must confess that, initially, I wasn't that attracted to this movie, but after watching it I wonder why I wasn't! This is the story of Hiccup, a young uncool spaghetti-thin Viking guy, his toothless mysterious dragon, and their relationship and adventures. This movie is more than 3D animation and special effects. It is entertaining, funny and delicious to watch. The script is robust and original without being cheesy, the emotional drawing of the characters is powerful, the animation and color are great and very detailed (I was mesmerized by how real the hair of Hiccup looked and the wonderful design of the dragons), the action scenes are magic and marvelous (one feels that is really flying and in the spot, the scenes of training and learning truly delicious. The humor is not as witty and naughty as in the Pixar movies, but this is a funny movie without being simplistic, and the viewer laughs and smiles easily, almost without wanting to. I loved the Scottish accent of the dwellers of the Viking village, but I was shocked by the broad American accent of Hiccup and other kids in town. I mean, the fact that they are younger and different doesn't turn a broad Scottish into an American accent by magic. A softer Scottish accent could have been better and more credible. But this is truly me being picky. I loved the movie. When the movie ended I wanted more, as I was in love with Hiccup and Toothless!", "Well done, DreamWorks. When you set your mind to it, you can create good animation films, despite being under the gigantic shadow of Pixar most of the time. How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent and enjoyable film with Vikings and Dragons, mixed with good, pure humour, thrilling, jaw-dropping actions scenes and chases \u2013 on dragons, of course. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a Viking who is so not a Viking. He's that puny, stick figure in comparison to his disappointed and huge, buff dad, Stoick (voiced by Gerard Butler) who also happens to be the village's chief. Hiccup can't kill dragons to save his life. But what he does instead is accidentally catch the most powerful and deadly dragon in history, a Night Fury, and befriends it. He feeds him fish (no eel), makes a harness and trains him to fly while riding on his back. It's your typical story, and the dragon flying scenes are almost mirror images of Avatar's grandiose scenes; Hiccup is that weakling and underdog, yet it's just human nature to cheer him on. Along the way we want to see him defy the odds and succeed against everybody's expectations. Quirky and fun, this extremely well-made animation teaches a great lesson for kids: don't be afraid to be yourself and believe that you can achieve great things. Of course, it's just as entertaining for adults, and along with Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks has struck gold with another animated masterpiece.", "I'm not a huge fan of Dreamworks. Nothing personal, but none of their films have really interested me. I've only seen two, so I'm not working off of much, but the first one I watched (Over the Hedge, for any of you who are wondering) was a waste of time. So, while I was looking forward to watching How to Train Your Dragon, my expectations weren't very high. Quite frankly, I wasn't sure what to expect. However low my expectations were, I was pleasantly surprised. The story was interesting, though not as good as most Pixar films, and the quality of the animation wasn't bad, despite the highly stylized people. The Story: The film is set in a Viking village with a serious pest: dragons! The dragons have an inconvenient habit of attacking the village at night and carrying of the village's food supply. The villagers fight back, attempting to kill as many dragons as possible. The young hero of the film, Hiccup, attempts to help fight dragons, but is told to stay inside and out of the way, despite this, he runs out and joins in the fight, and even manages to shoot down one of the most dangerous of all the dragons! Unfortunately, no one believes him when he claims to have done it, so, the next morning, yet set out to find and kill his dragon. To cut a long story short, instead of killing the dragon, he befriends it, and finds out that everything his village knows about dragons is wrong. In the end, the village finds out that Hiccup was right, they are able to set free the enslaved dragons, and everybody lives happily ever after. The Bad: The story is set in a pagan viking culture, which poses some obvious problems. There are multiple reference to praying to the viking gods, which, as Christians, we know to be wrong. At the beginning of the film, the son's relationship with his father is very poor, with multiple instances of disrespectfulness, which the film usually portrays in a humorous light. Fortunately, this relationship improves toward the end of the film, giving the impression that the father and son will grow closer as time passes. The relationships between the \"teenage\" vikings also is rather poor, though in the end, they too work together for the good of the village. There are also a couple of sexual innuendos and a few kisses between the hero and heroine. The Good: The entire theme of the story was redemption. The viking's need was to stop the raids from the dragons, which could only be accomplished by freeing (or redeeming) the dragons from the even bigger dragon that enslaved them. The story also dealt with motives, and the need to have good ones. At the beginning of the story, the vikings kill dragons because they \"are vikings, and that's what vikings do.\" Hiccup is the first person to stop and think about whether or not that was really a good enough reason to kill them, and in the end, they find out it's not. The film also provides an example, albeit a rather poor one, of a father and son growing closer as the work together towards a common goal. Conclusion: While the story was enjoyable, it does have some major problems. This film is only suitable for discerning audiences, and I can't say it's high up on my list of recommended films to watch.", "I like this movie, it is very fine. But at all there's nothing \"new\" from Shrek or other anim-movies. Is's more like fairytale than adventure. Maybe it was meant for, but I do not like that \"straight\" access, total flat characters etc. You know, it is perfectly \"kli\u009a\u00e9\" movie, main character is weak, his father is the most powerful man of world -- but unfortunately very conservative. There's one strong guy, one stupid guy, one ugly guy, one normal girl, one special girl (in which main character is secretly in love with, but she acts like stupid one...), there's dragons of many levels, the most powerful are the most nice ... I think it is really nothing special, just because this. No special access to story, no special characters, only ... \"for sure\" ;)  And I am sad, because this movie should be better, the main story is not bad at all, characters neither. But whole complex thing is just mud and dust, I am afraid. :-/", "In a small Viking village beset by dragons lives a young boy named Hiccup (Jay Baruchel). His father is Stoick (SP?) (Gerard Butler), and Hiccup is the apprentice to local armourer Gobber (Craig Ferguson), who would be in battle himself were it not for his missing arm and leg. Hiccup dreams of one day becoming a famous dragon slayer, just like his dad, only he is too weedy and nervous, something his father is aware of and embarrassed by. In a desperate attempt to be noticed by both his Father and a young girl named Astrid (America Ferrera) Hiccup actually manages to hit a dragon with a lucky shot, but of course no-one sees him - and more importantly no-one believes him. Desperate to prove himself to all Hiccup goes looking for the evidence of his kill, only much to his surprise he finds that his target was only winged. In a tense scene Hiccup decides not to kill the wounded shiny black axylotl-looking beast, and instead frees it. From this point on he swears off dragon killing. So of course Hiccup gets home to find that his Dad, against his better judgment has enrolled him in the local dragon killing training session, held by none other than Gobber. There, alongside other similar aged, but far more brutal and bloodthirsty teens (in a PG 13 way of course), Hiccup is taught that dragons are to be feared, and when in a position to do so will ALWAYS go for the kill. Having only recently finding this not to be the case Hiccup is skeptical, and decides he must find out exactly why his encounter didn't end with him gone and the dragon reaching for a toothpick. With his Father and most of the village's adults away on a voyage to find the main dragon's lair and eradicate the menace, Hiccup consults the good old \"Encyclopedia of Dragons\", only he can't find one which describes \"his\", and it seems that the only way to deal with such beasts is continually \"kill on sight\". So Hiccup goes back to his dragon, who for some reason he has named Toothless despite clear evidence to the contrary, and he identifies that without fixing the dragon's tail, he is a sitting duck, so to speak. There are some really good scenes with Hiccup and Toothless getting to know and become comfortable with each other, (and thankfully the dragon doesn't talk and spout catchphrases), and the early flight sequences are really cool. Also back at the village Hiccup is able to use some of his \"pet\" knowledge to subdue the ferocious beasts used for training purposes, and with his new skills he becomes a local celeb \"Dragon Whisperer\", and ultimately wins the \"Class of 1256 Dragon Slayer of the year\" award, which gives him the privilege of killing an actual dragon in front of the whole village. Things get more complicated when love interest Astrid discovers his secret, and more complicated still once his Father realizes that he can use Hiccup's knowledge to track down the big Daddy dragon. So Hiccup must decide if he is a dragon killer, or to go public with his knowledge that dragons can be quite harmless and tame. What might he choose? Hint; this is still a PG film. Final Rating \u2013 7 / 10. Definitely more intense than most animated films, I think 11 + will get a lot out of this. (15 + will watch Kick-Ass.)  If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com", "A splendid plot that narrates on the tale of the endless struggle between dragons and vikings. The animation, story, characters, morals, voices and everything else are all perfect. Then the 3D enhances it's beauty. Dreamwoks' heartwarming themes and spirited actions will never get old for all ages. Most people will enjoy this film from the beginning to the end. This doesn't have any dull moment and everything falls into a substance. There's plenty of breathtaking action between dragons and vikings! This film will entirely change your views about dragons, on how they're pictured as a simple savage fire breathing beast. But just what the title says, The only bad thing about DreamWorks is that it's really predictable, but I'm not saying that adults won't enjoy it too! I think that there are only two things about this film that I didn't see coming. But everything else is perfect.", "I thought this movie would be terrible at first, but I was dead wrong. How to Train Your Dragon may not have been on Toy Story 3 level, but it was great considering it wasn't PIXAR. The characters were better than I thought they'd be, the film had a charm to it, and it was an overall great experience. It felt like it had a video game charm to it for some reason. I can't put my finger on why that is. I used to love N64 and the games on it. For some reason, How to Train Your Dragon felt like a 90s spirited movie that had an animated charm as well as a video game charm. It had a Dreamworks film charm to it obviously. It made up for the studio's last disappointing effort \"Monsters vs Aliens\". That's one of the things that put me off the movie at first. The title, How to Train Your Dragon, it sounded like a stupid name for a stupid movie. That's one thing Dreamworks needs to improve: the titles of their works. What next: \"Gandma Had To Go Abduct an Alien\" or \"Lawyers vs Hippies\" or \"High, I forgot How To Make a Not So Long Movie Title\"? Besides that flaw the movie was great. I hope the sequel is equally as good or even better. Move over Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon is here to stay.", "I missed HTTYD in its theatrical release, but being the animation enthusiast that I am, and having heard some positive reviews, I was happy to see the film on DVD. My modestly positive expectations were greatly surpassed. My first impression was that the visuals were exceptional; the night shots of the village and the contrast with fire from the dragons' attack was very impressive. The animators managed to do a very good job of rendering the clear, crisp feeling of a cold, starry night. The level of detail was remarkable; textures of rough, weathered wood and battered metal looked very authentic. The story is very familiar; essentially \"local goofball makes good\". So, being that we've all seen it before, why is it so good here? That technical excellence helps; this really feels like a world we haven't really seen before, but it's rendered gorgeously. Lush forests are contrasted with forbidding rocky coasts. The characters are great too; Jay Baruchel makes the central character Hiccup sound sufficiently nebbishy, and is ably supported by Gerard Butler as Hiccup's imposing father Stoick and Craig Ferguson as Cobber. When the story opens, Hiccup's home island of Berk is being attacked by marauding dragons. Hiccup is not the most manly of Berk's inhabitants, and is beset by a tendency to daydream. He has created a device that he believes will help bring down the attackers, and sneaks out to try it in battle. It works--Hiccup knows he's brought something down but it lands too far away for him to investigate--but the unintended consequences cause considerable damage. Hiccup's father Stoick is clearly disappointed. When Hiccup goes out the next day to try to find what he might have brought down, he finds a dragon that no one has ever seen before; a dreaded Night Fury. But its tail is injured, and it cannot escape the sinkhole where it landed. Hiccup comes to name his find \"Toothless\", and the relationship they build is central to the film. Toothless is an amazingly-imagined creature who expresses an incredible range of emotions over the course of the story. As Hiccup gains Toothless' trust, he learns far more about dragons as a species than his fellows at home ever knew. So, more clich\u00e9, Hiccup befriends Toothless, trains him in secret, and eventually becomes the first human to actually RIDE a dragon. But this process is told so convincingly and beautifully that it comes across very naturally. The story has some nice twists, too, like when Hiccup discovers that the dragons are not merely stealing the villagers' food for their own sake. There are great messages in the film. The usual \"be true to yourself\" stuff, sure, but deeper ones about trust and loyalty as well. They all come organically out of the story, rather than feeling imposed. Ever since the original Shrek, I knew that Dreamworks could compete with Pixar when they really felt like it. The journey's been uneven but they've continued to produce some very good work on occasion. This movie, though, is maybe the first one that can be considered with Pixar's very best movies. The next Oscars in 2011 may finally see an animated film win as Best Picture; How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story 3 are both good enough to be contenders. With its dazzling technical merits, its well-written story and its great, original characters, I think I'd vote for the dragons.", "In one of the \"Goofs\" they say that \"some of the runes are backwards..\" If anyone does a bit of research into Keltic-Hunnic Runes than you would see that what you call \"Correct Runes\" are actually the 'Right Handed' way of writing them and what you call \"Backward Runes\" are actually the more commonly used Hunnic or 'Left Handed' way of writing them. Even till today in Transylvania and parts of Hungary there are people who still use them and they prefer the 'Left Handed' writing style even though they write it with right hand. It's due to it mostly being carved into wood or a wooden walking/herding stick by a pocket knife and if you would take your time and tried it you would discover that it's MUCH easier to carve right to left and using the left handed runes than the right handed ones from left to right. And for future reference please make sure you know what you talk about before making any comments or call something a goof.

It is the most annoying thing that I have ever heard. Boring voice! Why they chose this guy for a voice over, I have no idea. So I looked him up, (okay, he's good looking. That explains it, I guess). Anyway, I kept watching,because I really liked the other voices, and I have always loved dragons. Once you get to know the dragon, all else is forgiven. I would have given this move 10 stars if not for Hiccup's voice. Great story, great message, excellent animation, (the dragons are very creative) and a phenomenal fight scene. I don't want to give anything away, 'cause I hate when people do that, but please keep watching in spite of Hiccup's voice.", "In my opinion the movie was amazing. The voice acting, the animation, the effects, everything...except one thing. The Nordic Runes. the writing in their book isn't even close to Norse Runes, I would know because I know the Norse \"Alphabet\" if you will. but other than that small discrepancy, the movie is funny, action packed, has some romance, and the hero is the comic relief too! great eh? well enjoy the movie. *YOU CAN STOP READING HERE!

Waiting for more....!!", "In the event that my post give any spoiler info by showing the first line, I'll push any negative comments down a bit. All in all, I did like it. The characters were kind of fun. Some of the vikings did have excellent beards. Sort of predictable, but not to the point of being offensive. After all the bonding in dragon training, I got a distinct \"Mulan\"esque feeling about the little vikings. I would prefer to have an all encompassing evil non-dragon, be the ultimate enemy. I thought the characters(vikings-dragons) had gotten to the point that it was all a misunderstanding, and we could all just get along. Maybe the queen-bee mother dragon could have been less bad. And some other super evil thing would justify vikings and dragons to bond against it. And where the blazes did those other hundreds of dragons fly off to? I didn't know how many \"vikings\" had Scottish accents, either. Hmmm. Back to history class for me. OK, I'm sorry to be so picky. I did enjoy the movie, but the ending twisted the wrong way for me.", "How To Train Your Dragon shows a positive change in Dreamworks Animation. Though the studio has pumped out numerous popular animated films over the years, they've often lacked a maturity and prowess in their story-telling. While their latest offering certainly dazzles in its spectacular animation, there is a well-told story at the heart of it all, one that is often funny and sometimes quite moving. Hiccup is a viking who lives in a village that is constantly being attacked by dragons. His father, the leader of the village, is disappointed that his son is puny and lacks the will to slay dragons that is commonly found in their people. Hiccup is desperate to prove himself to his father and finally gets his chance when he manages to bring down a dragon. However, when he is unable to kill the subdued beast, Hiccup sets out on his own journey to change the way his village looks at dragons. Unfortunately the movie then succumbs to the overused plot-line of trying to bring understanding to something that is misunderstood. Hiccup learns that the dragons aren't really bloodthirsty killers and we are drawn into a series of predictable events in which he must prove to his father and his people that the dragons aren't dangerous, just misunderstood. The movie is able to overcome this shortcoming with its amusing, dramatically rich script and likable characters. Hiccup is charming in his own bumbling way and though he seems weak and cowardly, there is a lot of courage packed into his frail body. He stands up just as valiantly for the dragons as his people do in trying to slay them. During a stunning battle at the film's climax, Hiccup proves himself as a viking warrior and encourages his people to accept the dragons for what they really are. In doing so he is able to meet the expectations of both his father and his people while also winning a battle that he himself chose to fight. He doesn't come out of it all unscathed, which strengthens the point the film is trying to make. It's a positive message everyone can take something from, no matter their age, presented in a film that is breathtaking to witness.", "HTTYD was fantastic. The pacing was phenomenal, the humor was great, the character development and scripting made us really feel for the inanimate cartoons, the action was exciting and top notch. My problem with it was the ending when out of nowhere they slap in the fact that hiccup loses his leg. Sure it may signify that both hiccup and his dragon are handicapped in some way but nowhere in the (fantastic) last action sequence did it even hint that he lost his leg. It's like they just threw it in there to attempt to be deep like Pixar. Well they failed, how to train your dragon is a shallow but great movie."]}
