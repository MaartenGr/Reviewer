{"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs": [["A Movie Milestone", "Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)"], ["STILL The Fairest One Of All!", "There isn't much that hasn't already been said about \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams, it made possible the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as \"Disney's Folly\".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, \"Snow White\" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), \"Snow White\" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is.Along with a splendid cast of voices headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen), there are songs which can truly be called timeless: \"Whistle While You Work\", \"Heigh Ho\", \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\", etc.). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more \"family friendly\", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.To go on about the impact made by the film would be redundant. It simply must be seen to be appreciated. In 2001, it was released on DVD as the first of Disney's \"Platinum Editions\". And many months before it was in stores, there was great speculation about the content. All the anticipation was justified when the DVD finally arrived. Critics and consumers were overwhelmed (just like the audiences back in 1937) with both the content and the painstaking restoration (beyond that done for it's 50th anniversary reissue) and made it THE DVD for the subsequent holiday season. Without going into detail, it looks as if it were made yesterday, and sounds better than a film of this vintage could ever be expected to. But the streamlining has not diminished it's charm--only accentuated it. And when you think (before you are drawn into the story, and you ARE) that \"Snow White\", unlike today's computer-drawn animated features was entirely done by hand, that makes it even more of a miracle.In one scene, when Snow White is scrubbing the steps of the Castle, and pours water from a bucket on them, the effect is remarkable-and that one, near the beginning, is just one small sample of the film's artistry.Back to the DVD. Instead of listing the already well publicized bonus features, let me say that this \"Platinum Edition\" is like a self-contained history of the film, with hours worth of delights the most astounding being a pieced-together commentary by Walt Disney himself. Out of print for years, it is well worth the effort and expense to find. And although Disney made it a point to announce that they planned to go even further with their subsequent \"Platinum Editions\", they have yet to top this one. And I doubt they ever will. Incidentally, this year marks the film's 75th anniversary, and I can think of no better way to celebrate this movie milestone than picking up Professor Kaufman's beautiful new books The second volume '' Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs:The Art And Creation Of Walt Disney's Classic Animated film''is also published by Weldon Owen/Disney Press.It's a very extensive and fully detailed catalog of the ''Snow White'' exhibition,(currently at the Walt Disney museum in San Francisco,California).Here, the emphasis is more on the beautiful art as well as rough sketches and background paintings. Along with it's companion book ''The Fairest One Of All'' it will educate and enchant anyone who cares about the history of Film, Disney Animation and especially ''Snow White'' They are, without a doubt,the definitive tributes to a Timeless Classic, and together, they make perfect souveniers for both the film's 75th Anniversary and and a once in a lifetime event."], ["One of the best Disney films", "Beautiful and lovely in every way. The colors and the animation for this movie were beyond amazing, given that it was made in 1937 - absolutely astonishing! The story was so good even though there were a few fairy tale cliches but very inventive. It was so charming. I'll definitely be watching it again.40 out of 43 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Still one of the all-time great animated classics...", "My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at Radio City Music Hall and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler.He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a \"masterpiece\" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing \"Heigh-Ho\", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do.The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic."], ["The Queen Rules", "Quite simply, this one reigns supreme. Although much of the praise this film receives, may be due to the fact that it was it's creator's first attempt at an animated feature, I think it's obvious merits and artistic triumphs are enough to maintain it's place at the top.First, there is the artwork, which is stunning. The color isn't at it's most vibrant, such as with, say, \"Cinderella\" (1950), but it is suitable and lovely all the same. A virtual watercolor painting come to life. The details in the animation never fail to amaze. Just look at the raindrops in the chase sequence towards the end. Look how they hit the rocks, and slip away. Such attention to detail was rarely matched in an animated feature, except maybe, in \"Pinocchio\" (1940).The characters are of various degrees of interest, with Snow White, probably the least of these. The dwarfs are all charming, and it is they who carry the film during their screentime with the princess. However, one should not deny, that the true star of this film, is the evil queen. Both in her presence of glamour, and in her transformation as an old crone, she is fascinating to watch. I don't believe another Disney villian has ever been both frightening and enchanting, like she has.Lastly, the music in this film is truly memorable. The \"Heigh Ho\" sequence is visually impressive, and the dwarfs song as they bathe is a great comedy bit. Not to mention Snow White's anthem \"Someday My Prince Will Come\"; another gem in the Disney library.All in all, a tremendous production. Beautiful, thrilling, and memorable."], ["And then there was Disney,,,", "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the very first animated film featured by Disney and one of the most charming. While it's a bit different from the original fairy tale, Walt Disney took this familiar classic and turned into a family film that is still talked about over 60 years later. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is such a charming film and is another example of beautiful animation and a terrific story that could charm it's way into your heart. I still enjoy watching this film to this day, who could love the seven dwarfs? They all were so funny to watch and are so memorable. They pretty much represent our moods, they're kinda like a mood ring that's put into one room, lol. But Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the perfect family film that is still holding up very well all these years.Snow White is a lovely princess who one day is just traveling through the forest. She comes across a house where it's a total mess, she decides to clean it as a favor to those who are living there. It turns out that seven dwarfs live there and when they find her, they realize they got a good thing going here, a hot girl who'll clean for them. But not everything is happy, the evil wicked queen wants to be the fairest in the land and Snow White has just beat her by a land slide. So she disguises herself as a witch and offers Snow White an apple, she eats it, and dies. Now the queen's the hottest girl in town, but the dwarfs come up with a clever plan to get her true love, the prince, he must kill the queen and save Snow White so they could live happily ever after.I'd say that's a nice summary, I try my best anyways. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is just one of the greatest Disney films ever made. It's such a charming film and is very much apart of our pop culture today and as far as films go, this is just a great one. I can't wait to show this to my kids one day, they'll probably laugh thinking how old this movie is that it's hand drawn, but I think that's what makes it so special. The voices, the songs, the animation, everything about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was just beautiful. I highly recommend this, it's a great family film.10/10"], ["the Dwarfs steal the show, but there's much to see in this ground-breaker of cinema", "To call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a classic goes without saying that practically everyone has called it such. It is a great film, but there are certain factors that make it so, and without them the film could've gone the other way and become important more for its technical breakthrough(s) than for the content. The fact is a story with the utmost simplicity like Snow White, the chief characters- Prince Charming, the wicked Queen/witch, and of course Snow White- are all very basic, simple, if not one dimensional than basely two-dimensional characters. It's appropriate, to be sure, as it is based off a Grimm fairy tale. Despite the beauty and charm of the early scenes, its really on par entertainment-wise with the Silly Symphonies Walt Disney produced in the 30's.This also goes without saying that Snow White's run through the woods is one of the highlights of the film, still bringing a sense of terror and the surreal for the adults in the audience (if you're a little kid it could be one of the scariest things you've ever seen). But then- just as Snow White settles into her little 'hide-out' in a house she thinks occupied by messy, orphaned children- we're introduced to the seven dwarfs, and this is where the film picks up most of its energy, laughs, and complete and total balance. In a way, not to analyze too deep for a filmed fairy tale, they each represent the different sides of men, and so it gives the film the appropriate human dimensions it needs (in this, also setting up practically all the hand-drawn Disney films of the next seventy years or so). It's tempting to say which are my favorite, or whom I got the most enjoyment out of. There would be three, two for more obvious reasons, one for subtle ones.Dopey, who is almost a perfect re-incarnation (in Disney Dwarf form of course) of Harpo Marx- he's a lovable idiot, with barely two sounds in the course of the film, who (and I hate to sound sappy) brings out the laughing kid in anyone. Grumpy, who I found to be maybe the most complete character in the film, has attitude to spare, and gets comic bit after comic bit happen to him from the animators- and yet, there is heart behind him, and when its revealed in key parts of the film, they act as the most emotional points. There is also Sleepy, who also barely says a word, but who's physical movements are really divine little moments among the big, inspired musical numbers. Indeed, there are little moments throughout the film that help make up the greatness: the mood and atmosphere in the Queen's dungeon of witchcraft; the scene where the dwarfs go to sleep (a fly that rests on Sleepy's nose); the traits given to the animals in the forest (that little turtle is hilarious).All these parts help to add to the basic structure of the story- Queen wants the good looks, goes after her once the hunter fails, gives her the poison apple, then it goes even more predictable from their (though in a good way). The detail of the animated scenes, the backgrounds, the visual effects, are often mesmerizing. And the songs, which were some of the most standard I heard from the Disney oeuvre as a kid (they were always on those Disney 'Sing-along' videos) are still whimsical most of the time. Then there is also the icing on the cake- the voice of Snow White, Adriana Caselotti (who got contracted into this being her only film role, based of producer/uncredited director Disney's insistence), brings something to the film that's hard to describe, except to say that it's, well, serene.Even if she's not the strongest character, her main goal of making people around her feel good and inspiring happiness makes her watchable, and in a way lovable. It's a very curious, though important, factor that she (and Prince Charming and the Queen pre-witch) are animated very traditionally, apart from the cartoon-like dwarfs and animals. Its a reminder of the film's, and Disney's, strongest success- that as an imagined and visualized fairy tale, the representation is strong, and touching. In the new century studios move away from hand-drawn animated films, but it's a good idea to look back to the early Disney films, if not for just nostalgia (or to watch with your kids) to get a sense of the experimentation, the purity of it. It remains one of only several animated films, from any country or style, to have the crucial elements come together- music, voice-talent, usage of colors, and cinematography."], ["Almost 70 Years Later, This Still Holds Up Well", "This was Walt Disney's first animated full-length movie. I've read where it took somewhere between two to five years to make, and the artwork still stands up to today's standards. It still looks good, especially with today's DVD technology and great-looking television sets. This film, along with Bambi, exhibit some fantastic watercolor-type artwork with the latter being ever more spectacular than this one.The story is \"cute\" because of the seven dwarfs. The evil character - the queen - doesn't have that big a role so most of the time it's just a sweet, enjoyable film with nice characters. It's one of the those movies that makes you feel good as you are watching it.To be honest, some of the scenes lag a bit and Snow White's operatic voice is a bit much for me, but those are the only complaints I could find in this classic film, one of the best ever from Disney.57 out of 66 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["The first of many Disney classics", "Disney's \"Snow White\" was the very first full length animated film and without it, we most likely would have never had the classics that came years after.Snow White lives in a castle with her stepmother who is jealous of her stepdaughter's beauty and wishes to kill her so she will become \"the fairest of them all.\" Snow White runs away into the forest and comes across the cottage of the seven Dwarfs and they agree to let her stay but the Queen decides to take care of Snow White herself upon discovering that she is still alive and living with the seven dwarfs.For starters, the animation is fantastic and you can only imagine how long it must have taken the animators to draw out one frame alone. The studio was also used to animating characters in a silly style like Mickey Mouse at the time and the training they went through shows how determined Walt Disney was to make this film happen especially considering he put a mortgage on his house to get the money to make the film and would have ended up homeless if it failed.The voice cast is also fantastic, especially upon learning that this was Adrianna Caselotti's first role in a motion picture. Most modern Disney fans criticise her voice for Snow White and label it \"annoying\" but I feel the voice fits the character perfectly since Snow White is 14 years old in the film. Lucille La Verne is also great as the Queen and captures the wicked nature of her cruel intentions perfectly.Many also complain about the changes from the source material despite the fact that not everything from a book can be adapted into a film. I feel that making Snow White 14 in the film instead of 7 like in the original tale was a better choice as seeing a child go through certain events in the film such as the forest scene may have been traumatising.Overall, this is one of the studios best animated features with impressive animation, a great cast of voices and is the reason why we have the classics we know and love today."], ["The first and still the best.", "My favorite all-time animated movie.

This movie is now so highly rated and acclaimed that in 2007, the American Film Institute named this animated flick the 34th best American film of ALL TIME.Even while watching it as a little kid, watching it again as a grown up teenager still brings back awesome memories, proving that the story, the characters and beautiful music is gripping and makes this a fascinating tale. Snow White herself is drawn so beautifully that you can't help but simply admire her, and the incredibly adorable voicing from Adriana Caselotti is a child's fascination. The Seven Dwarfs are very united and usually do things together- they live together, work together etc. But they are all different in personality and even in appearance. One example is Grumpy, who is for a while reluctant to accept Snow White and cold towards her, but is still one to play a part to rescue her from the Queen when danger arrives. They are the other backbone of the story, and are my personal favourite in this.This one animated film has received a lot of praise and attention over the years, right up until now 3 quarters of a century later, because by 1937 standards this is just phenomenal. Kudos Walt Disney for having the far-sightedness and innovation to create this stupendous movie in Technicolor back then and making it fun and realistic.

I've just watched Snow White for the umpteenth time, and decided it's still as wondrous and lustrous as ever. The music, humour, and animation are stuck magically in the 1930's but it all seems as timeless as the story itself. The best place to see it is in a cinema of course, the same as my daughter and I did over and over again before Disney released it on video in '94.All available positive epithets (magnificent, amazing, stupendous etc) apply to this one, nearly a 10 in my book. For good or bad SW will never be surpassed, because of capitalist pressures to ensure everything makes money: animation designed and drawn by human beings has lost out to the precise but soulless computer. Ditto music with tunes and marvellous lyrics played well. Gentle humour that the entire family can appreciate has given way to appreciation of smut and cynicism. And that's just Disney! My favourite bits: The song \"Wishing\", and looking up the well at SW; the dwarfs first seeing her SW in their beds asleep; the dwarfs' washing sequence and song. The only thing I never liked was the apparently rushed ending - the dwarfs are looking after SW's \"inanimate\" body through the seasons, this handsome guy comes along, kisses her and they both skedaddle into the massive sunset at warp speed! I think I wanted it to last another couple of hours.Overall, to my feeble mind this is High Art!

I have to tell you, those things they say about Disney and little kids are true. I have never seen anything since that affected me as profoundly. There was the sense of evil. The Queen with the mirror. The fact that she is sending a child into the woods to be killed. My gosh. I'm five years old and a child is about to be murdered. Then there are those little guys, each with a character trait to match his name. The story is one of vengeance. The queen transforming herself and then going on the prowl with those apples. The scene of her death is horrible.And then there is a death experience. She lies in that crystal coffin. Will she be OK? Everyone was crying in the theater. And then, of course, the prince comes along. It's just a masterful telling of a simple tale with memorable characters, violence, and purification through suffering.

The film was a tremendous hit when it was first released and it really broke new ground in regards to what people would be willing to sit through. After all, it was a mystery if people in 1937 would be willing to sit through a feature-length cartoon and whether or not they'd be able to show emotions towards animated characters.As for the film itself, it's certainly a great one from Disney's original Golden Age. There's no question that the most impressive thing is how great the actual animation is. I've seen plenty of cartoons from this era and the quality is usually good but there's no question that the amount of detail was just taken to a new level here. Just take a look at how much detail is in the forest scenes. Look at the detail to the seven dwarfs.

Man alive, I really enjoyed it! What a good film! Seriously, by any standard, it's stood the test of time beautifully and it's a wonderful piece of cinema.The story we should all know. You have Princess Snow White - perhaps the most stunning cartoon woman ever? Not only is she beautiful, but she's extremely lovely and pleasant. If she existed, she'd be the next Princess Diana or Mother Teresa. It seems that everyone who meets her grows soon enough to adore her. But not everyone loves our dear Princess. Her wicked step-mother hates her and is terribly jealous of her. That's because Snow White is thought to be the 'fairest in the land'. So the Queen plans to have her killed by a Huntsman.

She's the ideal woman! But the Queen discovers her plan has failed and decides to take matters into her own hands...It's a very simple but thoroughly captivating story. The characters are superb and wildly likable. They are marvellously given life by the great work of the cartoonists and the actors who voiced them. This is an excellent collection of some very fine voice actors, especially Adriana Caselotti as Snow White. She sings like an angel and her innocent voice is very lovely indeed. The music is well suited to the story and memorable, particularly the infamous 'Hi Ho' song.The fun bits are fun; the serious bits are serious; the awful bits are awful; the feel-good bits make you feed good.

Snow White, cut loose from the castle, stumbles upon a hut where seven dwarves are living - which is where the Queen comes for her, in disguise, with a poison apple...This has classic written all over it. Disney's first major feature, the grand debut, cements the major features of those to come. It draws from very dark but fantastic material, Grimm's Fairy Tales, and alternates scenes of evocative darkness (the Queen's castle, the man sent to cut Snow White's heart out, and the forest that's alive, are some brilliant examples) with scenes of superlative cuteness and song and dance numbers.Drawbacks:There are some beautiful compositions, but the movement of the animation is not as fluid as it would become, even with Pinnochio, Disney's very next feature. Plus, the singing styles are very 1930's opera-style. I can see why i always used to just think of songs during musicals as things i had to wait through till the story got going again - its because almost every song in Snow White doesn't advance the story. Great musical numbers, like the ones in West Side Story, do. They don't feel like we're just waiting around. When most of the Snow White songs come on, the story gets put on hold.Snow White is too naive, plain and perfect a character to hold our interest these days. Contemporary audiences just don't worship \"perfect\" people like this. Plus, the attempts at animation of real people is not good. Snow White and the Prince in particular just don't work - whereas the cartoony dwarves really come alive. Try watching her face when she talks.Highlights:All of the Queen's scenes are absolute gems, actually. And the dwarves are great. Seven great characters.One of the best things Disney ever did was the Queen's angry walk down the staircase to the dungeon, and her subsequent making of a potion to transform herself into an old witch. The way the liquid she's mixing comes alive is fantastic, and the close-ups on the crow sitting on the skull are a nice touch.The poison flooding towards the centre of the pot, engulfing the apple, and the jack o'lantern face on it afterwards.Some of Disney's most classic songs come from Snow White: Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho (its off to work we go), and one of the most beautiful Disney songs ever, Some Day My Prince Will Come.There's also a very memorable piece of theme music that plays during the climactic storm scene.10/10.

The Queen angrily learns about her failed death, and decides to poison the young princess!Since this is the Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it is packed with extra features including a tour of the animation studios in the 1930s, actual interviews with Walt Disney, cool facts, (Did you know Snow White was originally designed to have gold hair? Who knew!) and so much more. My favorite part concentrates on how Walt Disney hired over 300 artists, how he spent so much money on making it perfect, and just how much speculation and hate he got for attempting to make (and being very successful as a result) a 90 minute animated film.Even though this film was made almost a century ago, the quality of the animation is as good as films made today. Hand-drawn animation has a quality of from the human touch that CGI can never achieve. In terms of the soundtrack, Walt Disney had a knack for making his animated films not only have background music, but he created it in such as way that the music becomes an integral part of the story. For example, when Snow White and the Prince first meet, they sing a song together and it represents almost, \"Instant love,\" better than words ever could. This story is based on a classic European fairy tale, and Walt Disney hired a few people who specifically made European-styled drawings, to make the film feel like the original fairy tale, which was perfect for the film. The voice-over sound quality is also top notch, amazingly so since again, it was made almost 100 years ago. I would easily compare it to the voice over acting and quality of the late 90s. This film was ambitious in terms of being the first animated feature film, but also was first feature film to have a female lead.My favorite scene is the meeting of The Prince and Snow White. In the scene, Snow White is cleaning outside and she explains to her bird friends what a wishing well is. A prince overhears her fantastic singing and is love-struck when he meets her. This scene is one of my favorites because the music is beautiful, the animation is spectacular and this scene specifically illustrates my point about European artists designing the backgrounds. It really looks like a European castle of some sort.This film was designed for all ages and I still agree. I recommend it for ages 6 to 13 specifically. Younger kids will enjoy the bright colors, dancing and singing. Older kids can appreciate how difficult it was to make this film and the storyline itself. Adults who have happy memories of seeing this film years ago will also enjoy it. Overall, it's a great film for the family. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars because of the spectacular animation, exciting story (typical of films made by Walt Disney) and clear voice acting."], ["Groundbreaking classic and it's actually fun", "The first full-length animated feature from the Disney Studios is a hit and has led the way for every animated movie since. Snow White is a beautiful princess who is targeted by the jealous Queen. The Queen orders the Huntsman to kill Snow White, but he takes pity on her and sends her off into the woods. There she is rescued by the Seven Dwarfs. The Queen finds out that Snow White has survived and decides to curse her with her own poison apple.It is deserving of the label classic. The story is fun. I love the Dwarfs. I love the Queen. I wish Snow White could be less girly girl, but those were the times. For being a first, it does it with great charm. It is a credit to the movie world. There are great catchy songs. Even a dated song like 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' is still very compelling.6 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Still fair", "For all its historical importance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is not treated well by most Disney fans. It is tolerated, but not respected or loved. Common complaints fall upon the heroine being too passive, the music being too dated, too much padding, etc. No film is perfect, even great films, but my God, people are too harsh on this one.No other Disney film possesses the innocence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It has a freshness, an excitement to it. It's as though you could feel the animators' joy in every frame. There is no hip irony or cynicism on display, no need to be subversive or cool. The whole thing is a fairy tale played straight and with tons of heart. It isn't hard to see why weary Depression audiences so readily took it to their hearts and declared it \"the happiest thing since Armistice\".Snow White is not complex or super interesting as a character, but she has more of a personality than she is given credit for. She is also tougher than you'd think: she's a young teenage girl from an abusive home, yet she still believes she should keep a positive view of life and tries her best to stay optimistic through all her troubles. That's admirable. As for her warbling soprano, many will not favor it and yes, it is dated. However, don't be too harsh there. After all, I doubt the modern pop hit \"Let It Go\" in Frozen (2013) will gracefully age either.Of course, the dwarfs are all lovable and entertaining. The Queen/Witch is chilling, one of the finest Disney villains. The Prince... well, he's rather dull. Honestly, I don't get the criticism of Snow's supposed lack of personality; she has it all over her prince.The animation is still beautiful, even if there are a few awkward moments due to rotorscoping and experimentation. The muted color scheme is lovely, a great contrast to the exhausting bright colors which saturate modern animation (I mainly think of the garish Hercules (1997) or The Lorax (2012)). The backgrounds give one the impression of a children's storybook come to life.Overall, this is a great film and we are still feeling its influence (for better or worse, since American animation is rarely allowed to leave the Snow White model). Without a doubt, it deserves more respect from modern audiences."], ["The one that started it all is still the fairest one of all", "In early 1934, when production started,everyone thought Walt Disney was mad to make the first ever animated feature film. All that changed on December 21,1937, as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs was embraced by not only critics, but everyone.And how it is still loved today. Nobody gets old enough for Snow White, and I doubt anybody will.It is simply the original fairytale, only animated. It has a few changes from the original tale, but really, I'd say the changes are for the better. The characters are amazing, each has their own unique look and personality to them,and the voice acting is outstanding.The whole look of the movie is beautiful, every moment is enchanting. Out of every single film out there, and I'm just not talking about animated films, if there is one film that I think has the most beautiful moments, it's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.The songs are simply a pleasure to hear. From 'I'm Wishing' to 'Someday My Prince Will Come', you'll fall in love.Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is the best animated film of all time. It may not be my favourite(That being The Lion King), but no doubt it is the BEST of all time. In fact, I think it's one of the best films of all time. It's simply incredible, with humour, drama, romance and even some intense scenes. I rented out the new Diamond edition a few weeks ago, and can I just say, it looks as if it were made yesterday, no lie.For anyone, I would most certainly recommend Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. It's the one that started it all, and it will always be the fairest one of all."], ["And they lived happily ever after", "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who\"s the fairest one of all? The Queen asks everyday to to her trusted enchanted mirror who always replies that she is until one day another name is given.What I enjoy about Walt Disney's classic fairy tale is true beauty comes from within. The Queen is stunningly beautiful, but on the inside an ugly witch who wants nothing more then to destroy her step daughter who was pretty within, caring and sensitive. Snow White cares for the men who took her in, cleans their house, cooks dinner and pumps them up everyday before they go off to work in the diamond mines while her mother takes life for granted.The visuals are stunning, the music enchanting and the characters enduring making it a true testament to filmaking with limited technology available at the time.A problem I had with the story itself is the prince who was the only one not fleshed out or given personality and only there to serve as a love interest. He's bland, boring and perfect without any flaws making the romance feel a little rushed. The first half was exciting as Snow runs for her life, meeting her prince and the huntsmen's death, but it mellows out once she reaches the closet stuck with chores to do.I was captivated by the evilness the Queen displayed with her suave body language, her shivering crackle and frightening transformation into an old hag straight out of tales from the crypt.While there have been complaints from special interest groups on the artist merit of the picture and its portrayal of women I found her to be the most courageous, brave and daring of them all."], ["An Absolute Masterpiece That Changed the Cinema Forever", "In thirties there was some short animations, and so Walt Disney decided to make a full-length movie, and many people thought he was going crazy, that nobody will stand this, and so on. After more than four years of hard work for him and his team, and more than a million dollars spent, the movie was ready in December 1937, and the result was amazing. With an impressive and creative work from the designers, the characters come alive in a captivating way, and the public was mesmerized with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The audience was thrilled, many come to tears after Snow White ate the the poisoned apple, and the success was so astonishing that the movie became one of the most watched movies in history, and it still continues to captivate millions of people around the world. This was Walt Disney's cornerstone, all that he made after was based on this unique movie, and because of it he was one of the few persons in the world able to fulfill the most of his dreams.

This movie is right up there with Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. I still love this movie after all these years.The seven dwarfs are cute, comical and each of them as cuddly as a teddy bear - including Grumpy! Without the comic relief of the dwarven the movie would be a good drama.Snow White has all the inner and outer beauty that a person could hope for. She's cheerful, helpful, charming, polite, friendly and fun. Quite a nice character.Queen Grimhilde is the picture of all vanity. She wants to be the only beautiful woman in the kingdom. She is quite beautiful on the outside but she lacks the inner beauty that Snow White has which makes her more angry and jealous at Snow.Prince Florian is a dashing and daring guy who has his eyes on the beautiful Snow White. Prince Florian is another \"Prince Charming\" and our hero of the film.Yes this is a great Walt Disney classic that should be seen if only once in you lifetime.10/10"], ["Still the fairest of them all.", "The first of a growing cannon of classics, 'Snow White' epitomises the Walt Disney Company ethos of dreams coming true. The world's first feature length animated film succeeds not only as a masterpiece of filmmaking, but also in being the earliest representation of jokes and tropes that are nowadays a common clich\u00e9.With an opening credit dedicated to the perseverance of his team of animators and various other personnel, the enormity of the task that was Walt Disney's original ambitious endeavour is clear in its first few frames. Everything audiences take for granted in the new millennium of computer wizardry and computer generated effects marks a milestone in his earliest classic, from its sheer length to its lasting beauty.The movie's charm never relents, but is also genuine and never overbearing. The story is simple, yet efficient and effective. 'Snow White' is a condensed vessel for the studio's genius, every shot brimming with creativity, a timeless labour of love that proved how all that would follow might be possible.Walt Disney's vision is never compromised, from references to gore through terrifying sequences of hauntings and witchcraft. It's this determination to make people laugh, to make them scared, to take them on a journey that makes 'Snow White' a wonderfully immersive celebration of storytelling.10/10"], ["A milestone in cinema...still the greatest animated film of all time", "Having just picked up quite possibly the last copy of the recent Diamond Edition of this film, and watching for the first time in 15 years, I am compelled to write this review. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is 74 years old this year, and it doesn't feel like it has aged a bit. What everyone thought would be a flop is the reason we have the likes of Pinocchio (1940), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Toy Story (1995) and Tangled (2011). This film blew away audiences back then, being hailed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements and even being proclaimed the greatest film of all time by Russian director Sergei M. Eisenstein. The amazing thing is, Snow White blew people away when it was re-released in 2001 in the Platinum Edition, reminding people that the older Disney movies are timeless, and will never be topped.Adapted from the Grimm Fairytale and made family-friendly, Snow White follows the story of...Snow White (Adriana Caselotti), who is proclaimed the \"fairest of them all,\" much to the distaste of her stepmother, The Queen (Lucille La Verne). A hunter is hired to take Snow White out into the woods and kill her, returning her heart to The Queen as proof, but having a change of heart, lets Snow White escape. She stumbles across an old house in the woods, which houses seven dwarfs.The re-master is gorgeous, highlighting just how beautiful the animation is, and why hand-drawn will always be the best. The animals are cute as ever, the \"evil woods\" scene looks stunning, The Queen's transformation still frightening, and the final scene in the storm is just as epic as it was when I was five! I forgot just how many fantastic musical numbers this movie had, with \"Whistle While you Work,\" \"Heigh Ho\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" sounding as good as ever.This film spawned some of the greatest family films of all time, with Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo and Fantasia following straight after Snow White's success. As a 20 year old guy, I thought the magic may have worn off, but this film is a lasting legacy, a testament to the brilliance of these old Disney films. Watching this again, I found myself smiling at the antics of the dwarfs, singing to songs I'd long forgotten, and crying with the dwarfs over Snow White's body. Snow White has managed to enchant audiences for 74 years, and will continue doing so for as long as I can imagine.5/5"], ["The jewel of animation", "So Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first ever animated feature length film, and people had told Disney 'It would never work'. Well, it appears that they were wrong in the end, as this is one of the most beautiful and amazing films, and that I am being honest! The character's are interesting and you never get bored of them, despite the Prince not having a major role. But that didn't bother me really, as all the scenes and songs are just amazing to watch and hear! This really is the jewel of animation. Animation has changed over the years, and a lot of people pay more attention to computer-animated films now. But I'll be surprised if somebody watches this movie and dosen't see how amazing 2-d animation can be. It is the inspiration for all animated movies, and it'll always be treasured. Simply Disney at it's best.

It was an artistic achievement in 1937, and it still stands up as a landmark in movie history. The story is (as most people will know), a princess is orphaned and is 'looked after' by her stepmother, who grows increasingly jealous of the young princess's growing beauty. The princess, Snow White, is forced to slave away for her stepmother, the Queen, until the Queen decides to have her killed. However, the huntsman chosen to do the deed cannot go through with it, and Snow White is forced to run away into the forest where she is taken in by seven dwarfs. All is fine, until the Queen realises that Snow White is not dead. Cue the transformation scene and the poison apple...and that's as far as I'll go.Although the heroine is, admittedly, two-dimensional and the movie comes across as bordering sexist...well, it's a product of it's time. I'll leave it at that.The fact that the beautiful animation can still stand up next to more recent Disney movies is an achievement in itself. And the fact that you can compare the two and probably say that Snow White's animation is superior is an even greater achievement.The songs are beautiful, Snow White's singing *is* proper singing, she has more talent then many of the recent Broadway princesses put together. Product of the time maybe, but still outstanding. 9/10"], ["HEIGH HO, HEIGH HO, It's Wonderful You Know", "The Walt Disney Studios went a long way towards earning its nickname of The Magic Kingdom with the release of Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. There will never be another version of the beloved Grimm Brothers fairy tale because you couldn't find all the elements that make this one work so well.I imagine that with today's computer generated graphics you could come up with a more realistic animation. But it would probably frighten the children and in all the wrong places. More than the wicked queen would be frightening folks.Snow White is a tale of imagination, something that lets the kids work their minds and really get into the characters. The voices selected so perfectly match the animated figures. And with the exception of Billy Gilbert they're not known players. Snow White is first and foremost a character driven story. Today the Disney Studio would probably take from their stable of TV and film personalities for voices, but the emphasis would be on the celebrities not the story. I don't think Disney Studios alone would be guilty of that however.Much as I like the simple story, the thing I love best about the film is the musical score that Frank Churchill and Larry Morey wrote. This is the Annie Get Your Gun of animated films, so many different and beloved hits come out of it. Even today you can hear people offhandedly humming 'Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho' and they might not realize where it's from, it's so ingrained in our consciousness, almost like Happy Birthday.A favorite song of mine is the operatic ballad One Song that the prince and Snow White both sing. I have a recording of it that Allan Jones did and it's a gem. It could have come out of a score by Sigmund Romberg or Rudolf Friml, it's that good.The movie DVD is still a hot seller, it's like White Christmas and the other Christmas songs that Bing Crosby did which still keep his name before the public every Yuletide season and keeps making money for his estate. Why is Snow White so popular? Very simply it's one of the best cartoon features every made."], ["My Favorite Disney Classic Film", "There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure.Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine.As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha.The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith.Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the \"Whistle While You Work\", \"Heigh-Ho\", \"I'm wishing\" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one.The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic."], ["A marvelous movie !", "A real masterpiece ? This film has the usual stunning Disney animation A simple jet effective story and good characters. It is as impossible to dislike this movie as it is to dislike Snow White herself. The songs are memorable,the dwarfs unforgettable and the Queen menacing.

Watching thisrecently, I was struck by how simple and straightforward a watch it is. It really is the most simple fairytale you can get, and it seemed so much bigger when I was little. But nonetheless it still tells a great story of good and evil, wonder, and of course the happy ending, that's such a joy to get into. It looks like a storybook come to life and has such a charming quaintness to it that gets right in your heart and stays there! I can't help but marvel at all the endless rich small details there are in everything, there's such magnificent artistry on display here. The lush outdoor scenes, and the incredible realistic use of light and shadows. The animators took everything they learned from the wonderful training ground that was the Silly Symphonies and poured all of the best elements and techniques into this, and you can feel the spirit of what they were trying to express in animated form and it's beautiful and quite amazing. It's simplistic but it was their very first film. The next one though has a great complexity of emotions and dark undertones to it. Not by any means that this doesn't have its grim touches. Words such as dead kill death and blood are spoken, the excellent early scene where Snow White gets overwhelmed by her own fear and sees the woods as monstrous faces feels like a bit of a homage to the early more twisted animations of the Fleisher Brothers to me. There's the macabre prospect of an actual heart the Queen holds in an ornate box that's left to the imagination, and the climactic scene where the Dwarfs charge after the Queen - my goodness, they clearly mean to kill her! And finally when through her own doing she falls to her death very ominously. Snow White herself is so impossibly lovely and adorable that it's like she represents happiness and innocence. She's just a sweet singing girl in the woods with apparently a superpower to command the animals! You ask me if a person can watch \"Whistle While You Work\" without smiling or feeling lightened at all then they ain't got no heart... She has the voice of an angel and children have loved her for generations. Not to criticise too harshly, but I noticed that apart from supplying many cute and funny sight gags, the animals also serve the purpose of making Snow White seem larger as a character. And when it's not them it's the Dwarfs. And in my opinion it's actually the Prince who's the real cardboard cutout character, but that's not his fault! And ah, the Queen, if nothing else you couldn't say that she's not a proactive woman! I love her, she's so ice cold and commanding. Her malicious intentions to Snow White alone make her one of the scariest Disney villains ever, for she plain old wants her dead, simply for being too pretty! My favourite scene is the exquisitely animated sequence that skillfully builds the malevolence where the evil Queen concocts a potion comprised of the most menacing of ingredients to transform into a cackling old crone. Her disorienting transformation from second fairest in the land to hideous hag is like a formula created by Alfred Hitchcock. And as she turns around and reveals her new face, every child in the theatre was compelled to jump in horror. Very witch-like, right down to the wart on the nose. From an adult's perspective however, the before and after makeover is truly a trick and a treat. It makes me laugh every time when the crow is in the skull! The Dwarfs are what most people always remembered. It's in the collective consciousness because of them. In Gremlins, everybody knows what \"Hi-Ho!\" is! My favourite one is Grumpy because he pretends not to care, but he cares very much. It means something to me when he secretly blushes at Snow White's kiss, when he warns her not to let anyone in the cottage, when he cries out \"We gotta save her!\", and at that sad scene that's like a wake he sobs more than any of them at her supposed death. Good character, gruff and mean on the outside, kind on the inside. At the time before it came out they said that a feature length 'cartoon' couldn't work, that no one could emotionally connect to a character that was hand-drawn. How wrong they were. This film's true impact on popular culture is untold, I mean for one thing there wouldn't have been a Wizard of Oz movie without it, and that picture is a whole phenomenon in itself, nor would there have been a Disney legacy as we know it without the success of this film. It's certainly archaic, but to me it doesn't particularly feel like something that's pushing one hundred years, which is something that truly makes it, as Disney would say, timeless. The \"greatest folly\", ended up being the greatest triumph. I always love watching this, I feel the same way about it that I do about all the Disney films that I love, watching them is like 'going home...'"], ["The Fairest of them All", "No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it \"Disney's Folly\". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"The Lion King\", \"Toy Story\", and \"Finding Nemo\" all owe to this movie: \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\".Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, \"Snow White\" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. \"Snow White\" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss.The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with \"Heigh-ho\" and \"Someday my Prince will Come\" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development.So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot.

For this film, the animators under Walt Disney's supervision had to create an entirely new process, they had to create not just well-rounded characters but they had to reinvent an entirely new film method of language in order to design a film literally from scratch.It wasn't enough to simply put together a cohesive story. The world inside Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is populated in every inch of the screen with supporting characters: rabbits, birds, turtles, deer, skunks, chipmunks, squirrels, mice, etc. They packed the frame so that everything is always in motion and we are never faced with any negative space. Where most films are interested in the two or four characters in the center, the animator's genius was to create a population, a full-rounded world that suggested that space existed just off camera. That, in our minds, creates an orientation of three-dimensional space onto a film that doesn't have any. Live action films always have space off-camera, but in animation, it doesn't exist.The technological marvel was the multi-plane camera which allowed objects in the foreground and the background to move independently of one another and independently of the central action. It also allowed the objects in the frame to move at various speeds and various distances to create a three-dimensional feel. This was long before computers, when animation was a painstaking practice in which each cell was drawn and painted one-by-one by hand (production on this film actually began in 1934). On the multi-plane camera, pieces of the artwork were lain on various platters on the camera that moved independently of one another so the various cells could move opposite of one another. The result was that a house in the background could have objects moving independently in the foreground.The animators had the talent to create a palette that was alive. Take, for example, Snow White's nightmare journey through the forest as the branches of the trees reach out and the eyes bear down upon her. It would be enough just to have a girl frightened by the forest but to see it through her eyes to visualize the nightmare is part of the extra step, the further burst of inspiration. It wasn't entirely necessary to give the trees eyes or to draw them in such detail that they have twisted, angry faces, but it adds a level of generosity to the visuals.But the palette would be nothing without expressive characters to put in front of it. The seven dwarfs have faces that are expressive, with big eyes, wide mouths and soft-round bodies, much like a child. And with the details in character design, they were also infused with emotions. Take for example the scene in which the dwarfs mourn for Snow White, their teary faces hung down in true expression. It would be one thing if the dwarfs simply cried, but note how the light and shadow play across their sad faces. No two characters are alike, no two characters move alike. There's real sadness in that scene. The whole movie is like that. The Dwarfs are seen as individuals, and we can easily tell them apart by more than their names and corresponding tics. The same can be said for the wicked queen, whose face glows with stunning beauty and whose disguise, an old crone, is round and somewhat inviting (we can understand the trap that Snow White falls into).Ironically, the least impressive characters are Snow White and Prince Charming. They look and act and movie with such realism that they aren't quite as interesting. How would Snow White have lasted in history if the Disney animators had given her more animated dimension, more to the tone of the dwarfs? And despite the title, the dwarfs and the evil Queen actually dominate the picture. They are so exaggerated that they have more room to play. The Queen too has exaggerated movements but only after she is transformed into the old crone.What Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs offers is the full experience of what the canvas of an animated feature can do. It explores a storytelling medium that would be severely limited in a live-action movie and frees it up to expand imagination. Others have come along and others have done better, but Snow White came first and it's was a major step from what had come before. What genius. What generosity of the visuals. What imagination."], ["\"Prepare to be amazed beyond all expectations.\"", "My favorite Disney film. Obviously its historical importance can't be stressed enough but let's not overlook how wonderfully entertaining it is. If you like sweet, colorful fairy tale stories, it doesn't get much better than this. There are lots of memorable scenes and songs. The characters are lively and fun, even the evil Queen. It should also be pointed out that, for all of the adorable animals and dwarfs, there are some genuinely spooky parts, too. Snow White fleeing through the shadowy forest is possibly my favorite scene of the whole movie. The Queen's ultimate fate is also quite dark. It's really a terrific film. A timeless classic that is essential viewing for everybody. I grew up a half-century after this came out and its age didn't show to me at all.

Many people dismiss those films, mostly because they consider them to be \"only for kids\".In fact, it is not only Disney films: Many good animation films are ignored and labeled as kid's stuff, disregard of the quality of the histories or the visual beauty of them. Even in the recent year, with the success of cartoons such as \"The Simpsons\", \"South Park\", King of the Hill\" and even \"Family Guy\" (Though I hate that show), animation is still considered a \"minor\" genre, with the children always being considered as the main target of it. Personally, I don't care about those prejudices: I have seen many animated films and series during my whole life. Some of them were good, others were bad\u0085Some were excellent, and also, there were some animated films that had more artistic value and were more mature than many live-action films, even those that are considered \"classics\".And even when \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" it's a movie \"for kids\" (I prefer to say that it's a movie for the whole family) that doesn't avoid it to have many artistic qualities that could be appreciated by the adults: In fact, I have to say this is one of the most beautiful films ever made. Not only the quality of the animation it's incredibly good even by modern standards (Actually, the animation from this film seems much more fluid and \"alive\" than many of the recent movies made with CGI, with splendid sceneries, and a lovely use of colors) but also the story of this film, (despite that it could be considered way too simple by modern viewers) has a unique feeling of magic that not many movies have, being comparable with classic movies such as \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Thief of Bagdad\"\u0085That \"magic\" is present in every single scene from this movie, where everything seems to be made with love and effort, an honest work made for the enjoyment of the audience, a quality that most of the modern movies have forgotten in order to became heartless product for the mass consumption.They don't make animated movies like this anymore, which is such a shame. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" totally deserves to be considered as a classic. This might sound strange, but personally I think that, even today, this movie is incredibly underrated, and deserves way more love than it receives."], ["Perhaps the Most Beloved and Treasured Piece of Cinema of All Time", "Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is arguably the single most endearing film of all time.

With excellent humor, charming and very lovable characters (for the most part), and songs that still hold up today, Disney had succeeded in transforming animation into anything but a genre, which, sadly, is what most audiences think of these types of movies today. Appreciate not just the importance to animation, but also the character development and the story. This was a movie that I could see frequently, for my grandparents have it on VHS, and it has been a family favorite like Aladdin, The Jungle Book, and The Fox and The Hound. We were proud of Disney back then, and we are still proud of Disney for recognizing that animation is not meant to be catered to children via dumb humor and unnecessarily over-the-top movement (looking at you, Sony).

There isn't much that hasn't already been said about \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" 1937 version, Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams. The movie that made possibility of the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were supposedly referring to it as \"Disney's Folly\".Although this myth has been recently debunked in film historian JB. Kaufman's magnificent new book (''The Fairest One Of All:The Making Of Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''Weldon Owen/Disney Press, 2012)it's true that only after it's huge success, did fellow movie makers attempt their own full-length cartoon features. Upon it's debut, at Hollywood's Carthay Circle theater, (December 21, 1937)the film was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds.

Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more \"family friendly\", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938."], ["Snow White Review", "So, I've decided to watch and review all Disney animated classics, their sequels and TV shows. Naturally, I started with \"Snow White,\" which (prepares body armour) I'd never seen.The story is based on the Brother's Grimm tale,and was the first ever fully animated motion picture, released in 1937. It was Adolf Hitler's favourite movie. The more you know.Within, we have Snow White, a pale skinned, raven haired beauty who trusts everyone like a derpy puppydog, but is so nice you can't help but enjoy her. She is the prettiest in the land, much to the unease of her stepmother, the Evil Queen. Queenie orders her loyal huntsman to off Snow, but she is just so smexy and innocent that he balks, and lets her go. Snow runs through the forest in terror, only to come across some friendly animals, who guide her to a humble cottage owned by seven dwarfs. The dwarfs agree she can stay, and in return Snow offers to keep house. Everything is fine and dandy, until Queenie discovers that Snow is NOT dead, that the heart she requested is a pig's, so she magics herself into an ugly hag, creates a poison apple and sets off to do Snow in herself.The story is simple, and Snow isn't the most amazing heroine, but she is nice. REALLY nice. She happy and chipper, yet quite assertive in the do-as-your-mother-says way. Her curiosity and innocence is both endearing and grating; her excitement over a tiny chair is just too sweet, yet her swooning over this hunky prince dude is just blegh, but maybe I'm just a cynic. Snow meshes well with her dwarf pals, and has a likable, soothing aura, which is saying something for an animated character. The dwarfs are good fun, and are easily the highlight of the movie. Each have their own distinct personality and each gets to shine through, hell they even look very different, kudos to that! They couldn't do that in the Hobbit where there was like, twenty of them? My favourite was Grumpy; I just love the old curmudgeon with the heart of gold. When he's the first one to jump on a deer to save Snow I was cheering on the inside, haha.Where the film truly stands out is the animation and backgrounds. The colours, even though not as bright as the later Disney films, are still vibrant. The backgrounds are stunning, and I hope Disney do something like \"Bolt\" and bring painterly backgrounds in again. The animation is so smooth, and the musical and comedic timing is spot on, especially in the \"Whistle While You Work\" sequence, however they did that was amazing, it is easily the best part of the film for me. The shading is amazing too, the shadows and different tones make the film come to life. It's truly a moving painting. The music is pretty neat too, what with the score (was some of it reused or used in homage in \"101 Dalmatians years later?) and the timeless songs. Except \"Someday My Prince Will Come.\" Oh my Lord. I'll take the same stance as Grumpy on that one! Overall, \"Snow White\" does hold up pretty damn well, especially in the animation and technical department. The message, well I'm not sure if there is one, but that doesn't matter much. I mean, Snow just barges into the dwarf's house and cleans up the place, she takes the apple from Queenie-Hag after being told by her new pals not to trust anyone. Yet there's the whole never judge the book by it's cover, listen to others, don't trust strangers and be patient. The ending where hunky prince charming comes along to smooch Snow had me thinking, is he like the Grim Reaper? Carrying her up to his castle on the clouds, while the dwarfs say goodbye? The ending was more bittersweet than happy to me, which is interesting.\"Snow White\" is truly a timeless classic, and a magnificent foundation for what was to come from Uncle Walt."], ["Wonderful animation classic", "Wonderful animation classic.A Disney movie, based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale.

The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters.Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house.The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White.Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple.It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time.

The queen, after becoming jealous of her beauty which will result in taking the queen's place as ruler of the kingdom, sends his huntsman to take her far into the forest where he can kill her. When he tried to kill her, he apparently lets her go after telling her of the Queen's plan. She runs into a forest, but after making some encounters with some forest friends, they take her to a cottage where she along with the animals clean it up. Little does Snow White know that this cottage belongs to the seven dwarf men, who then find her and decided to make friends with her and let her stay for as long as she likes. Meanwhile, the Queen, having found out the Snow White is still alive, transforms herself into an old hag and makes a poison apple so she can give it to her and will result in sleeping death.For their first attempt at an animated feature that will lead to their success and create other classics, Disney has done a fantastic job and to me, I remembered watching this as a child and it finally grew out on me which is why I'm giving this a full 100%. The story is very original with an emotional feeling to it and the pacing is really good with some scenes that aren't drag. The characters are extremely likable. Snow White, although the weakest of the other Disney princess, is at least decent, the prince only appears in the beginning and the end, but was OK. The seven dwarfs are so funny. Doc, Happy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Happy, Dopey, and Sneezy are great and the hilarious moments with them are enjoyable to watch, but the only character who steals the show the most is the Queen who is by far a great Disney villain. Her motives are excellent and her old hag form scared the living soul out of me as a child. The voice acting for the characters are what I would like to say \"excellent\", but the strongest aspects goes to the memorable songs (I'm Wishing, Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho, The Silly Song, Someday My Prince Will Come) and the beautiful animation I've ever seen in any film out there today.Overall, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will always remain to Disney-fans as one of the most classic films in cinema history before MGM would later do the same thing by making The Wizard of OZ, an adaptation of L.

I also acknowledge that it has its flaws--Snow White's submissive character and her squeaky voice are often criticized. I also don't think the songs are that great, but where I will defend this movie is in its storytelling. Yes, it is a very simple plot, but that is its strength. It relies on visuals and keeps things uncomplicated, which means that very young children can understand some of the action, even if they aren't able to follow the entire story arc. It's the same reason that the first half of Wall-E gets so much praise. Both have breathtaking visuals, also--they way that Snow White and the witch move is actually more interesting to watch, for me, than almost anything else in animation. I think I read somewhere that they were rotoscoped, which is a process that has been used before and since, but for me, this is the pinnacle of what the technique can do.So many of the animated movies of the last 20 years are filled with adult-level in-jokes, sarcastic sidekicks, and rapid-fire pacing that plays to short attention spans.

The first feature length animated motion picture- yes, no doubt about it. As for the best, I'm not that sure. Don't get me wrong, I could definitely see why many people would say that this is Disney's best. For me it would be very hard to say what was Disney's best of the best but if I had to choose top 10 our dear Snow White would be amongst them. It's quite an extraordinary film, especially considering the time it was made. It features characters you're bound to bump into at Disneyland, the characters who perhaps shaped future Disney characters to come. First we have- who else but our heroin a girl with lips red as the rose, hair black as ebony and skin white as snow... did you guess yet? Of course this is Snow White, and no wonder from that description why the Queen, her stepmother is so jealous of her. The Queen in Snow White if you ask me is the coldest and one of the cruelest Disney villains to have ever roamed on movie screens. In fact she was deemed so scary that in England children under the shocking age of 16 had to be accompanied by adults to see this movie. You can clearly see the effect the Queen had on Disney villains to come, after the animators' lesson with her, no villain became as cold and scary and usually from then on the villains were accompanied by humor and sarcasm, which the queen does not have. No, she is out for Snow White and does not stop for jokes- how does Snow White dare be prettier than her?! I tell you if this Queen was to attend a beauty pageant I pity the other contestants. And so the Queen hires a hunter to kill Snow White but who (but the queen) could kill Snow White? Such a young beautiful and lovable woman? The hunter warns Snow White and off into the forest she runs and that forest scene is still one of the scariest Disney animators have drawn. Soon enough we meet the seven dwarfs whose names reflect their personalities. I always believed that everyone on earth has a bit of each trait of each of the seven dwarfs in him. There's Doc (the 'leader' of the dwarfs). There's Happy, Sleepy, Bashful and Sneezy (who I am often compared to seeing that I can probably get into the Guinness Book of Records for most sneezes). And finally there are perhaps the two most memorable of the little men- Grumpy, the grumpiest of them all and Dopey who can't speak, he never tried. Dopey is also the more childlike dwarf and the only one without a beard. But do you really think Disney could let Snow White off that easy? Nope, neither did I. The Queen soon finds out that the heart that her huntsman gave her was not that of Snow White, but that of a pig's. Well then, dear Queeny here will not let Snow White be prettier than her (even though she's living in a little house somewhere in the woods where the only people who can see her are seven tiny men... just shows how cruel this queen was). She transforms into an old peddler woman, the transformation being one of Disney's most unforgettable scenes. She tricks Snow White into eating a poisonous apple and just when all hope is lost Prince Charming comes and kisses her and she awakens and... they lived happily ever after.Flawless? No, is there a flawless movie? I highly doubt it and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is no exception, but like many other Disney movies it has very few and rather irrelevant flaws. The biggest thing that bothered me was the simple fact that the prince was to effeminate (as was the one in Cinderella but Sleeping Beauty proved that Disney could draw a more masculine prince). The songs include Some Day My Prince Will Come (a song which many girls, I know have sung to themselves), Whistle While You Work (which many people have heard so much that they have forgotten it is from Snow White). And of course who hasn't hummed Heigh Ho while in rush hour on their way to work? God knows, I've hummed it way too many times. The animation I will say is spectacular, of course more sophisticated animation was yet to come but it still remains very well- especially the animation of the evil queen. Ranks high up there, though maybe not at number one as one of Disney's greatest achievements and greatest motion pictures of all time."], ["Impressively Animated", "Snow White was Disney's first feature-length cartoon, and it's clear he wanted something that would wow audiences. The animation is ambitious and wonderfully detailed. Of particular note is the scene of Snow White running through the forest and the scenes involving the forest animals. Those forest animals are the single most impressive thing in the movie, flowing and swirling like leaves in the air, almost constantly in motion yet never unpleasantly chaotic.At the same time, these scenes have been so well parodied in other movies that at times they seem a bit absurd. Even before the parodies, there is something over the top about the dainty, domestic princess with a way with animals.For me, the movie lost a little momentum with the entry of the dwarfs, whose broad humor interested me less than the more serious earlier animation. This is not to say that the dwarfs weren't funny, in that mild, Disney way (both now and as a child I preferred the sharp, sarcastic style of Warner Brothers cartoons to the genial Disney style), but the focus on comedy meant less of a focus on pure artistry.The movie is also very much of its time. Snow White is the small-town girl ideal, a sweet and trusting princess who wanders into an empty house and immediately starts cleaning it. She has the girlish voice of Betty Boop without the attitude, and I found her a bit bland (although less so than Sleeping Beauty, many years later.Overall, this is a very entertaining movie with moments of greatness."], ["Excellent beginning!", "The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old.

Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman.Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse).Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are \"I'm Wishing,\" \"Whistle While You Work,\" \"Hi Ho,\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come.\"A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying.Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time."], ["Longing for the Days of Hand-Drawn Animation", "Watching this first feature length Disney film is a reminder that today's slick computer-generated Pixar movies come at the expense of hand-drawn artistry. \"Snow White\" is horribly dated in some ways, especially apparent whenever Snow White herself breaks into that piercing, warbly soprano to sing some very familiar songs, but there are moments in this film that will take your breath away with their sheer beauty of animation. I especially liked the wicked queen, who's really scary, and not a jokey villain like those of Disney's more modern animated films. O.k. so a single attractive female shacking up with seven smitten men would make many an eyebrow raise today, but get your minds out of the gutter, people.I can accept that technology changes, and today's animation offers many treats in its own right, but that doesn't mean I don't lament an art that has become by and large obsolete.Grade: A5 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["You've got to like it...whether you like it or not", "For almost 70 years, Walt Disney Pictures have brought you classics such as Pinocchio, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Alice in Wonderland and ...erm...The Fox and the Hound (something went wrong there). But you wouldn't have been able to be able to watch forty-three animated hits, plus many semi-cartoon classics like Mary Poppins if it weren't for the first fairy tale adaptation:SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.You've got to like it. One must appreciate it was the first of its genre. I must admit I prefered Pinocchio (the second Disney classic which followed) as a child. And that's not saying Snow White is rubbish. It's a beautiful and jolly film. It's got a lot of good points, as well as bad points. Note possible spoilers.The film opens as a white book helping set the scene that the Queen is vain and selfish. We then zoom into the Queen's bedroom in which see her see who is beautiful and if she's the sexiest woman in Cartoonland. Unfortunately, the Mirror says Snow White is. The Queen starts to show her evil by her bid to kill ther mysterious princess stepdaughter. The Queen's dialogue is beautiful, similar to that of Lady Macbeth (Walt did partially base the Queen's character on the Shakespearian villainess). The language is at it's beat in the transformation scene.The next scene is where we meet Snow White. This is where the film falls flat. Snow White is a giggly bimbo with a freaky voice. If a pop singer had that kind of voice these days, she would fade away. Since when did Britney Spear's voice vibrate rapidly in a nausiating fashion? What's more, as the film progresses, the character gets even more nausiating. Snow White is even more stupid than the Mad Maddame Mim from Walt Disney's Classic The Sword in the Stone. In the last scene where she talks, she lets a strange stranger in, despite the warnings from the Dwarfs. And that didn't get her anywhere, did it now?The Prince is equally as stupid. Unlike in Sleeping Beauty or The Little Mermaid, the Prince did not join in the Let's-Kill-The-Witch scene, which destroys his character as a Robin Hood hero and changes him into a lazy slob of a Prince.The Dwarfs, on the other hand, are loveable and believable, mainly due to the fact that everybody is like one of the Seven Dwarfs. But my favourite character is the Henchman. By keeping him out of the story a lot, he is the only fully believable true-human character. Just shows how Disney works wonders with people, doesn't it?"], ["Stained Glass", "I have a lot of complaints about Disney; what he made personally and the lumbering beast his studio has become.In particular, he murdered one of the most precious literary structures we have in Alice. But in his first big project, he did well enough to change the world. In its day, this was a rule- changer, the Star Wars of its day. Everything that happened afterward was different.Many people credit the characterizations, which Disney never did as well afterward, creating a vacuum for Pixar to fill. I admit that except for the \"swallow the soap\" trick, I liked that element.But I think there is something more fundamental at work.Movies are basically about visual notation. Its less about what the stories are than how they are told. One of the evolutions that I track is the business of outside awareness. But this, I think is something different, sort of in the opposite direction. We had comics before, where objects were not masses but boundaries. We had cartoons before, where large blobs of grey and then color defined shapes that we assigned identities to. But this has two things. They were revolutionary.The first is the narrative long form. It isn't complex; it has only one arc. We even know what the arc is and how it will end, the only mystery (for the original viewers) being in the cinematics of the thing. Disney would stumble later, on understanding the nature of long form storytelling but here he does what must have seemed impossible.The second is more visual. At the time, this seemed more natural and organic than anything that had gone before (except for the Prince \u0097 Disney always has trouble with men). We focus on the dwarfs, but the girl has mannerisms that are beyond anything we had seen before, the best being Betty Boop before the censors intervened.But there's something deeper, and to explain it, we need some history. Light is magical. Reflected light isn't very special, light like you see bouncing off a magazine page. The colors you see are dimmer than real world colors because of the strength of the light of course, but what you see is what is not absorbed. You see the leftovers. In stained glass, the light comes through, directly from the source. The colors you see are more vibrant. Ancient glassmasters formulated glass that the moderns do not, so if you have a chance to see one (like the Tree of Jesse in Chartres) you will see millions of facets in each color because of the way that the color was layered on in a \"flashing\" process, creating refractive crystal boundaries.These windows are a profound experience because of this scintillation effect that is subliminal. Like these old cartoons, the beings and objects are blobs of shimmering color with outlines that infer identity. Its a deep art that exists no where else, and not even since in stained glass.Now another fact. Snow is not white. Snow is a collection of ordered microcrystals that refract light in all colors. The combined effect adds to white, but as you move ever so slightly, you will be receiving millions of millions of flashes of pure color. And now a final fact. In 1952, when I saw this on a huge screen, the screen technology involved faceted grains of silica that had this snow-effect of micro-refraction. Today's screens use microspheres, tiny balls with smooth surfaces, so the effect is not the same. And obviously digital screens are another matter. They all preserve this \"transmitted light\" effect of stained glass, as do all films. (But the new mastering of the cartoon for DVD does increase the purity of the colors, emphasizing the stained glass semiotics.)I recently saw this on DVD, and was instantly reminded of the viewing 55 years ago, which washed over with a blizzard of snow scintillations with medieval weight, both in the story and the stained glass. I've never lost that thrill, and I wish it for you. This changed me and it changed film.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."], ["favorite animated movie of all time", "This is just astounding how beautifully animated this movie is for 1937.

If you ask me, the queen (voice of Lucille La Verne) was truly diabolical. Still, she was very attractive. On the other hand, Snow White (voice of Adriana Caselotti) was very beautiful. In addition, as the magic mirror said, nothing could hide her beauty. Also, she could truly sing. Well, despite the fact that everyone in this film could sing, Snow White was the best. This would probably be because she did most of the singing. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this charming Disney masterpiece which is very romantic to all of you who haven't seen it.

Every one of the dwarves were just so adorable but personally I fell in love with Dopey especially when he tried (and failed) to bring the soap.

She plots to kill Snow White so that she can be the fairest, but as in all Disney animated classic, good will always win, and there's a handsome prince to help. This classic fairytale still holds up today, it's great animation, ESPECIALLY for 1937! It's very fun and entertaining, complete with catchy songs and well written characters like the dwarfs. The dwarfs are: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. They all of course behave exactly like their name and they work in a nearby mine, they stroll in single file every day singing their work song, hi ho hi ho..... Snow White stumbles upon them and their cottage and she begins to stay there with her while in hiding from the evil queen. The evil queen, who is a FANTASTIC Disney villain all the while is plotting a way to kill Snow White. I love the scene where she creates an elixir that will transform her into an ugly old hag so that snow will not recognize her as she offers a poisoned apple. One of the best scenes in animated movies if you ask me. Overall everyone knows about this Disney classic and if you or your family have not seen it then what are you waiting for lol.

They all stand out in there own way, but my favourite is Dopey even though he doesn't say anything but as Walt Disney himself put it \"He's nice but sort of silly\". But that's what I like about him; he's clumsy and funny.This film is a classic in it's own way and it was one of the highest grossing films ever around the time it was first released. And it's enjoyable for both kids and adults. And it's also one of the few films that made me cry. I mean, yes, the film made me smile a lot because it's such a charming feature but the scene where Snow White is in sleeping death and the seven dwarfs gathered around her and crying is such a sad scene that it made me cry as well.

The success of this movie encouraged other companies to take this path and enrich childhoods of many generations.The movie was made in four years, two million $ was spent, and it made a profit of around 200 million and won a bunch of awards. A masterpiece of art that laid the foundation of a new genre, resisted the test of time and to this day it keeps its place at the top of best movies of all times. Despite the progress of technology, even after 80 years, few cartoons reached this level.

The title is a reference to purity and influence. It is something Walt Disney joined in favor of its seemingly mystical translation. She labors for her evil Queen mother who grows frustrated when her magic mirror informs her that Snow White is the fairest of them all. Perhaps she needs to learn how to take criticism. She orders that Snow White be killed but she flees into the forest and befriended by seven dwarfs. They each have distinguishing qualities in which their names are based. Soon the Queen tricks Snow White into eating a poisonous apple leaving a Prince to break the spell with a kiss. This is problematic because the idea of an enchanted kiss is never explained but just accepted as a romantic notion. Beautifully animated with imaginative storytelling and directing by David Hand. Adriana Caselotti voices Snow White whose wakened kissed came before over the counter drugs. Lucille La Verne steals scenes as the evil Queen. The Prince is an absolute bore. The seven dwarfs are identified by their name glitches as oppose to personalities. The huntsman refuses to slay Snow White. The result is an enchanting landmark spectacular.

Eventually, this movie would become the blueprint for their future work and, after all years, the timeless fairy tales are still their most enduring trademark. Fortunately, they have the financial means to maintain their work and this movie has been restored already a couple of times and it looks quite amazing. Of course, they would improve and/or diversify their technique through the years but this one was already quite gorgeous to look at. To be honest, even though the story was charming and the dwarfs pretty hilarious, the plot was decent but not really strong, in my opinion. For example, they spent half of the running time with Snow White getting to their home and getting acquainted with those fellows while everything involving the prince was seriously underwritten. Indeed, nowadays, this whole concept of this prince coming up from nowhere and basically saving the day seems rather hard to swallow for the modern audience (see 'Frozen' and 'Maleficent', also both Disney productions).

It was a smash hit when it was released and won a special Oscar from the Academy. While it was nominated for its musical score, none of its songs were nominated in the song category.The story is quite familiar at this point, so I'll briefly summarize it here.

But instead, the risk paid off and today, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs still stands as one of the best animation films. The film did well in the box office back in 1937 and it allowed Disney to start producing a lot of timeless classics in the years that followed.Snow White is a princess, dressed in rags and reduced to work for the evil queen, who fears the beautiful princess. The queen sends a hunter to murder Snow White and to deliver her heart in a box. The hunter can't commit the murder and tells Snow White to hide herself from the evil queen. Snow White finds a little cottage in the woods were seven dwarfs live, who work in the mines during the day, digging for diamonds, although they don't know why, as they mention in the catchy song 'Heigh Ho'. She cooks for the dwarfs and they start to care for Snow White. Even Grumpy, although he wants you to believe he doesn't. While they are off to the mine, the evil queen pays a visit to the cottage, disguised as an old, ugly beggar. Snow White is unaware of the fact that the beggar is actually the queen, so she invites her into the cottage, takes a bite out of a poisoned apple and dies. The forest animals warn the dwarfs, who chase the queen before she drops off a rock and dies. They bury Snow White in a glass coffin, because they can't bring themselves to bury her in the earth. She gets kissed by a prince, comes back to life and they live happily ever after.The first Disney Classic holds a special place in the hearts of many Disney fans and it's easy to see why that is. Snow White is very enjoyable from the start to the finish. It's not a perfect film, like Beauty and the Beast, but still, it was really groundbreaking for 1937. Just 9 years prior, Disney released Steamboat Willie and it's just unreal considering what Disney managed to accomplish in those 9 years. The animation looks tremendous. There's definitely an eye for detail, as was common with most of the early classics. I really appreciate that style of animation. Details can add a lot. In Snow White, they don't distract from the narrative, which is important. Now what really makes this film such a success are the dwarfs. They are a great collection of compelling characters. I especially like Grumpy, he brings a lot of fun to the table. The other dwarfs are memorable as well. Snow White may not be very interesting and her singing voice is the only thing about this film that feels outdated after 77 years. But her character works good enough to make for a great film.

This is what I think the best adaptation of this classical fairytale. Songs that you grew up with were probably introduced in this movie like Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work.This story really portrays the gentleness, kind-heartiness, beauty and innocence of Snow White and the silliness, humor, yet selfless characteristics of the Seven Dwarfs.

It spawned a whole new line of motion picture entertainment. It still sets the standard for animated features today. And it was a simple good story incredibly well told. Snow White herself is only mildly interesting. But give her a cast of quirky and funny side characters, and you've got a brilliant picture. Snow White does not focus solely on plot. It slowly moves along, giving room for the scenes of her interacting with the dwarfs and animals to draw us into to the atmosphere. We really get to know all of the characters well. The storyline may be familiar, but it is spiced up to create something fresh (compare it to taking ordinary soup broth and then adding a perfect combination of seasonings to make the best soup you ever had). Snow White also has some of the best music ever recorded. A lot of what Disney would later use to lesser effect in other films was birthed here: The animals who are there to give Snow White something to relate to, the animation timed out to song movements, the glorious foreground and background animation panels filmed to give a 3D effect. And the artistic detail rendered by hand in each frame is breathtaking. Only Pinocchio bettered this masterwork in terms of sheer artistry. The dwarfs naturally steal the show, but the scenes with the queen are given full weight in their creepiness. Not too scary but scary enough to send shivers down kids' spines.

A must see!"], ["The One That Started it All ...", "\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is the triumph of guts, imagination and talent, an outstanding mixture that only a visionary genius like Walt Disney could have concocted. He was told it was a folly that would bankrupt his company, no one would endure bright colors and little creatures fooling around on a big screen for more than an hour\u0085 but since when do geniuses listen?\"It all started with a mouse\" loved to remind Walt Disney, as an encouragement for people to believe in their dreams and never underestimate the magical value of the smallest creations. The road for success is paved from these little ideas, visions and intuitions \u0085 even the iconic Mickey Mouse would have been named Mortimer if it wasn't for a precious advice from Disney's wife. And starting with his iconic mascot, Walt Disney established a real laboratory on the field of animation. It was the famous 'Silly Symphonies' era that brought up to screen so many enchanting cartoons, featuring animals, trees, flowers and music in the purest tradition of European storytelling. When you compare \"Flowers and Trees\", first animated cartoon in colors made in 1932, with the unforgettable \"Band Concert\", made three years later, you realize how impressive the progresses were but when you see \"The Old Mill\", 1937 classic masterpiece of realism, you immediately get the feeling of a crucial step finally reached, and asking for something more adult, more revolutionaryMickey Mouse and the 'Silly Symphonies' contributed to the success of the Walt Disney company but what Disney needed was a flourishing empire, a bigger project that probably started with an innocent 'what if' question. Making an animated feature \u0085 think about it, in term of works, it's probably equivalent of making ten or twelve animated films with the same level of artistry as \"The Old Mill\" with the whole gallery of emotions we would expect from a film: thrills, laughs, passion, endearing characters and memorable songs. I make it sound like a 'business plan', but we're talking of the then highest grossing film of all time on which the whole existence of the Disney Company was jeopardized. If only for that, \"Snow White\" deserves all the praises for having been one of the most groundbreaking creations, on the same sensational level as \"Star Wars\", 40 years later.And Disney couldn't have thought of a better story to begin with. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is in total aesthetic harmony with the 'Silly Symphonies' (the setting, the presence of animals) and the drawing, especially of the dwarfs as cartoon characters, was the final step of what was developed during a whole decade by the Disney studios, inspired from the old classic European drawings that always had a sort of cartoon feel. \"Snow White\" stylish simplicity makes it appealing on a universal and timeless level. It can look old but never dated, and Disney proved his international ambitions by allowing the foreign animation studios to adapt the frameworks to their own language. Disney meant businessAnd the result is a triumph of both storytelling and perfectionism, Disney didn't think animation and made it into a film, he thought of a realistic film first, hence encouraged his staff to use classic designs to draw the face of Snow White, the Prince, and the Evil Queen, they might look very basic compared to Disney's following works but they're human enough to suspend the disbelief that we're watching a cartoon, an important element in order to catch the interest of the adults and awakes their inner child. And the film respected the viewer's comfort so much that the use of relief, perspective, zooming and lights and shadows was made in a constant attention to the smallest realistic details, and on that level, the making-of of \"Snow White\" is an inspirational encouragement for work and perfectionism, with dreams fulfillment as the pay-off.Another interesting aspect relies on the character of Snow White herself, so unfairly mentioned as one of the least interesting Disney heroines, when her main interest was to be a foil for the dwarfs and the villain. The dwarfs prove how intuitive Disney was for his first film, as they allowed to provide a set of seven different personalities with an almost three-dimensional value, this is the fantastic trick of the film, try to watch the other versions of Snow White, and you'll see how cruelly lacking a personality the dwarfs are. It's almost impossible to think of them without visualizing Dopey, Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Happy and Bashful. And Snow White is the central of that universe, like the emotional core of the film that justifies the dwarfs' comicality, the Prince's passion and the Queen's evilness, another aspect of the film that provides it a timeless feel. The Evil Queen embodies the combination of beauty and vanity, she's so cold, she looks like a modern woman with an undeniable sex-appeal, and if one thing, she's the very proof of the Disney Golden Rule, there's no good Disney film without a great villain.And thanks to a final and successful pacing, the rest is history and like every classic masterpiece, each scene of \"Snow White\" is a classic on its own, the forest with eyes, the dwarfs coming from home, the Queen's haunting metamorphosis, so many songs forever engraved in our memories, \"Whistle While you work\", \"Heigh-Ho\", \"Someday my Prince Will Come\" the party and a finale that would make all the people, kids or adults, in the world cry and laugh, and finally cheer \u0085 discovering the Disney effect, that for each laugh, there would be a tear, a feeling that would last for many decades over and over again.Thank you, Mr. Disney for your contribution to the world of animation, film-making and entertainment!"], ["An absolute classic to this day.", "When it comes to Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, known as the very first animated motion picture, only one word to describe it, CLASSIC!

All in all, this film can either make u cry, laugh hysterically, or, like I was when I was little, make u jump off of your pants when u see the Witch, but either way, this piece of history is something that we all should see at anytime of our lives.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Disney's first masterpiece", "Disney has been known for making animated classics like, \"The Lion King\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Aladdin\", and \"The Little Mermaid\".

Not only was it innovative and very unique for its time, it is also very thrilling, funny and spellbinding.Since this is a Disney movie, it goes without saying that the animation was absolutely gorgeous. It contains very fluid animation on top of very detailed backgrounds. It is also very atmospheric, with the mood changing from scary to happy and joyful a few times.The songs were very wonderful and catchy. The actress who voiced Snow White had a very nice and unique voice. I also thought Hi Ho and the other song the dwarfs sing were very fun and ridiculously catchy. And of course it also had a very beautiful score.Although there were some things keeping it from a perfect ten. The character of Snow White can at times be irritating in her flawlessness and purity. It felt like the prince was tacked on last minute as a deus ex machina. It seems with most Disney films at the time, the only enjoyable characters are the side characters and the villain. This movie is mostly loved because of the dwarfs. And who couldn't love those guys? They were hilarious. And the Queen was, of course, very menacing and scary.It could also be argued that the movie had a lot of filler. Almost all Disney movies were full of filler in Walt's time. But most people don't really care, probably because of how entertaining the filler usually is.This movie is definitely recommended to all animation fans, and those of us who are still children inside."], ["Despite its age still very good", "I don't know if I can say anything bad about this wonderful animation. Disney's first long animation still stands after 74 years. Although in my opinion not the best (I would give that honor to Aristocats)it's still among the top Disney movies. Considering this movie is from 1937 it's graphics have by no means become old. Although the story is simple, it does make up for that because of its entertaining characters. Thanks to Disney each of the dwarfs got a name and personality, something that was lacking in all the Snow White stories I have read in fairy tale books. The songs are unforgettable especially the hey ho song when the dwarfs go back home. As a kid I found the witch very scary and think she is the scariest of all the Disney villains. Snow White never gets old as I still enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it at 6 years old in theater. I would give it a 10 if it wasn't for the story to be that simple.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["One of my favorites, maybe Disney's all time best. It proves that beauty defeats the wicked. Heigh-Ho!", "From having watched this classic as a kid and to just recently viewing it, I must say that this picture is a timeless classic. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is an excellent moral tale of good against evil, it's a historical film as it was Disney's first full feature animated tale and it's paced along perfect with songs and uplifting scores. This film could be classified as a musical too.Originating from a Grimms tale this is a magical moral story that will entertain one of any age as it's message is timeless. The story centers around a beautiful and kindhearted princess named Snow White and shamefully she is forced to be a working slave that scrubs floors and all this comes from her wicked and jealous stepmother the Queen. Still that doesn't hide the charm that this princess has as she charms every creature in the kingdom. Interesting and somewhat of a fortune telling experiment is the Magic mirror telling the Queen that Snow White is the fairest one of all. This enrages the Queen as she has deadly plans for Snow White so it's time for this little princess to get away.Snow White goes on an uncertain journey adventure fleeing into the forest where she meets cute animals and later she befriends the odd and strange but lovable seven dwarfs named Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Sleepy and Dopey. Lessons are learned and love is developed as these little guys learn to be neat and clean and whistle and \"Heigh-Ho\" while they work at an old diamond mine! Only a favor is returned to Snow White as the Queen's wicked transformation is pushed over a cliff with help from her seven friends. And a nice beautiful return to life from the deadly apple is provided in the form of the prince's kiss. And they live happily ever after in this wonderful fairy tale.Overall one of Disney's best a good moral tale of good against evil proving that friendship helps and that beauty will win over the wicked. And the animation work was among Disney's earliest this is a highly memorable classic to be enjoyed with a loved one. So \"Heigh-Ho\"."], ["Oh to go back in time.", "It goes without saying that we have come a long way technically when it comes to animated feature films,but the thing I appreciate about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the fact that prior to it's 1937 release,audiences had seen nothing like it.If time travel were possible,I would go back and sit amongst that first lucky audience that was fortunate enough to see this.It would have made it that much more enjoyable.Kids today are spoiled by technical advances,so the animation most likely won't impress them,but they will be drawn in by it's story alone.I have a 6 year old daughter who loves this film,and even though Walt has been gone from this earth for a long time now,he is somewhere smiling at the fact that after 70 plus years,Snow White is still making kids of all ages smile.2 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Still The Most Adorable One Of All", "imagine. in 2037, 'Snow' will be 100 years old. and she's even cuter than she ever was. i mean have you ever just sat and given this film a good hard look? aside from the scary parts, the film is probably one of the cutest animated features ever made. pure cuddly enchantment.i like the Disney princess films (i know,for a guy that's so queer), i just can't help it. they are so feminine and sweet. especially 'Cinderella' and 'Snow White'. but i think 'Snow White' will always be my favorite one of all. it's definitely the sweetest. and you know what they say. if it's sweet, it's probably cute. in this case, ooky pooky snooky cute."], ["\"The One That Started It All\" Still Holds Up Well Today", "North America's first full length animated feature was a hit when it was first released, and I can say with the most confidence that it is still a hit today.The Story is about a young girl named Snow White and all the trials and tribulations she has to go through. Snow White is a \"slave\" to her stepmother, \"The Queen\"( voiced beautifully by Lucille La Verne), but while doing all her work, she thinks of a prince and a brand new life for herself. Through many different events, (such as running through a dark and scary forest) Snow White reaches a cottage which is home to seven dwarfs. I wont say anymore, but the events that happen here are truly magical and add up well to the films exciting and maybe a little scary climax.For a film made in 1937, this was quite ahead of its time. No one ever heard of someone producing a full length animated feature, and they thought the idea was completely absurd. Boy, did Disney prove them wrong! Modern film and animation owes a great deal to this film and all of the innovative things about it.If you are looking to view this film and you don't currently own it, it might be hard to track down. The DVD version of the film is in \"The Vault\"(Disney has a nasty way of doing this sort of thing) and the only way to get it would be through a site like eBay or Amazon, or seeing if any Used DVD stores or your local Video Rental Store has any to sell. An alternative would be to see it on VHS if you have VHS player and the Snow White VHS.All in all, this has to be one of my favorite films of all time, and I still like to curl up under a blanket with some popcorn whilst watching this movie.10/10= Highly Recommended"], ["Timeless?

It is the start of the medium animation, and the first of an almost continuous line of fantastic movies by Walt Disney. Does this film still hold up after almost 80 years? Of course it does.Let us begin with the animation. Even after 77 years, it still is one of the best examples of Disney animation at it's best. It is flu- wend, colorful and the use of Walt's multi plane camera (a device that created the illusion of depth) is fantastic.Because this is Walt's first feature animated movie, they use a simple story. I won't tell the plot in this review, because you all have seen this film so it is pointless to tell something that you all already know. There is no point explaining the plot because this is the kind of film in which everything else is more important than the plot.And now the characters. To be honest, Snow White is not the greatest character in this film, even Walt Disney him self sad that she is basically an plot device. I do not say that she is a bad character. she is good, but the only other complain I have with her is that her voice is ridiculously high. I have heard Adriana Caselotti in the Wizard of Oz and there she sounds normal. And now the thing everyone remembers of this movie: The dwarfs. Thy are some of the best characters ever created in any movie. The evil queen is also great, especially when she is turned into the witch.All the songs are great and fantastic. My favorites are: High Ho, the washing song, the silly song and some day my prince will come. For some reason Disney didn't own the rights of the songs ever since 1937, because it didn't have his own music department yet.It still is one of the greatest Disney movies ever, and one of the greatest movies ever.

The rest, as they say, is history. Famously said to be Disney's folly prior to release, Snow White has gone on to be one of the company's biggest earners; few, if anyone, can deny it's not the most deserving from Disney's back catalogue of being released every once in a while on different home formats. Very much a landmark movie for being the first full length animated feature, it also deserves its accolades for the high artistic quality that seeps from every frame. The advancements from Steamboat Willie ten years earlier are nothing short of incredible, the richness of the animation is a joy to behold, as the woodland creatures dart about with purpose, or the way the terror comes to life as Snow White runs thru the forest, the depth and clarity dazzles the eyes. Then of course there's the songs, most of which have formed part of pop culture ever since they were first heard. \"Whistle While You work,\" \"Heigh-Ho\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come,\" each one a standard uplifter on a dreary day.That the film is accessible to all ages obviously helped it gain universal appeal. Yes, very young kids are quite easily spooked by the darker moments that lay within, but around the corner is a treat, most notably in the form of 7 little dwarfs, each one with an identity and character that the young and old can fully embrace. One of the finest quotes I can remember about the dwarfs came from Charlie Chaplin, who straight out insisted that Dopey was \"one of the greatest comedians of all time\", and he's right of course. True enough it has some minor rough edges that time has inflicted upon it. Snow White is voiced by Adriana Caselotti, her voice is very 30s, very shrill and much too childlike for a character meant to be a young woman. Whilst she's not exactly painted in a good light, bit of an air-head is our Snow White, but to do down the film for its social portrayal of women in the late 30s would be churlish in the extreme!Pixar, presently, keeps raising the bar, as computer-perfection-animation thrills the modern day crowd. But make no bones about it, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still the benchmark animation movie. As technical advancements ensure we are wowed by this particular art form, Disneys folly watches over proceedings as the rightful lord of the manor. Masterpiece 10/10"], ["Darker than you might expect...", "The first of Walt Disney's historic features was a pleasure to watch. Beautifully animated with deceptively gentle strokes, we are delicately guided through the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale. But this is still a fairy tale and a 1930\u2032s film, made at a time where stories were not so toned down for our children, and a healthy dose of fear and horror was not shied away from.Snow White is definitely a ditsy princess, so innocent that her counter has to be the personification of pure evil and she certainly is. The Queen, represents some of our darkest emotions, and there is little effort to tone this down, which I liked, a lot. She is evil, driven by her vain jealously to firstly attempt to have Snow White murdered, and then failing that, to poison her into a narcoleptic state and have her buried alive! Is this what you now think of a s Disney film, with a U rating? No, but thanks to this and the following films successes, this is a prized classic and untouchable. I think that this is a true family movie, with as much darkness as there is light, with some great musical numbers, indelible characters and an animation style which is truly timeless.I mean this is a musical which was made in Technicolor less than ten years after the innovation of sound was introduced to black and white films. This is a film which children feel a part of and don't even compare to black and white's of the same era, which of course, they hate and don't feel are real.Hats off to Walt, who I must admit, I've never really been a fan of, but I'm working my way through his classics and am liking what I am seeing so far"], ["The first feature-length animation by Disney is a true classic!", "I loved this movie 10 years ago, and I still do. Sure it isn't the same as animation is now, but let's face it, most animation nowadays isn't very good. I can name a plethora of reasons why I love this movie. The animation is beautiful, with one or two stiff movements, but have a heart, it is the first Disney animation. The songs are mind-blowing, as well as the gorgeous incidental music(music similar to Great Expectations, 1946) that hardly anybody has mentioned. My favourite is \"Someday my Prince Will Come\", I cry every time I hear it. The characters are legendary, and the writing is top notch. Who can forget those adorable dwarfs, who added such a lot to this movie. Snow White is the weakest character but I like her innocence very much, and about her singing voice...it sounds weak, but in real life it must have been strong, and let me explain why. The colouratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci was given the praise \"a beautiful and limpid voice\" yet I heard it on cassette and it sounds quite quiet. It has nothing to do with the size of the voice, but the quality of the recording. The best character was the wicked queen, who had the most classic animation scene I have ever seen... when she turns into a hag, which freaked me out big time when I was about 9, like Malificent from \"Sleeping Beauty.\" To me the Queen is probably one of the scariest Disney villains ever. The scene at Snow White's coffin was heart-rending, and it was the music that made it so. All in all, a beautiful, funny and touching movie, and I can't believe some people hated this. 10/10.

Most people who have any kind of clue at all would say `Fritz the Cat', but they'd be wrong.  It's `Snow White'! - which received the equivalent of an X-rating in South Africa. (Parts of it ARE grisly, even if the Grimm brothers' story was more grisly still: in the story, the Queen asked for Snow White's lungs and liver - with the intention of eating them.)  This should dispel anyone's idea that the film is all cloying sentimentality.Here's another one: `Gone with the Wind' was the biggest box office hit of the 1930s, but what was the second biggest?  Oh, well, I guess everyone here knows the answer to that one.  It must be said that the second-biggest hit deserved its success far more than the first.`Snow White' can boast other things, too.  But let's not get carried away and say that in addition it's the BEST film of the 1930s, or the best animated film of all time, or Disney's supreme masterpiece, or something silly of that kind.  It clearly isn't any of these things.  Let's distinguish between `good considering that it's a first effort' and good simpliciter, and see how `Snow White' rates.Many things are good simpliciter.  Although the visual spectacle is dwarfed by that of `Pinocchio' and `Fantasia' - to name but two - it's still visual spectacle, and it still works.  Some of the special effects can still startle us.  (I have absolutely no idea how they managed to get that shot of Snow White's reflection in well, for instance.)  The art direction vividly creates a world of cosy dwellings surrounded by choking forest.  The use of colour is as marvellous and subtle as anything the studio produced after 1942 (if not quite up to the standards set by `Fantasia' or `Bambi').  In fact, every single feature after `101 Dalmations' (1961) fails to measure up to `Snow White' so far as colour is concerned.  A muted, watercolour effect (achieved WITHOUT actual watercolours) is enlivened by the rare splash of brilliance on the Queen's cape or on the poisoned apple, but there's more to it than that.  Note how we're not shown a wide palette of colours until the dwarfs appear, when it seems that every hue under the sun makes its way onto the screen.  The dwarfs are the only rounded characters, representing, between them, all aspects of humanity.  (Brilliantly animated, by the way.) It's surprising, or perhaps it isn't, that in an age in which computers allow art directors to fiddle around with the colour balance as much as they like, no-one seems to be able to use colour nearly so effectively.But there are also signs that the art wasn't yet ripe.  The most obvious one is the limited range: `Snow White' never does anything more than a particularly good pantomime might do (which is more than you might think), and while this isn't even a flaw, it does mean that the film simply can't compare with the broader masterpieces Disney produced immediately afterwards (`Pinocchio', `Fantasia', `Dumbo', `Bambi').  In 1937, Disney (and Hand and everyone else at the studio) still didn't know what to do to make a well-proportioned cartoon over an hour in length.  After the dwarfs have been around for a while the film starts to lose its way.  It even has to resort to title-card narration, indicating that while the first part of the story had been thought through properly, the rest hadn't been.  And there are minor technical difficulties throughout, with awkward animation of Snow White here, a clumsy use of the multiplane camera there.Don't get me wrong.  It's a lovely film, among the better ones the studio has produced.  We do it no service when we exaggerate its virtues."], ["The One That Started It All", "''Snow White'' was the first big and famous movie from Disney, and also the first of Disney's princesses.(She would help to start the success of all the other female characters from Disney) They took three years to produce this classic,and even being far away to be one of my favorite movies from Disney, it deserves lots of credits.

But now I have.The story is familiar - this is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Grimm Brothers' original, albeit nicely tweaked to point up (for instance) the humorous role of the dwarfs and, frankly, to pad it - there are a number of sequences which are very entertaining but not very plot relevant. The drama works well, the character design is excellent, the animation is very good (and the effects animation is stunning), several of the songs are classics (and several aren't), and there are places where it is genuinely scary, especially for small children.It's not perfect. Current audiences might find stylistic elements somewhat dated, and Adriana Caselotti as Snow White is rather irritatingly twittery.But on the whole, it fully justifies its classic status."], ["\"A fine bunch of washers you lot turned out to be!\"", "I feel ashamed that I only watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in order so that my hard, cynical heart could launch itself into an anti-Disney rant. The most sentimental of the major cartoon studios, I was determined to ravage this one after seeing isolated, treacly clips.Yet seen all together I have to admit that I was softened by a talented picture that is genuinely charming. The somewhat dated animation resembles cut outs from a picture book with its pastel hues, and looks and feels more natural than the angular, jerky computerised movement of the modern Disney features. It helps that they also employ someone who can actually sing in the titular role, with an operatic blend to the proceedings. And it would take the coldest of people not to warm to Snow White's genuine innocence. I concede, I did wince a little at the cutesy blue birds, but this is vastly more charming than I had been led to expect.It's pacy, too: whereas some of the older Disney films tend to drag (I remember catching the aptly named Sleeping Beauty one Sunday afternoon), this one is suitably brisk in its portrayal of events. And while modern cartoons (or \"Animated Features\" as they pompously like to be known) blow up the role of the \"director\", this one really has its eye on cinematic technique. Just look at the early wishing well scene, shot from the perspective of the well bottom or the blend of images and dissolves when Snow White's in the forest.Many of the songs are classics, of course. Whistle While You Work is still something you can find yourself humming or whistling while doing the hoovering, The greatest contention for me though was the seven dwarves, who always struck me as far too self-consciously cutesy and grating to really like. Yet, come on \u0096 It's Off To Work We Go is a belter, isn't it?The actual plot, which is largely sidestepped to make way for the leisurely song sequences, is more than a little macabre. Even when Snow White's heart (her severed heart!) is substituted; it's replaced with a pig's heart... and all for a family audience. I'm not saying this one is morbid, but they deem Snow White (Or Snow, if we may call her that) so \"beautiful, even in death\" that they refuse to bury her and place her in a transparent coffin. In a parallel universe somewhere there's an offshoot of this movie where the Prince arrives too late and her rapidly decaying corpse turns into a flesh-eating zombie. Maybe they should do that as one of their special straight-to-video sequels \u0096 after all, they're grave robberies, aren't they?It's a slightly strange plot, too, with Snow White spending the duration being plotted against by a bitter old Queen. And people say Elton John didn't get involved with Disney until The Lion King. Yet in order to elicit Snow White's trust she transforms herself into a scary-looking old hag? Why not just stay in her own image? And if she can transform her appearance like that, then why not use the same magic to make herself the sought-after \"fairest of them all\"? Yet I guess if she didn't then we wouldn't have a story, and the apple ofference does have some religious connotations. This is a one-note plot, though, and subtext isn't the order of the day. Rather, it's the colour and flavouring of the piece that are there to be enjoyed, not the somewhat redundant narrative. And while, after the initial thrust, the film does lose momentum slightly, enjoy it I did, a delightful and wonderfully made cartoon. Yes, you can read into the white = good/black evil assertions, but for me I'd rather marvel at the songs and images, or make cheap jokes about MOR pianists.Just two minor points: why are they called \"Dwarfs\" and not Dwarves in the film's title?

Had there been an IMDb back in 1937, I surely would have scored this one a 10--no doubt about that. However, despite being one of my favorite and sweetest Disney films, I also have to admit that the film, though wonderful, does suffer a bit on two accounts. First, Snow White's voice and singing is hellishly awful. What was wonderful for 1937 is just cringe-worthy today. Second, the ending is very abrupt and lacks depth.

Now, despite the bland characterization of the Prince-not to mention his stiff drawn movements which caused the animators to reduce his role-and the female title character only marginally better personality-wise, this is still a very entertaining initial attempt at an animated feature from the Disney studio. That's largely due to the way each of the Seven Dwarfs become charmingly charismatic in their personalities due to both movements and voices. I mean, Dopey is the perfect Harpo-like character with the way he communicates without saying a word (though we do hear him express shock and sadness when those moments appear, courtesy of Eddie Collins). Also perfect are the characterizations of Sneezy-with Laurel & Hardy player Billy Gilbert doing his iconic sneeze-and Grumpy-with Goofy creator Pinto Colvig giving his grouch a touch of likability that makes one identify with him. And Lucille La Verne is just suitably atmospheric voicing both the mean Queen stepmother of White and that Queen's later change to the Witch. While Ms. White is not a vibrant personality, she still has some naive charm that makes it understandable why the Dwarfs, even eventually Grumpy, fall for her. That's all due to her voice of Adriana Caselotti when she's both singing and speaking. It's too bad Mr. Disney didn't allow her to do any further outside work (though it's nice to know her voice can be heard in both 1939's The Wizard of Oz-as part of the Tin Man's thought-and my favorite film of It's a Wonderful Life-as a singer in the Martini's Bar sequence). Many classic sequences include the \"Heigh Ho\" number, Grumpy's bath, the Queen's transformation, and the chase sequence involving the Dwarfs, the forest animals, and the Witch Queen's attempted escape. So on that note, while I don't think this movie is one of the best animated features-Disney or otherwise-ever, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still pretty compelling as such things go. P.S. The Prince's singing and speaking voice is that of one Harry Stockwell, father of child and adult actor Dean Stockwell."], ["The Best Animated Film of All Time", "This is a simple story of friendship and courage brought beautifully to life by the master of animation, Walt Disney.

How different the world would be had Walt Disney failed with Snow White. This was the first full-length animated feature. If it did not succeed there wouldn't be any others. At least not for a very, very long time. No Pinocchio, no Bambi, all the way up to probably no Toy Story. Because if Snow White failed there would be no Disney as we know it. And if there's no Disney the history of film, animation and all of entertainment is quite different. So much of what we have known and embraced all these decades goes back to a fairy tale princess and seven of her closest, shortest friends.Considering an animation project of this magnitude had never been undertaken it is quite remarkable just how magnificent this film looks. The colors pop, the backgrounds are fabulous, the attention to detail is tremendous. The dwarfs look absolutely terrific. Brilliant character design executed wondrously by Disney's team of animators. The personality of each dwarf shines through before any of them even speak, the visuals are so good they tell each character's story perfectly. The animals, and this film's got plenty of animals, all look great. The villainous queen, in both her incarnations, is a sight to behold. Oddly, perhaps the least visually appealing thing in the whole film is Snow White herself. She's really not all that much to look at. A flat, almost featureless face. She's an iconic film character, Disney's most famous and beloved princess. But truth is she's a bit of a plain Jane. Fairest of them all? In this case the visual doesn't quite sell that story. And her prince is a bit of a dud too. But as a whole the art and animation on display here is quite terrific, and considering the laborious process by which it was created, a little miraculous.Could the world truly be captivated by a cartoon? In 1937 most people didn't think so. A five-minute short, that's one thing. An 83-minute feature? No way a cartoon could hold the attention for that long. Wrong. Admittedly there are times when the film's story does drag. Some sequences do nothing to advance the plot, they just pad the running time to an acceptable feature length. Snow White herself is not a particularly interesting character so the film doesn't really kick into high gear until the dwarfs are introduced. They give the film its personality. They give the film a song you'll be humming for hours after the film ends. They gave the film its humor but also gave it its emotional heart. The bond they form with Snow White is what allows the film's ending to pack such an emotional wallop. Yes, a cartoon can provoke genuine, heartfelt feeling. As it is that ending may be a bit rushed. The story wraps itself up and it's The End before you know what hit you. When it's over you can look back and see there is so much to appreciate. Walt Disney gambled big and won.

And the rotoscoping technique, though undeniably primitive, is remarkably effective at creating this believable fantasy world. It adds a sometimes shocking element of realism to the cartoonier characters--by God, Happy looks *real* during his dance in the 'Silly Song'--and adds a sinister theatricality to the horrible eyeless Mirror and the stooping, nightmarish witch as she shambles out of the reeds and into the fog.

If Mickey Mouse was the rock on which the House of Disney was built, then SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS was the cement that helped form the Disney conglomerate as we know it today.Rudimentary by today's standards, SNOW WHITE nevertheless remains a masterpiece of animation because it possesses two qualities totally lacking in most of today's computerized works : Heart and Soul. Despite the advancement in technology, regardless of the magic of pixels and virtual imagery, most present-day animated features lack basic storytelling skills, relying rather on the easy clever remark and an annoying tendency to preach than tell a good tale. And nothing can compare to the inspired and solid craftsmanship of Disney's original \"old man \"team of animators who bravely learned their trade while creating this nascent work of art. SNOW WHITE is the cornerstone of all of Walt Disney's greatest animated films : an involving story, characters the audience can care for and identify with, superbly drawn animation put into brilliant motion and heightened by the innovative use of the then revolutionary multi-plane camera ( a device that dramatically changed the look of cartoons, giving scenes a third dimensional look). Added to all these innovations were the remarkable songwriting contributions of Frank Churchill and Leigh Harline, responsible for the superb musical score.\"Someday My Prince Will Come\", Heigh Ho\" and \"Whistle While You Work' are just three examples of an entire soundtrack that is a model of perfection and to this day one of the great movie song scores of all time.

Will it hold up? Is it as good as I remember it? Will the re-visitation tarnish the precious memory of this film that I have?I am happy to report that, upon a fresh viewing of the first full length animated film every, that I can still declare SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS \"the fairest of them all\".Made in 1937, by the visionary Walt Disney, this film defies the odds - many calling it \"Walt's Folly\". No one had attempted a full length animated film before and the skeptics were many, but what Walt knew is that he had all the standard elements of a good story - a heroine we can root for, an evil villain, some comic characters that can help us laugh (and cry) and, more importantly, he had the skillful craftsmen of the Walt Disney Studios that can pull off such a feat.And...pull it off they did! This film is gorgeous and lush to look at. Upon this viewing, I was drawn to the background, and the edges of the frame, marveling at the detail that was interwoven into each, hand drawn imagery - giving this tapestry a lushness and thickness heretofore unseen on the screen.As for the story of the film - and the film itself - Disney was smart enough to know that \"less is more\". The film is compact - running a relatively quick 83 minutes - this was a two-fold solution. (1) It helped move the film along at a sprightly pace, never once resting or losing energy and (2) this means that the artists only had to draw what was necessary for this streamlined story.The music, of course, is wonderful and important part of this film. This was one of the first movie musicals, and was the first film to release a Soundtrack Album. From \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" to \"I'm Wishing\" to \"Heigh-Ho\" and \"Whistle While You Work\", the songs moved the story forward and added depth to the characters portrayed on the screen.If you haven't caught this film in awhile, I heartily recommend you check it out - it works for young and old alike. A good film to share with children of today, to show them what lush, hand drawn animation looks like. Come for the fun of the Dwarfs and the Villainy of the Evil Queen, stay for the richness of the tapestry and the attention to detail that a true classic film portrays.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)Next Month: WRECK-IT RALPH and (of course) the sequel RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET (coming to theaters in November)."], ["the film that started it all", "Disney rocks i would say that snow white got the better of her"], ["The first animated film", "Very good, can not be said to be the best animated film ever; But it is good and worth seeing.

Not only was it Walt Disney's first foray into feature length animated films, it was also the first full length cell animated film ever attempted. I suppose it's needless to say that the gamble paid off for him. Especially when you take into account the fact that Disney, after just buying 20th Century Fox entertainment, now technically owns about a third of the entertainment industry.Walt Disney first came across the tale of Snow White when he was about fifteen years of age after reading The Brothers Grimm tale of the same name. He later stated that he couldn't get the story out of his head and he would be constantly playing the story over in his mind. After the success of his Mickey Mouse and the Silly Symphonies series, Walt pooled everyone together and started work on Snow White in early 1934. The film was finally released in December 1937, and received a standing ovation from an audience containing that of Judy Garland. Snow White went on to do exceptionally well at the box office, and in 1939 became the top grossing sound film of all-time.Snow White at the start of the tale has been forced into the life of a scullery maid. This is being enforced by her incredibly jealous and equally vain stepmother, the Queen. This obstinately vain monarch is particularly fixated with being the fairest in the land and believes her beautiful stepdaughter, Snow White, to be a growing threat to her. Her worst fears are realised when the Queens magic mirror declares Snow White to be the fairest in the land. Overcome with jealousy, the Queen hires a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. The huntsman however is struck by Snow White's innocence and beauty, and tells her to flee into the forest in order to escape the Queens wrath. There she bumps into a company of dwarves, all with distinctive personalities and loveable quirks. The dwarves allow her to stay after learning she's on the run and especially after learning that she can cook and clean (I don't think sexism was a big thing in the 1930's unfortunately). Meanwhile, the Queen is hatching more maniacal schemes to find and kill Snow White.Snow White as a lead serves her purpose well enough. These days however she pales in comparison with Disney's latest and more stronger and self-sufficient movie heroines, such as: Moana and Frozen's Anna and Elsa. Since Snow White's only noticeable qualities is her uncommonly kind nature, naivety, and Betty Boop esc singing voice (which is also a little dated). She tends to come off a bit bland, but fortunately the dwarves more than make up for the leads short comings, and outright steal the show. The dwarves themselves all have different personalities, which are reflected in their names, in their timeless designs and exquisitely differing animations. The stand out has to be Dopey, his animation and musical cues made me chuckle a good few times. The dwarves serve as the charm and heart of the film, of which I am sure, has played a big part in this films continued success amongst children even today. I've heard a few people say in their reviews that they didn't think the Queen was a very effective villain. I can understand that point of view, especially since some of her schemes are not the cleverest. However when I watched the film as a kid I found the Queen to be absolutely terrifying, especially when she disguises herself as the old crone. I am pretty sure that I had nightmares over that old crone, and that for me has to show a definite level of effectiveness to a villain. The first thing for me that stands out is the terrific design. She looks menacing and intimidating as the queen, with her tall slender frame and pointed features. While her truly frightening design, as the old crone, allows the character to reveal her evil and deceitful ways. There is one character who gets cast aside and receives basically no development at all, and that would be the prince. He shows up a bit at the beginning and then again for the finale at the end. The problem with this is they have no interaction with each other in-between these events. This makes the relationship between the two characters very unbelievable by modern standards. Perhaps if he was given some more scenes to expand his personality a bit, or maybe even a name, his appearance at the end would not have been so jarring.The musical numbers for the most part are brilliant and truly timeless; such as \"Heigh-Ho\". This particular tune is extremely hard to get out of your head once it's ingrained itself in there. However the \"I'm Wishing / One Song\" and most others sung by Snow White herself have a tendency to sound a little dated, and as I mentioned before, a bit Betty Boop like.When I re-watched the film for this review, I couldn't help but be amazed by the extraordinarily lifelike animation that Disney and his incredible animation team had achieved. I hadn't watched the movie for a very long time and for some reason expected the animation to be, not bad, but dated compared to the more recent animated movies. Boy was I wrong. Eighty years on and it still looks practically flawless. There's nothing better than watching true masters of their craft and Disney's animators are in top form here.Apart from occasionally showing its age and having some key characters shockingly underdeveloped. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is an enduring classic that will most likely be passed down for generations to come. If you're looking to entertain your nostalgic side a bit.

Nominated for an Oscar for Best Soundtrack, this film earned to Disney the honorary statuette the following year.This film immediately won a place in history. Having been the first Walt Disney feature film, it was decisive for the evolution of what we know as animated film. Since the thirties, this movie has been in the lives of successive generations, despite having had few awards. In fact, its the definitive proof that awards don't immortalize a movie. Its ability to win public every year and persist in people's lives is, ultimately, the absolute consecration of a work of cinema.The script is simple but extraordinarily effective, adapting (almost rewriting and polishing) Grimm Brother's story. Snow White is a pre- teen girl, very naive and pure, as it was considered correct at the time (current audiences prefer a less candid approach). The Queen is the incarnation of evil and the perfect antagonist. The prince is the representation of the honest and faithful man, who saves the girl. And of course, we have the famous Seven Dwarfs, supporting characters who serve as comic element and come directly to the hearts of children, with their defects or characteristics, a rather clumsy way and a huge sense of generosity.The drawings are not as visually pleasing as will become in future films. Pencil lines are quite obvious and the colors are slightly alive. However, this technique was starting so that's something natural.

Still the most successful if you account for inflation. And there is a reason for all that success, and not just the fact that it was the first. It's the crown of Walt Disney Studios. There might be gems that shined brighter later on, but this is the base, the foundation of the studio's brilliance.And no, it's not a perfect film. You can still see that the animators were still learning away from the brief animated shorts they were more used to doing. The whole film is very episodic, with most of the time spent on general gallivanting and merriment. Especially with the dwarfs. There's a whole segment dedicated to them washing their hands. Actually, I lie. There's a whole segment AND a song dedicated to it.

I saved this for last because, let's face it, I'm a guy who's more at home with a good Western than a Disney fairy tale, and it would look pretty silly to be seen watching this picture by someone pulling up the driveway and looking though the bay window. So for this viewing, I grabbed my two year old granddaughter for cover, and casually mentioned to her mom and my wife that \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was about to begin.You know, I must have seen this as a kid because I remember a fair amount about it, especially the 'Heigh-Ho' song and the talking mirror business. Watching today I was a bit surprised by some of the scary elements in the story, starting off with the Evil Queen's command to the Huntsman to bring back the heart of Snow White in a box. I thought about that for some time, and then wondered what ever happened to the Huntsman. Someone spilled the beans about the pig heart gimmick, but the Queen never got her revenge as far as I could tell.Since everyone knows the story, I'll mention some of the things I thought about in context of the picture's release in 1937. The term 'Jiminy Crickets' was used twice in the story, but the character of Jiminy Cricket didn't appear in a Disney picture until 1940's \"Pinocchio\". Up till then, using the term was sort of a sanitized way of taking the Lord's name in vain, sometimes exclaimed as 'Jiminy Christmas'. Judy Garland's character Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\" says it when startled by the Wizard's lightning and thunder display - \"Oh! Oh! Jiminy Crickets!\"There's also the Evil Queen's use of a poisoned apple to put Snow White to sleep, reminiscent of the Bible story of Adam and Eve and the forbidden fruit. But the thing that really intrigued me was when my daughter questioned Snow White's brown eyes. I didn't think much of it until my wife joined the picture in progress about ten minutes later. She remarked on the same thing. It never occurred to me that Walt Disney avoided the blond, blue-eyed stereotype that seemed to be the characteristic of an ideal princess. I haven't read any other observations on this, so I'm just throwing it out there.Anyway, as an animated classic, this one holds up pretty well after seventy plus years, paving the way for a Disney industry that's still going strong. Considering that the animation was all done by hand makes it even more amazing - the characters, the animals, the Seven Dwarfs all come to life in a magical way that enthralled my granddaughter, keeping her rapt attention until the very end.

No, it has never been my favourite Disney fairy tale, but it has far more merits than detriments.OK, OK the titular character is about as flat as the paper she's drawn on , gratingly dense, and there's no accounting for taste when choosing the voice (It feels like they were honestly going for 12 years old, which just disturbs contemporary audiences).

Some of them are still classics and it's must better stuff when compared to some Disney movies which got made in the first years after \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", with the exception of \"Pinocchio\", which was the first next big Disney project after this one.Still just as good and watchable as it was at the time of its release.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"], ["there is something timeless and everlasting about movies like this", "\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", a film that has long been treasured and regarded with awe and amazement by audiences for seventy long years. Whether or not the viewer knows about the incredible painstaking work it took to make the animation in a film like this convincing enough for us, we do still look at the film and enjoy it despite the fact that its animation and style is far outdated. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is short, wonderful, and unique. Had it been made today, it may not have worked out. First of all, it would have had to be longer and with more interaction between several of the characters.However, there is something classic and timeless about \"Snow White\" which still works today. While I do strongly believe that the love story, although a major point in the plot, was exercised weakly onto the screen. The real reason for this is that the prince, whose name is never revealed, has such little screen time. I estimate about three minutes, maybe less. In my following research, I discovered that it was because of the incredible difficulty the animators found in drawing in frame-by-frame. That's how it was done back then.Putting aside the flaw with the character of the prince, the other characters were very well-done with both animation and development. Snow White is well-realized in looking innocent, kind, and depending on one's point-of-view, a beautiful Disney character. The seven dwarfs, the other title characters, were also well-done and they are the real stars of the film. Snow White provides the drama and heart-felt sympathy, while the dwarfs provide everything else except for antagonism. But they are the characters who make us laugh, or at least grin. And each is given a specific personality which makes them memorable. The evil queen, the villain of the story, is one of the coldest that Disney studios ever pulled out. Whichever physical form she is in, the queen, also unnamed, is a ruthless baddie. Her horrifying personality and decisions ultimately earned her a place in the Top 50 Villains of film history.So while \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" is an old, outdated film which does not always meet the expectations of audience members today, there is something about it that does work. It has been selected for preservation by the Library of Congress. I myself think it is worthy of such a position. I don't really know why, it's just a wonderful animated film in its own right. I liked it as a kid. And recently, I saw it again for the first time in years. It proved out to be more effective than I thought it as going to be. It just shows that films like this will probably last forever."], ["Magic Mirror, on the wall, which animated feature film is the greatest one of all?", "Contrary to common belief, Walt Disney's 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is not the earliest feature-length animated film. This title goes to Quirino Cristiani's now-lost 1917 Argentinian film, ''El Ap\u00f3stol / The Apostle.' Even as far as current availability in concerned, you can turn towards Lotte Reiniger's 'The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926)' for a brilliant animated film, featuring endearing silhouette animation and an exciting tale of heroes, villains and monsters. Released in 1937, 'Snow White' was Disney's first feature-length effort, as well as the first technicolour animated movie, and also briefly the most successful film of all time (until the release of 'Gone with the Wind' in 1939). After the excellent 'Fantasia (1940),' this was the second feature-length film I'd seen from Disney's early era, and I was instantly able to appreciate why it is so revered. One can only imagine how much effort must have gone into the 83 minutes of animation, and, despite this relatively brief running time, the film manages to flesh out so many wonderful characters and effectively evoke a range of emotions.The story is roughly based upon the German fairytale by the Brothers Grimm. A beautiful and wicked Queen (voiced by Lucille La Verne) learns one day, through her Magic Mirror, that her stepdaughter \u0096 the beautiful Snow White (Adriana Caselotti) \u0096 has surpassed her in beauty. Enraged, the Queen orders the princess murdered, but the kind-hearted servant cannot bring himself to commit the act. Abandoned in the forest, Snow White is aided by the gentle animals of the forest, and she stumbles upon the modest dwelling of a group of seven dwarfs, respectively named Doc, Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Happy and Bashful, each with a personality that mirrors their own titles. Though initially hesitant about having a woman in their home, the little men eventually come to appreciate her presence, and all is going well until the Queen learns of her servant's disloyalty, and so crafts a new and terrible revenge for the sweet and innocent Snow White.Visually, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is nothing short of a masterpiece. Compared to the primitive cut-out silhouettes of 'The Adventures of Princess Achmed' just a decade earlier, the animation in this film is nothing short of staggering; every single frame is simply alive with vibrant colour and movement. In fact, the film proved such a monumental advance in the field of animation that it took until the arrival of Pixar Studios and CGI before anybody truly progressed beyond what had been achieved here. Colour is used magnificently to create intense moods, and the chasing of the Queen (transformed into a witch) through a raging thunderstorm is an absolute triumph of film-making, equal to anything produced before or since. Notably, a flawless 1937 Silly Symphonies short, 'The Old Mill,' served as an essential testing ground for many of the techniques used in 'Snow White,' including the animation of animals, rain, wind, lightning, ripples, splashes and reflections. Additionally, 'The Old Mill' also served as the trial-run for Disney's revolutionary multiplane camera, which was also used to remarkable effect here."], ["The beginning of the Disney motion pictures", "Walt Disney produced many full-length animated features during his long career, and many more have come from the Walt Disney Company since his death in 1966. However, the very first of them all was \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", an adaptation of the version of the story from the Brothers Grimm. This 1937 motion picture turned out to be groundbreaking, and although seven decades have passed since its original release, it is still remembered as a classic, well-deservingly!Snow White is a princess, and the stepdaughter of the evil, vain Queen. One day, when the Queen asks her Magic Mirror \"Who is the fairest one of all?\", she doesn't get her usual response! Instead, she learns that Snow White is now the \"fairest one of all\"! The Queen immediately grows jealous, and sends a hunter out to kill Snow White! Luckily for the princess, the hunter decides that killing her just wouldn't be right. Wanting her to live, he tells her to run away, which is just what she does. Looking for a place to stay, she ends up in the house of the Seven Dwarfs (Dopey, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful, Grumpy, and Happy), and begins to live with them. Meanwhile, after the Queen learns that Snow White is still alive, she intends to do the killing herself!This was one of many Disney films that I saw when I was a kid, but my memory of it wasn't as clear as some of the others. A few months ago, I watched it for the first time in many years, and didn't think much of it. However, I was more impressed when I watched it again shortly after, and even more impressed with a third viewing! I found Snow White's singing voice somewhat annoying at first, and with more viewings, I still didn't become a big fan of it. However, this certainly didn't totally ruin the film for me. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" has some good dialogue (some of which I may not have noticed before), excitement, and memorable characters (including Snow White, even if she's not the greatest character in Disney history, along with most of the Dwarfs, who often add humour to the film).After my most recent viewing, I'm not sure whether to give \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" an 8 or a 9 (out of 10, of course). I certainly wouldn't give it a 10 (it's not absolutely perfect in my book), but I was very impressed with most of it. I don't know whether it was enough for me to give it a 9 rating or not. Well, nonetheless, I can still understand why this first full-length piece of animation from Disney has been labelled a classic by so many people throughout the decades! For hardcore fans of Disney or animated family adventures in general, and probably for some moderate fans as well, there's lots of fun to be had!"], ["A beautiful movie with great set pieces", "I'm with a lot of people, in that I think Snow White as a character is too much of a stereotype to be really interesting, but at least she's not the princess in Gulliver's Travels!What really makes this movie is the artistic animation, which does exactly what animation is supposed to do: create feelings through moving images, not create a realistic world.  When Snow White flees into the forest, we see what she sees--that the whole world is suddenly out to get her.  The trees come to life in demonic fashion, and the floating logs become crocodiles.A note on the songs--while today in America it seems kind of silly to have songs about working and cleaning, work songs have been a part of nearly every culture throughout history.  If you watch the subtitled version of Hayao Miyazaki's \"Princess Mononoke\" or Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai,\" you will hear examples of Japanese work songs.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Superior to the Cartoons released today by Disney Studios", "A beautifully colored and wonderfully depicted story of the Snow White tale. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs(1937) is one of the few Walt Disney pictures that I think is any good.  Tends the water of fairy tale and horror.  This is the film that is what many Disney films have tried to live up to and some failed.  A very good film that is made special by the early use of Technicolor.  Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs(1937) made an impression on many Italian horror filmmakers who would use this impression to do some of the best Italian horror films ever.

Well, while it is a huge achievement, especially for 1937, it IS a little thin on story.Set in a European-esque fairytale world, Snow White is the pretty young Princess living under the shadow of her evil stepmother the Queen. Envious of her beauty she orders her huntsmen to lead her out into the woods and cut her heart out. He gets the first bit right, but chickens out on the actual heart-cutting. Instead he banishes her to the woods where she promptly invades a private home, claiming it for herself, and enslaves the forest animals to do her bidding.When the rightful owners return they are first alarmed but then happy to have a woman living in the house to seize their passions and cook their dinners. I assume that all dishes served in Casa De Dwarf are all vegetarian since we never actually see Snowy kill, skin, and butcher the animals that she has enslaved.Eventually the Queen learns that Snowy is still alive and aims to kill her with a poisoned apple (that can be reversed by a kiss from her true love). Why she doesn't just slit her throat or burn the house down is beyond me.There are not really enough developments in the story to maintain the 83-minute running time, with a lot of space devoted to singing and rhythm-timed animation in the style of Silly Symphonies. But the animation, and especially the backgrounds, are wonderful to look at and really do create an atmospheric, beautiful world. It's a shame Disney didn't indulge in them more.Still a classic, but perhaps a little too quaint from a modern point-of-view."], ["An animation classic", "I admit that this film has a couple of flaws. The music is not too good and (of course) the animation is not too good. But you have to see it all in perspective. This film was made about 65 years ago and I think it is a great accomplishment that the film can entertain people (including me) even now. I mean I'd rather watch this film (which is not perfect technically regarding today's standards) than watch Godzilla, The Avengers or Mission to Mars again. I honestly must say that the theme of the film has an approach that is well kind early 20th century but hey that's when it was made and although I didn't like that aspect very much I still enjoyed this film more than I did 2001's Artificial Intelligence (just to name one). The execution of the theme might be a bit old as may the animation techniques, but the good thing is that great humoristic scenes never lose their effect. My favorite dwarf? That's easy DOPEY.

I don't know what achievements world cinema had seen in Animation by 1937 when Talkies were running riot at Box Office and Award shows but i know this that Walt Disney brought Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and changed Hollywood cinema forever. I don't need to mention how Animated classics have been loved over the years but it is important to acknowledge that it all begun with this film. Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is so amazing, beautiful, amusing and sweet film that i just couldn't hate it for moment. A fairy tale with fine touch of realistic world doesn't fumble at all and becomes a nostalgic mania. The story itself is so fascinating as we meet a Young and charming Princess who works as a Maid in her own palace because of her stepmother, a vain queen. She falls in love with a handsome Prince then runs away and starts living with Seven Dwarfs in the hills but cruel fate doesn't stop chasing her. I must say, the originality and completeness of the writing made many people to borrow the elements and bring stuff inspired from it. It has been influential for years and will remain so forever because such captivating stories will always work in any era. Creators put all the creativeness and innovative ideas into presentations and how? Possibly upto the last level of thinking of how could you present this scene with magical yet fascinating way. I genuinely felt what else could you derived in cinematic Liberty than this? So freaking awesome it is. Music is fantastic and pleasing which has the legacy for valid reasons. One of the biggest victory for the makers is speeding of the film because audience was experiencing something like this for the first time and if it had been slow and glide then engaging factors would have faltered. Fortunately, the film doesn't have a single useless and boring scene that can be overlooked or skipped even in repeat watch. Direction is just perfect I don't know how to explain it as i am not a kid but still enjoyed it like a kid. The commercial succe of this film was needed or else Hollywood would have never dared to make more Animated flicks and we would have missed many classic films. Nowadays we have so many animated films with innovative and highly intelligent ideas but what Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs archived 8 decades ago is REMARKABLE !

It is years since I've watched Snow White.What a difference!This is an actual, proper attempt at a meaningful film, not some marketing or pandering exercise with paper thin intent, tiresome & predictable design & characters, and an OD of sugar or saccharine. Very refreshing.It feels far more like the masterpieces of animation that are still possible in Japan and were possible with Pixar but which Disney's shallowness has made impossible from them in decades.The quality of animation of figures has a naturalistic movement that is simply so far ahead of current Disney it isn't funny. And the backgrounds. Even with modern day computing power recent stuff is weak, while the second half of the 20th century stuff is just plain cheap and childish in comparison.There is also actual atmosphere. The noirish shadows, the angles, there is genuine foreboding.Pus it thankfully, so very thankfully, doesn't suffer from the pregnant pause face shots and poses that plague ends of scenes of so many of today's productions, animated or live action. If anything the transitions move a couple of seconds too quickly. But I'd still far rather have this older style of film making than the soapish current vogue.The music is also wonderful. I don't know whether they work because I've heard them all my life or because they are actually good. But they do.So, after all that, why not a 10? For 2 reasons.1) Snow White herself. She is so matronising and privileged. Not a pleasant characterisation. The singing voice is also rather twee.\n2) The denouement simply isn't believable.If this film was made today like this I'd probably mark it 8, but given when it was made it deserves more, so a 9.Wonderful."], ["lovely", "The princess in the film loves labor and is an image of a laborer from beginning to end\nI am optimistic and kind in the face of adversity and have always been confident in the future\nStill a great mom or aunt in kindergarten\nAbility to let a large group of children obey the command without pressure\nAdded a large group of various small animals in the forest\nMake the picture lively and cheerful\nEach dwarf is assigned a name, each with its own characteristics\nAdded the wisdom of the princess0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Disney starts off with a bang!", "Who knew that the first Disney feature film would be one of the best?

Without it, who knows of we'd ever get animation as we know it today, since these things were unimaginable back then. And that alone makes it worthy of some mad respect! And the fact that it holds up so well to this day only furthers that point.Now, I like 3D animation, but I prefer the old-school, 2D animation style. And this really looks gorgeous, especially considering the time it was made. There's not as much work put into backgrounds compared to some later Disney films, but the backgrounds still look like paintings anyway. The movements look pretty nice too, except for the prince looking a bit odd, but supposedly he was really hard to animate. The characters themselves are pretty likeable too. Some might find Snow White annoying because of her high-pitched voice, but I think she's adorable. This Snow White is THE Snow White, as she will probably be the first to come to mind when you mention the character. And while there might be seven of the dwarfs, not one of them feels pushed aside and each one manages to have his own distinct personality in less than 90 minutes, which is kind of an amazing achievement when you think about it. One (Grumpy) even has a character arc which actually enhances the emotion largely in some scenes near the end, I'd go as far to say that he's the overlooked emotional drive of the third act, just not put into focus of the situation. Let's take a look at the human characters now. Snow White is a Mary Sue, there's no denying that. But this was the first Disney princess, I think we can forgive that. Same goes for The Prince, but he's actually barely in the movie, so does it really matter? The Evil Queen is such an iconic villain in both of her forms throughout the movie and sets a high bar for Disney villains yet to come, a bar that still managed to be surpassed. The Huntsman has something unique to him as well, but he's not much in the movie either. There is, however, one side character that I found very mysterious and intriguing: The Magic Mirror. It's creepy, has an incredible design and oozes with mystery. The story is pretty thin and slowed down by random scenes that feel like filler, but hey, they are a fun filler that helps develops the personalities of each of the dwarves. And keep in my mind that Disney was starting out with storytelling, so it needed some time to improve. However, this movie isn't so much about what is done, it's about how it's done. And don't even get me started on the ending, which I consider among the greatest of all time. With barely any talking at all, it mostly relies on the technical aspects. Haunting music leading to a triumph and heavenly imagery that makes the eyes pop out, it's a thing to behold and might even tear you up a bit if you're a nostalgia freak.While it's not a perfect movie and it has its flaws, its charm and the fact that it's a cinematic milestone makes it more than deserving of a 10."], ["Disney's masterpiece", "Where to start?The immortal story,the musical moments,characters,voices a big triumph for Uncle Walt!0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Snow White, and the Seven Stars", "Great job for the first animated film!

Such a slogan would be meaningless to 99% of today's readers (and absolutely risible to the other 1%).Since the 1950s, cartoons and comic strips have generally been regarded as third-rate fodder for children. However, there are always riders to every sweeping statement. The exceptions here are Fantasia (especially in its 1970's re-issue when it was taken up by the hallucinogenic generation) and \"L'il Abner\" which enjoyed a surprising bout of adult popularity in the 1960s and 1970s.In my childhood days, the comic strip and the comic book were regarded as less than praiseworthy amusements that older children were encouraged to out-grow; and the theatrical cartoon was a mindless diversion for backward youngsters whose limited attention spans were incapable of taking in a whole feature like Lassie Come Home or National Velvet.In my home town, the situation was even worse. There was never a cult following for Tex Avery, and adult cartoons like Fritz the Cat fell flat at the box-office.Despite his macabre humor, Disney was always regarded as strictly for kids. Adults couldn't care less whether Mickey Mouse had three fingers or four, whether Bambi lost a hundred mothers, whether Snow White lived or died. Because I loved cartoons, I was regarded as brain-damaged or eccentric. Often I found myself the lone adult in an audience of irritable children who found films like \"Dumbo\" way above their heads.I have similar happy memories of Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Gay Purree, The Lady and the Tramp, Ichabod and Mr Toad and Mr Bug Goes To Town. (Hey There, It's Yogi Bear, and A Man Called Flintstone, I loathed. I felt they were designed for mental zombies!)However, the animated feature I love best of all is Snow White. It's a film I can enjoy over and over. Snow White herself may be a bit pallid, but the Wicked Queen and the seven dwarfs are brilliantly characterized. The songs are a joy, the animation often dazzlingly inventive, the colors and compositions a visual delight. The story has pace, charm, atmosphere, humor and excitement. If you are immune to its call, and if its music doesn't stir your soul, you're missing one of the seven wonders of the cinema."], ["Sad to say, I have never liked this movie.", "It's not a \"bad\" movie. The animation is beautiful, the songs aren't too bad either. The story is alright. I just find the characters really boring and that's why it's hard to really like any of them. Snow White is so delightfully sweet and just way too cutesy for my liking. She comes of as almost too flawless which is annoying. The Prince has no personality (or name?) except prancing around being romantic. I never found the dwarfs very entertaining either. I found them mostly annoying and I did as well when I was a child, so I never enjoyed watching this movie even when I was young.The pacing of the movie is also a big problem for me. So much time is spent on walking around, looking at things, investigating at snail-pace. Fine if the characters look around the house for a while, but I swear Snow White sometimes stops for five minutes just to comment a chair or something.6 out of 20 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Setting the bar for animation", "Now I don't want any hate mail (just kidding I do...I love getting emails) but I am scoring this beloved classic a 6. Not because its a bad film, no movie that is considered a stone cold classic and the starting point of one of the biggest film heavyweights in history could be a \"bad\" movie but I review my films on entertainment value to me. I could list pros and cons for this film all day and all night because I feel like it has a lengthy list in both columns. On one hand if you look at it from its conception date in the late 1930's, it is brilliant, breathtaking animation. The artistic value on this film is a 20 out of 10. Still today you have to marvel at the beautiful hand drawn art and characters. But you could argue against me until you're blue in the face but I believe this is a movie that could have been told in ten minutes. They drag it out and there is many scenes in the film that are simply too long. Its an extremely dark film (as many of Disney's adventures tend to be) so much so that I personally wouldn't let very young children watch it. And while most of the songs are iconic and lovely, they are far from the best in the Disney animation classic repertoire.Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs created some of the most iconic well known figures in animation history or film history for that matter. Out of all the Disney princesses I have always felt that Adriana Caselotti was the least impressive of the bunch. There are times when her singing voice is almost irritating like sandpaper and her tones are off in various scenes. I don't know why Walt Disney took such a liking to her but she didn't do much else outside of this so I think I may be closer to hitting the nail on the head than you would think. Lucille La Verne is very good as the evil Queen cementing her place in animated villainy quite purposefully. I felt like in this most recent viewing that she was actually almost underused in the film but she does get some terrific and terrifying scenes. Each one of the seven dwarfs are fantastic. They all have such unique (albeit blatantly obvious) personalities. Everyone will find their favourite and while some get more scenes than others, they are terrific. Harry Stockwell as the Prince...well I can't say much of anything about his performance because he is probably the most underused Prince in Disney history. There is no build up to their romance and every scene he is in is very rushed and forced.That is perhaps my biggest issue with the film. So much of it dragged and too much time was spent trying to fill empty void in an effort to make it feature length and then when you hit the climax of her eating the apple...it rushes right through to the end and credits are rolling before you even know what happened. The last ten or fifteen minutes are far too rushed and compact. This film holds its credibility because of what it did for Disney studios and animation and the characters that became so iconic. The six directors that worked on this film deserve most of that credit because it really is a beautiful film to look at. Even the background of each sequence is just lovely. For me, it was a bit of a dud in a few ways but I can appreciate artistic beauty and this film is full of that at the very least. 6/10"], ["Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", "This is the very first of the legendary Walt Disney full length animated films.

The animation is stunning, the music is timeless, and so on. To be honest, each scene is more heartwarming and cozy than the last. Besides the first and last five minutes of the movie, nothing bad really ever happens to the main characters. That's a refreshing change. If I have any gripes with the movie, it's that dumb Prince Charming guy. We first see him when he creepily sneaks up to Snow White and startles her. Snow White obviously flees, and Prince Charming has the nerve to be surprised. What a dope. Snow White then fantasizes about him for the rest of the movie (for some reason) until he shows up again at the very end. Somehow, he's even stupider by then. He kisses Snow White's corpse on the lips. A few things are wrong with this. First of all, I'm pretty sure that's illegal, for a number of reasons. Secondly, corpse germs are a real thing. Once Snow awakens, she runs off with him into the wilderness. I'm pretty sure he kills her, because we never hear from Snow White again. There's not even a bad Disney sequel about her. Now you might be wondering, why does Snow like this guy in the first place? Well, apparently she's only fourteen, so I guess it's just her teen hormones tricking her mind. Also, apparently there were supposed to be a bunch more scenes of Prince Charming in the middle parts of the movie that just didn't make the cut. I guess Walt realized that the Prince is such a simple transparent character that we didn't need any more scenes to explain his motivations. Anyway, besides it's little kinks, the movie does hold up incredibly well in the 21st century, especially considering it was made in the freaking 30's. The (mostly) lovable characters, along with the brilliant talents behind the scenes, make Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs one of the greatest Disney, nay, one of the greatest FILMS of all time. It's certainly the most watchable 30's film by today's standards. P.S.

Before this of course was Steamboat Willie(which is now used in the Walt Disney Animation Studios as its logo). Everyone knows what this film is about,a young princess named Snow White is threatened by her evil stepmother the Queen who wants her dead(cause she wants to be the fairest one of all)so Snow White hides out in a nearby cottage with her animal buddies to keep her safe and its turns out that the cottage belongs to seven dwarfs including Dopey,Bashful,Sleepy,Sneezy,Grumpy,Doc and Happy(all these are personality traits that each dwarf has).

The Wicked Queen is, well, a little more interesting, but the very idea of being willing to kill someone for being better looking than you is ridiculous, speaking of which, the whole film is sexist.

This was a full length color feature a full year plus before Robin Hood (1938). That and the popular Walt Disney who had already established himself in cartoons is why this became a land mark Disney film for many years.Being the first however, the film now faces many of the draw backs that another Disney Feature, Song of The South, now faces. It is totally based upon a Fairy Tale & the Snow White children's tale has not aged well. The story in todays contemporary is now considered sexist.

It has an unintentional negative message for children in the ending as well.Still, this movie is important & not just as a historic first. This movies success is a primary reason that the 1939 Wizard of Oz was produced. Because this film sold so many tickets was a major reason for the way Oz was produced & why MGM spent so much money & time producing it 2 years later.

Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that\u0085)Ahhh\u0085 Number one. Snow WHITE and the seven \"little men.\" Like Walty Boy isn't trying to say something there. Don't count him out of adding subliminal messages throughout his works. And I'm not just talking about the Little Mermaid's Little Penis. I'm talking even smaller, as in using the phrase here \"Jiminy Cricket\" (repeatedly) or his hatred for things, well, not (snow) WHITE.Admittedly, I'm not the hugest fan of this animated film. Sure, it's groundbreaking, for 1937, and against all odds, they made the first (of thousands) of feature-length animated films. Keep in mind: just because a movie's a milestone doesn't mean it equates greatness.Example? Episode IV, A New Hope, formally just plain Star Wars. Sure it was ahead of its time, light-years, in fact, but wasn't it a fraction of the movie, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, formally just plain Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back?Why was this, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, not the \"Great\" movie tons of critics attribute it to be? Oh, I don't know\u0085because there's a lot of racism in here \u2013 from mocking the Chinese to the Native Americans? Because the lead singer (and voice) of Snow White sounds like she's sucking on chestnuts (not the dwarfs, I hope) whenever she opens her lips? Or is it the painful pacing?That last one got me. Sure, they wanted to make the first full feature length cartoon, but it still felt like a couple-of-minutes-long short stretched far too long in most scenes. It is said, in the truthful, and masterful sometimes Walt Disney-HIMSELF!, commentary on the DVD, that Walt wanted only scenes that enhanced the character development. Unfortunately, it still felt like scenes dragged longer than they should.I'll give it creativity. It's beautiful for what it was trying to be. It's also VERY adult. There's more than one scene of someone trying to kill someone else. Only, the Queen's evil plan was a little misconstrued. See, she sends her minion (apparently, she's just got one servant) to kill Snow White so the Queen can retain the \"Fairest of them all\" status. But then, she spends a good portion of screen time to transform into an ugly hag in order to trick Snow White into eating an apple and fall asleep. Luckily the writers caught the obvious flaw of a cure, but not the fact that there were plenty of opportunities for the witch/queen to simply stab the beauty instead of just putting her to sleep.More things that irate me: Grumpy, apparently one of the \"main characters\" \u2013 due to a higher amount of screen time than many of the other Smurfs in the movie, is a dick. Plain and simple. Sure, he evolves and Snow White spends a good portion of the movie attempting to get him to like her. But, he's still a nasty character in any lighting. Also, the extremely over-dramatic Snow White is no princess\u0085she never, EVER, shows appreciation for any of the nice things anyone does for her. I.E. the animals bend over backwards to find her shelter. She never, ever offers or says: \"thanks.\" The dwarfs care more about her than themselves in many occasions, such as places to sleep or when she \"eternally\" sleeps, and when she awakes, it's all about her wishes. Bitch.For die-hard Disney fans, it's a watch. It's not terrible; it's a good beginning and despite its flaws, I'm glad they (and the box office) had faith in Walty Boy to grant him further production deals, leading up to Disneyland, et al.

The titular dwarfs don't make an appearance until much later than I had expected. Their uniquely descriptive names call attention to the only character traits any of the characters have. Snow White is hardly a character. Like the dwarfs, her name is a description; unlike them it is a descriptor of her appearance, not her personality.\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" must have looked like magic up on the big screen in 1937 for adult and child alike, but nowadays there's just not enough going on on screen to hold our attention.

I can't call this a timeless masterpiece of anything like that, but I appreciate it. Since this movie was probably the pioneer for other good and great Disney films. I think the only thing that stood out for me when it comes to this flick was the \"Heigh Ho\" part where the dwarfs are singing while going back home from mining.

Or when the title characters watched it in \"Gremlins\"?", "Since everyone knows what happens here, I'll talk about a few aspects. In the Grimm brothers' original version, the dwarfs didn't have names; Disney added those and the respective personalities. Also, whereas here the dwarfs are slobs, in the original story they were very tidy - so why did they need Snow White to be a housekeeper? Today was the very first time in my life that I watched the whole movie (and I only watched it for a class). The first time when I saw any of it was in \"Gremlins\", when the mean green guys watched it. Also, I remember once on \"The Brady Bunch\" when the Bradys put on a production of it in their back yard to raise money for a retiring teacher.One thing that comes to my mind is the fact that there are seven dwarfs. We all like to say that seven's the lucky number. Considering the names and personalities given the little guys here, one could infer that they represent the seven deadly sins: Grumpy is anger; Sleepy is sloth; Sneezy is greed (maybe he thinks that everyone owes him something because of his excessive sneezing); Bashful is lust; Doc is pride (if he's smarter than the others, he must be full of himself); Happy is gluttony (you may recall that he's pretty fat); and Dopey is envy (maybe he wishes that he was as smart as the others and talk like them). Expanding on this, maybe the dwarfs correlate to the characters on \"Gilligan's Island\": Gilligan is Dopey; the Skipper is Grumpy; Mr. Howell is Sleepy (he'd rather sleep than do work); Mrs. Howell is Sneezy (she seems like the type who's allergic to many things); Ginger is Bashful; the Professor is Doc; and Mary Ann is Happy. Speaking of dwarfs in general, I think that dwarfs are people whose limbs or other body parts are disproportionate to the rest, so the men here would be midgets.Oh, wait a minute. I haven't even mentioned Snow White. Well, we all know that she's benevolent beyond credibility - and she's rather flat-chested for a grown woman. Watching the movie in this day and age, a person may feel tempted to throw out comments like on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". When Snow White looked down the well, I said that it was like \"The Ring\", and when she entered the dwarfs' house, I suggested that she was guilty of breaking and entering.So, that's my take on \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\".

It won't be all adventurous and complex like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, but it's simple and lighthearted (a good path for Disney's first movie).I got to be honest with you, but I can't stand Snow White! Her voice is do pitchy and annoying. She's so naive and sweet ugh! If I want a princess being my role model; I would turn to Belle for a Disney princess. I just don't like her. The Evil Queen is a lot prettier than Snow White. The Queen is one of my favorite Disney villains alone with Scar and Ursula. The Queen may have awful plans to become a hag (she should have turn Snow White into a hag instead of herself), but she's a ruthless and cold person in and out. She's arguably the best character that this movie has to offer. Second place are the woodland animals and third is the boulder.The animation looks really good, even from 1937. I really like the colors that the animators used and it looks nicely done. No CGI was used to animate this movie so don't expect Snow White to look like Rapunzek or Princess Fiona from Shrek (her ogre form is prettier than Snow White is). And the scene with the Queen's transformation is nicely done- if this was done by hand, why can't animators these days draw backdrops and things and such?

Snow White wasn't really made as a kid's movie it was made as a family movie perhaps, but was definitely aimed at a more adult audience (and parts of it are scary for kids) with the peculiarity that it is animated. When you watch Snow White you are watching an art that was almost better in it's infancy that in it's so called adult hood, now there are few hand animators left and instead of sweating over a flip board they are hitting buttons on a computer...and it's missing something somehow. This will always stand out as a dedication to Walt's true dream, and hopefully it will hold forever."], ["Great at times, but not the perfect Disney cartoon", "Yes, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was the first full-length animated feature and yes, it does look tecnically beautiful, but I feel that it isn't the best Disney film (that honer goes to \"sleeping Beauty\"). There are reasons why I don't like it a lot (Spoilers might be coming).First off, the queen (voiced by Lucille LaVerne) is one scary villian. Scary enough to even scare the s*** off a grown-up. The queen's transformation is still one of the scariest scenes I have ever seen in a animated film. When the queen is around, the movie turns into a dark fantasy and it overshadows the child-like elements of the film.But the scene I hated the most was the \"Heigh-Ho\" sequence. For me, the scene just didn't do it for me. It is a scene that seems more like it overplays itself. This scene could have been two other things. We could have just heard them talking or they could have gotten rid of the scene altogether and used the deleted \"Music In Your Soup\" number. For almost eleven years, I was scared of this scene until I saw \"Gremlins\" recently where they used this scene. I wasn't afraid anymore, but I was unmoved by the scene.But I did say it was great at times and it is. This is mainly evident in the film's conclusion. It's conclusion is well thought out and in the end, it pays off big time and it shows. I wasn't even disturbed by the title-card narration. I actully thought it was quite inventive , but the title-card narration was actully animated and it was not used for almost the same reason the \"Music In Your Soup\" sequence was deleted. Due to time. Walt Disney himself said in 1955 on his television show that it was cut due to this very reasonThere was only one scary sequence I liked and it was when Snow White went in to the forest. Another good sequence involves the dwarfs washing up. It is very funny and interesting. The climatic chase sequence between the Queen and the dwarfs is easily the film's best scene and the scene where the queen poisons Snow White with the apple is made great by its trick photography.In the end, I have mixed feelings about the film. Some scenes are great while others fall flat on their face (like the \"Heigh-Ho\" sequence), but under its many flaws, it is still a very good film, but its not the greatest of them all. I might be 15 years old, but I like the film anyway.But it still gets a good rating from me *** out of ***** or 6/10"]], "Pinocchio": [["When \"Pinocchio\" came out it was suddenly apparent that \"Snow White\" had been a mere ranging shot.", "There are a hundred great things about \"Pinocchio\".  Pleasure Island, for one.  I'm amazed how quick the Disney artists were to discover that the multiplane camera, as well as providing accurate perspective and spectacular landscape shots, could be used more subtly to suggest sinister murk.  (We get a similar effect in \"Fantasia\" in the first half of \"The Rite of Spring\".)  And Lampwick's transformation into a donkey is a disturbing moment, for many reasons ... today they might have made the mistake of using flashy computer morphing, which would have been a mistake: expert animation and cutting gives us the distinct impression - almost all done with shadows - that there is a donkey BREAKING THROUGH from inside; which, in his case, is metaphorically accurate.  (Probably the reason Pinocchio survives us that he is as free from native vice as from native virtue.  He must LEARN to adopt the mind-set of Pleasure Island.  This takes time: time enough for him to escape.)But there's much, much more: clever use of songs (note the obvious, but none the less effective, irony of \"I've Got No Strings\"); daring use of stark WHITE backgrounds as well dense crowded ones; an intelligent, mythic story; a wonderful dash of humanity in the form of a cricket; a good musical score; rich atmosphere.  The last is hard to describe.  Of all Disney's films this one has the most pronounced Old World feeling, yet it doesn't seem to take place anywhere in particular - not even in Italy.  Nor does it seem to take place in any particular era.  I fear that no modern film could be so imprecisely evocative; the artistic innocence in which \"Pinocchio\" was forged may be lost forever."], ["Tough To Beat These First Disney Efforts", "When I - and I assume, most people - think of Pinocchio, we think of his nose growing longer when he tells a lie. Yet, that is only one scene in this movie - the first one ever done on this famous fictional character, I believe.This is strictly a fantasy-adventure story, not a parable or a full story about lying, although that obviously is one of the messages. There are several moral messages in here, so it's a worthwhile story for kids to see.Sometimes I think these totally-innocent first few Disney efforts (Bambi, Fantasia) are still better than all the stuff they have put out since.The colorful scenes are another attraction. particularly in the beginning in the old man's house with all the fancy clocks and toys. That part is better than much of the adventure story, as it turns out. The story lags a bit in the middle and then picks up with a rousing finish with a big whale.Overall, I enjoyed \"Jiminy Cricket\" the best and also appreciated that they didn't overdo the songs in here: short and sweet, and not that many. They don't make 'em (normally) like they used to!!"], ["Wonderful", "Last night I watched Pinocchio, Disney's second feature-length film and in my opinion one of the studio's best features. Based on the 19th century book by Carlo Collodi, but not half as unpleasant, Pinocchio combines winning animation with great humor and excitement. There are songs, but they're never like the huge production numbers that last four minutes and feature the voice of some up-and-coming princess of pop (who'll be gone in a year) that the studio later adopted with the applicable exception of When you Wish Upon a Star. My favorite song is \"Little Wooden Head\" which is featured in the beginning and is a truly wonderful scene as Gepetto and Figaro play happily with the new puppet.The movie takes a sadistic, cruel, heartless little wooden boy (Collodi's character) and turns him into an interesting, 3-dimensional kid with a good heart but who is weak-willed and doesn't always listen to reason. The animation makes brilliant use of the multiplane camera, featuring a sprawling opening sequence in which the viewer practically sees the entire village at night. The characters are colorful and fun (I especially love Honest John Foulfellow and his sidekick Gideon) and the story has never a dull moment. This film is a reminder of the sort of efforts Disney put int o their films; the man himself had a great storytelling passion that was lost in later works (Alice in Wonderland, 101 Dalmatians). Pinocchio was never as famous as some of the others, and this is unfortunate because it is his masterpiece."], ["Disney's earliest masterpiece...the art of animation never finer...", "Darker in tone than most Disney animated features (except for 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'), 'Pinocchio' came shortly after 'Snow White' and showed marked improvement in the art of animation technology to produce startling special effects.The first twenty-five minutes alone raise the film to the level of true animation art. Gepetto's inventive clocks come to life as realistically as any real-life photography could do. The warmth and cosiness of his dwelling and the charming shenanigans of Figaro the kitten and Cleo the goldfish, are all perfectly realized. The imaginative use of music and animation art is never finer than in these opening scenes.Afterwards, as the plot thickens, the special effects are just as impressive. The scene of Gepetto searching for Pinocchio with a lantern on a rainy night after he has been captured by Stromboli is unforgettable imagery. The wagon lurching along roads with Pinocchio in a cage is a frightening thing. Even darker are the adventures that await Pinocchio when he reaches Pleasure Island. The scene of the boys turning into donkeys is probably one of the most awesome and frightening moments in the film.Altogether charming are the underwater sequences before the meeting of Monstro the Whale. The climactic chase after the escape from the belly of the whale is handled brilliantly. The music perfectly accents the dramatic chase for this sequence and the songs throughout are in keeping with the mood and characters of the story. It is the sharp contrast between the lighter moments and the darker ones that gives the film a correct blend of fantasy and horror.Parents should be cautioned that very young children may be frightened. Has to be considered one of the most beautifully animated Disney features of all time. A treasure to see again and again."], ["Pinocchio", "This is absolutely, without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. Keep in mind, this movie is only the second feature length animated movie. This is Walt Disney's masterpiece. It's filled with vibrancy and charm. It goes to dark places, and takes so many risks. For me though, every single one of them pay off. Pinocchio is so gullible and charming, and Jiminy Cricket is one of the best mentor characters ever put to film. I love this movie, because I actually care about these characters. They're written in a way that is unbelievably amazing, the script is phenomenal, and the incredible performances, help too. The musical numbers are fun and beautiful. This movie can shift emotions so easily, it goes from heartwarming, to heartbreaking. I remember as a young kid, I really didn't like this movie. It wasn't until I was age thirteen, that I recognized how beautiful this movie was. Everything about this movie is outstanding. If I were to recommend only five films, this would be one of them.

The wooden puppet boy who turns into flesh and blood because of a heroic deed has been done a few times on screen, but the Disney version remains the standard.In some of the animated features of recent years we've come full circle in the fact that a lot of well known Hollywood figures have sought to lend their voices to animated productions. Coming to mind immediately are Mel Gibson as Captain John Smith and Eddie Murphy as the donkey in the Shrek movies. It wasn't as chic a thing to do back in Disney's day, still Walt came up with several good ones like young Dickie Jones as Pinocchio, Walter Catlett as J. Worthington Foulfellow, Frankie Darro as Lampwick, and most important Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket.These folks lend their voices to one of Disney's best musical scores with Catlett making immortal the thespians ballad An Actor's Life For Me, Jones celebrating the fact he's been liberated from all manner of restraint with I've Got No Strings and Cliff Edwards talking about his new responsibilities as the puppet boy's conscience in Give A Little Whistle.Most important though is the Academy Award given to that most plaintive song of yearning When You Wish Upon A Star as introduced by Cliff Edwards. Edwards was a major performer in the Twenties and early Thirties with his ukulele Ike character and introduced many popular songs like It's Only A Paper Moon and Singing In The Rain. But he had come up on hard times with a lot of substance abuse problems when Walt Disney offered him the part of Jiminy Cricket's voice. The movie Pinocchio and the songs he sang there resurrected his career and even when down and out, Edwards could always get work at the Disney Studio because of Jiminy Cricket's enduring popularity.Animation never really dates and the best animation in the world was pioneered at Disney Studio. People can see Pinocchio on the same bill as Shrek even today and I daresay the audience would be equally responsive.And you can appreciate Pinocchio today as much as your grandparents and great grandparents did through the magic of YouTube or Amazon. If not wish upon a star and fate will step in and see you through."], ["Not Just Great Animation -- A Great Movie", "It certainly is interesting reading other viewers comments. I can't imagine anyone being \"bored\" with this film. But then, I don't even go to movies anymore, because I find those made today to be either horrific and traumatizing, or brain-numbingly stoopid and poorly made. Pinocchio, on the other hand, is the ultimate in everything that is \"movie\" : camera-work, special effects, background music, musical numbers, characterization, story development with narrative sweep, high-drama and low-comedy (but never Lockerroom-low), color, motion, editing, use of sound, artwork, audience manipulation... and in the end, life-affirming! I cannot possibly recommend this movie too highly. In my opinion, considering cinematic effectiveness, Pinocchio rates way up with Citizen Kane, Sherlock Jr., and Battleship Potemkin.8 out of 8 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Disney's Dark Masterpiece", "This is the best animated Disney movie I have eve seen, and I have seen most of them. It's so different from all the other ones, as the bad guy not only lives, he also wins. The Coachman is probably one of the most evil villains Disney has ever produced; he turns kids into asses and makes them do hard labor for the rest of their lives...and he gets away with it. Although the ending is happy, there's still bitterness to it because every bad guy gets away, including Stromboli who is evil because of his greed, as with the two foxes who \"befriend\" Pinocchio. Supposedly the book is darker than the movie, but this movie is as dark as it needs to be.The music is memorable, featuring the classic \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" which is the only song that seems to be normal for a Disney movie. It does have other musical numbers, but they all seem to have a dark undertone to them. The animation itself is brilliant, especially for 1941; I've always loved the clock sequence. I only wish that animated movies would get back to drawing animation instead of the new cgi crap; it may take longer, but it looks so much better. It's pretty sad when a movie from 1941 looks better than current ones.This is the only Disney movie I gave a 10/10."], ["Disney's greatest star", "The 2nd animated Disney classic is Disney's finest movie ever. A favorite of mine and a very dear film to me. It is an improvement over \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and more captivating.\"Pinocchio\" is a masterpiece. It is so good that I can't find any faults in. Perfection is notorious in every way: the excellent artwork, palette colors and attention to detail. All of them obey to very high standards. Everything is so well drawn and painted with heart and soul: the sceneries, the characters, the backgrounds, the wonderful details...Although the atmosphere is quite dark and creepy in some parts, most of the time it is a sweet movie that is also great fun, entertaining, heartwarming and magical. Animation and soundtrack are superb as well. I just love all those songs. The movie is also a full plate when it comes to classic humor, thanks to many funny moments and hilarious lines.Being an Italian tale, it takes place in Italy. To be more specific, in a nice village interestingly named Collodi - nothing less than the name of the book's author, Carlo Collodi.This movie also had the honor of being a pioneer in camera use: just notice that nice close-up of a church and how the camera goes straight to the heart of the village.This is a timeless classic. No question about that. In fact, it stands the test of time so well that it's difficult to believe this movie is from the year 1940 because it doesn't look any dated. No, sir! It always looks fresh and modern.Fabulous voice performances is another thing this film doesn't lack. All of them terrific: Dickie Jones, Christian Rub, Cliff Edwards, Charles Judels, Walter Catlett, Evelyn Venable and even some brilliant ones in the art of making sounds like Mel Blanc and Marion Darlington...As for the characters, they're also part of the movie's appeal. Cleo and Figaro are such cute and adorable creatures. Who wouldn't want to have a gold fish and a kitten like that? Geppetto, the kind woodcarver, is so distracted that he's hilarious. Pinocchio is cute, innocent and lovable like a human child, although stubborn and prone to temptation at times. Jiminy Cricket is humorous and cool, but a bit impatient sometimes.Stromboli is hysterical and explosive. His nasty temper makes him so funny, especially whenever he mouths off in Italian! The Blue Fairy has got to be one of the kindest and most beautiful Disney ladies ever. She's so pretty! The coachman looks harmless, but behind his kind looks he's corrupt and a demon.Honest John and Giddy are a perfect comic relief. Giddy is a cat and a funny mute character (like Dopey). Honest John is the epitome of the sly fox: not *really* evil, but clever, hilarious, charming, shameless, unscrupulous and greedy. Ironically, despite his aristocratic manners, he is incapable of hiding a certain rudeness and lack of culture. For example, he can't spell the name \"Pinocchio\" correctly. Honest John's real name is never mentioned in the movie: J. Worthington Foulfellow, likely the strangest name I ever heard.Monstro, the enormous sperm whale, is one of the most impressive animated beasts of all time.This should definitely be on Top 250."], ["The triumph of Disney's Nine Old Men", "Having just re-watched Pinocchio after many years, it's evident that this remarkable feat of animation is the great triumph of Disney's \"Nine Old Men\". These artists were the core of Disney's animation studio for many years, turning out what are now revered as the classics from Disney.What sets Pinocchio apart from every other Disney feature is the sheer depth of care those nine old men (and their assistants) put on the screen. No other Disney feature looks this tremendous, only Snow White comes close. Every, and I mean every, background painting is superb. The medium used for the backgrounds was a water-based paint called gouache. No other animated film looks like this. To think that the entire film was done by hand is amazing, the spectacle of Pleasure Island and the last underwater segment are brilliant compositions by illustrative geniuses. As the darkest fable Disney would bring to the screen, each of the nine old men brought their A game to their characters. Bill Tytla, the studio's \"villain master\" (he was responsible for the unforgettable Chernobog in Fantasia's \"Night on Bald Mountain\" sequence) brings Stromboli to energetic life here. Watch carefully for the table sequence in which Stromboli is eating. He has swallowed part of an onion before berating Pinocchio and shaking the puppet. His breath brings tears to Pinocchio's eyes...this goes by very quickly, but shows the attention to detail crafted in every frame of this terrific film.Many reviews here seem to dwell on the voice acting and the use of \"nobodies\" to speak the lines. One review casually suggests that the actors were simply picked off the street. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even though the actors are uncredited here, the roster of talent was very top-notch for 1940. Comedian Walter Catlett voices the Fox, Catlett was extremely popular at the time and known for his signature round spectacles. The Fox wears these same specs for a brief moment, a nod given to Catlett by the artists. Frankie Darrow was a well known juvenile actor, most famous for his leading role in 1933's \"Wild Boys of the Road\". He voices Lampwick, which is a thinly veiled caricature of the real actor. Dickie Jones, the voice of Pinocchio was another child star who kept a remarkable career alive for many decades. Mel Blanc, the \"man of 1000 voices\" lends his talent to the hiccups of Giddy the Cat, Evelyn Venable is the warm and lovely voice of the Blue Fairy, Clarence Nash, the voice of Donald Duck for years, supplies both Figaro and the donkey brays by the doomed boys of Pleasure Island. Last but not least is Cliff \"Ukelele Ike\" Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket. Edwards will always be known as the man who sang \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" so brilliantly. He owns that song as surely as Judy Garland owns \"Over the Rainbow\". No real voice talent in Pinocchio? Not true. These actors were as famous in their day as the current crop of voices used for animated features. Their work brings the heart to the skill of the animator's art.Still a thrilling experience for fans of the nine old men. In this day of computer technology, it's worth remembering that a computer can't bring the same humanity and love delivered by these great artists."], ["sweet and funny Disney classic", "'Pinocchio' benefits from one of the finest collection of songs to grace a Disney cartoon; from 'I Got No Strings', to 'An Actor's Life For Me', and (best of all) 'When You Wish Upon A Star' - brilliant sung by 'Ukelele Ike' Edwards as Jiminy Cricket.This cute adaptation from Carlo Corolli's classic novel adds pets with the 'aw' factor (cat and fish), as well as a truly scary sequence involving donkeys.  The characters are all memorable and Pinocchio is convincing in his move from a wooden puppet to a real boy, even in cartoon form.  Good voice talent from Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy too, especially in the bits where Pinocchio can't help revealing he isn't telling the truth!Short, sweet, funny, and involving, 'Pinocchio' is worth an hour of anybody's time, young or old.20 out of 24 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["The most enchanting and magical of all the Disney films.", "For seventy years, people of all demographics have been entertained and enchanted by the animated features brought out by the Disney studios. In an era when most animated films lack imagination and spirit, it's always nice to watch an earlier Disney film, whether it be one of their old classics or the works released during the early 90's renaissance. Most film historians claim that Snow White and Fantasia are the best films to come out of the beginning years and while I agree they are certainly historically important, they don't quite give me the joy provided by 1940's Pinocchio. Adapted from the Italian story, Disney may have changed things plenty during the writing progress, but the result is a magical and unforgettable experience that proves to not only be a fun romp, but also one of the best cautionary tales brought to the screen.The story is, of course, familiar to everyone. A kindly, old woodcarver named Gepetto builds his own \"little wooden boy\" and soon enough the puppet is brought to life. However, before he can become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself worthy and with Jiminy Cricket as his conscious, he goes out into the real world, full of crooks and criminals. Naturally, Pinocchio the ever youthful puppet, lands into plenty of trouble, first becoming an actor for a scary marionette master and then being turned into a donkey. The audience, especially the young children watching, are absolutely enthralled by the whole production, but also scared by what is shown on screen. Unlike today's cartoons, that try to be as \"friendly\" as possible, Walt Disney wanted his films to leave an impact and Pinocchio certainly fits into that category. While the film enchants, it also provide plenty of frightening moments as well.Quite possibly the scariest scene in the film is when on Pleasure Island, troublesome boys are transformed into donkeys and sent to the salt-mines. Pinocchio can quite possibly be called the greatest anti-cigar film ever made, just for the fact that it doesn't say that smoking is bad, it shows it (although, ironically, Disney himself was a massive smoker)! Another scene that really gets to young audiences is the part in which Pinocchio begins to lie up a storm and his nose grows, even producing a nest with birds at the end. It's enough to make children squirm in their seats and have them afraid to tell a lie again. One of the reasons these scenes are so successful in leading people to the right decision is the fact that Pinocchio is not just a little wooden boy, he represents the child in every one of us: naive and ready to set out into the world, but not fully aware of the dangers awaiting us.Along with the donkey-transformation and nose-growing scenes, the most memorable aspect of Pinocchio is the music. \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" is Disney's anthem for a reason. It's not only beautiful, but also brings about what we all want: to wish for a better world, one without evil puppet masters, children taking bad habits and devilish foxes bringing people to the dark side. Finally, the most touching scene comes in the end, when Pinocchio seems like he might die, but his bravery to save Gepetto finally allows him to become a real boy. Even remembering that scene leads one to smile as it's not only Gepetto and Pinocchio's wish that is fulfilled, but ours as well. Everybody loves a happy ending and Pinocchio features the best of them all. Not only is it the best film made by Disney, but it's also their most optimistic. And that's why Pinocchio is such a classic."], ["After some thinking I'm going to call it. \"Pinocchio\" is the best animated film of all time.", "This movie is just impossible not to love.

After all the time choosing I pick this. Why? Well honestly I have to say the characters in this movie are as likable as movie characters can get. Also it has a lot of good bad guys. My personal favorite is the Honest John and Gideon. I consider them to be the most underrated Disney villains ever. Honest John is a slimy jerk who wants to trick Pinocchio. Gideon is his sidekick who is a brainless idiot. Both of them together create a great villain team. Then I have to mention \"When You Wish Upon a Star\". I think we all know that it is a masterpiece. Disney sure knows it because they put their logo to that song at the beginning of their movies. Then you have the most revolutionizing animation in film history. \"Snow White\" was a revolutionary film, but it was simply baby steps into animated filmmaking.

A Genuine Epoch In Animation Art And Cinema In General.", "Disney's 'Pinocchio', in my humble opinion,is Disney greatest achievement. i've studied Disney's life and legacy since childhood and i think my opinion counts for something. it's not like i don't know Disney films or have just a passing relationship with them. i've been a serious fan all my life.actually, 'Dumbo' is my personal favorite from Disney. but personal taste, and opinion based on some education and knowledge, are really two different measures of evaluation. personal taste is often clouded by, well, personal opinion and taste. opinions based on knowledge and education are often less biased and more objective. when speaking from personal feelings,'Dumbo' is the Disney film i truly love the most, but when i evaluate objectively, i realize it's 'Pinocchio' that is Disney's greatest work of cinema.when i was younger this definitely wasn't my favorite. as a matter of fact, my mother recalled that when i was very young, about four or five, my father had to take me out of the movie theater during 'Pinocchio' screaming my head off in terror. i've also talked with other people who said they were Disney fans, and they either had similar disturbances watching this film when younger or they were kind of negative about the film. when i saw it years later on a reissue when i was about nine, i remember finding it interesting, but thought it to be a little weird and kinda creepy. i remember liking things like 'Mary Poppins' or 'Robin Hood' or 'The Aristocats' better, and feeling more comfortable with those kind of Disney films. 'Pinocchio' seemed like a lot of art deco weirdness from decades long ago. it wasn't until i was much older and had read a few books about Disney that i started to have a intellectual appreciation for the classic films. i suddenly found myself rethinking 'Pinocchio' and when i saw it again on a reissue when in my twenties, i was blown away by it and was convinced it was one of the very best films i'd ever seen period. in fact 'Pinocchio' is one of my top five favorites of all time.as i've got older i've also developed more of a taste for classic children's literature and nursery rhymes and fairy tales. they amuse and are whimsical. i actually read Collodi's 'Pinocchio' again for the first time since third grade only a few years ago. can't say i actually liked it except as a curiosity. i greatly admire Lewis Carroll and James Barrie as well as Frank Baum and other children's book writers. can't say i feel that way about Collodi. he was kind of weird and didn't always show a lot of good humour. plus 'Pinocchio' is not a very cute book or character. the drawings in the Disney cartoon are a lot more appealing and cuter. i've never been big on too much moralizing either. doesn't appeal to me. that whole \"a little boy that won't be good thing...\" just plain scares me and annoys me to all hell. for one thing i find being good to tall a order and not of much appeal to me since i am by nature, naturally rebellious. Collodi can sit on his book for all i care, the Disney cartoon simply has some rad looking animation unlike anything seen before or since. it's a little more intense than the usual Disney offerings, even at this time, that's why i dig it.i don't like a lot of petty, judgmental moralizing, just ain't my thing. i also don't wish on stars, believe in guardian angels or sentimentalize too much about childhood or family. but i do think a lot of Disney's 'Pinocchio' is funny, hilarious stuff. if you also like outrageous mind blowing weirdness in your animation soup, this is your mix. this is pretty eccentric and peculiar fixings that still give me creepies and disturb my nightmares as much as any horror show. i love it. and there is even a happy ending, some cute Disney songs and cuddly furry widdle kitty."], ["Important things that we living for a human", "Pinocchio is my favorite movie since I was a child.

This is best highlighted throughout the film when events and themes of real life situations such as having to go to school and having to carve a trade (in the toy making business, in this case) are counter balanced with walking, talking foxes and magical fairies coming down from the sky. The best thing about the film is that it manages to set the film in an ordinary and everyday village located within the Alps mountain range and yet incorporates these elements of the bizarre and of the unnatural seamlessly.The scene that best highlights this is when Pinocchio himself is running to school and Hounest John (Catlett) notices the wooden puppet in question doing exactly that. He stops, thinking it very odd and intervenes. And yet I suppose nobody is supposed to batter an eyelid if they themselves saw a fox walking down the street with a top hat and cigar. So if the film could be about dreams in the sense Pinocchio's father Geppetto (Rub) wants a son and Pinocchio himself (Jones) wants to be a 'real boy' then the film certainly recognises this and compliments the theme with a number of bizarre and surreal scenes that even today, very much work on a level of recognition and respect but also surrealism.The creepiest thing the film has going for it throughout is the manner in which it gives animals such as Figaro the cat, Cleo the goldfish and Monstro the whale such humane characteristics. Figaro is able to understand Geppetto's English and display certain reactions but is not able to reply; Cleo is able to become aware of what's going on around her despite being inside a bowl and is able to display all the necessary human emotions of panic, fear and is able to blush when necessary situations arise. Monstro the whale is a beast displaying copious amounts of greed and sloth in the sense he sleeps and eats whenever one of the instincts takes over and is able to identify the a certain character's boat before unleashing a wrath of anger.This idea is actually toyed with by the film later on in one of the more bizarre sequences during which human beings turn into animals, those being donkeys, and it's this scene that stays with most people. This is most probably because the boundaries between animal with human instincts and human with human instincts (albeit the want to smoke and drink) are blurred resulting in human characters becoming animals and submitting to the lowly 'braying' noise donkeys make as they sit in their cages, beaten and consequently submissive. What's quite interesting here is Pinocchio's overall characteristic in the sense he is wooden and thus; being a 'real' boy or a 'real' human as it were further brings attention to the film's study of the escapist-come-realist universe.As a study of character, Pinocchio's is the most emphasised. As a character, he is new to the world and na\u00efve as a consequence; failing to spot evil and wrong-doers no matter how obvious. He even has the manners to shout 'goodbye' to one of his oppressors, thus risking re-capture. If the film is about things and animals that 'come alive' and perform beyond their capabilities, it is fitting the protagonist's quest should revolve around becoming something he is not and this acts as a further example of transgression. If we analyse most of the other boys at the doomed fair ground and look at their transgression into another being, it can be read into quite obviously that cigars, beer and hustling take you one way: the salt-mines or the circus (as printed on the donkey's cages) but resisting the urge and listening to a conscience or generally not taking to the temptation will lead you to be a 'real' boy, then onto a 'real' man since after boyhood comes manhood.This is Disney's morality tale and it's the sort of material that is always going to be bleak no matter who takes it on, cartoon or no cartoon. But Disney's attention to animation is also key, having their antagonists come across as large, booming men in Stromboli and the Coach Driver (both Judels) and having Hounest John a fox; an animal most animated films since would have you think the sliest and slimiest animal of them all; this film may well have broken that particular mould. I also liked the manner in which the antagonistic figures smoked their cigars, creating shapes and bizarre circles with their smoke whereas Pinocchio himself on the other hand can barely smoke it right and consequently goes green, the beginning of a short stint whilst under the influence of Marijuana, given that the Marijuana symbol is in his mouth following a botched pool shot.In terms of aging, the film is faultless on the animation side. The painstakingly slow process of each frame can only be marvelled at and with computers doing more of the films nowadays, the marvelling will definitely continue. I don't like the character accents and the issues I have with type casting involve Stromboli being an unnecessarily oddball Italian and his show comprising of all the clich\u00e9s you'd expect with Russians, French and Dutch puppets complete with stereotypical imagery. But the film remains powerful and eerie at other times, even if it is down to the oddball mesh of a universe it is set. This is no doubt an impressive film."], ["The Allegory of its own Miraculous Creation ...", "\"Pinocchio\" is probably the only Disney film where the magic operates almost instantly, using its most representative score for the opening credits. As soon as we hear these magic lyrics of the Oscar-winning \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", we know we're embarked in a whole new dimension, a unique world that only the perseverance and creativity of Disney animators could have lead us to. It became Disney's most defining music, embodying all the values that Disney films stood for: believing in dreams, believing in the ability to 'give life' to drawn characters. The making of the film plays like a poetic allegory, Disney studios ' animators are all little Gepetto's with the same craftsmanship and dedication to their work, and the blue Fairy tale is Walt Disney giving them lives and dreams, something enabling us to identify with them. \"I Dream, therefore I Am\" sounds like Disney's cogito.We instantly identify with \"Pinocchio\" for his dreams to be a real boy, to be a reason for his gentle father's pride. Yet the movie doesn't deal with this existentialist issue, the core of the action in \"Pinocchio\" \u2013which on this level, remains one of the most thrilling animated adventures- is the temptation. Tasting jam, stealing, not going to school, lying, childhood is the most exposed moments to temptations, everything is new then everything looks pretty, and when the standard for kids is to obey to authoritarian figures who know the best for them, the most precious lesson in \"Pinocchio\" is not to obey for the sake of obedience but to follow his conscience, to differentiate between right or wrong. That's what being a real boy is about, being unselfish, trustful and brave, not being obedient. And that, my friends, is quite thought-provoking in the way it recognizes a right for children to exercise their free will, but not without a vital element.On that level, the character of Jiminy Cricket is a great invention because he embodies the necessity of a conscience, while most of the time; we can see Pinocchio making his own decisions without questioning Jiminy. Temptation is the ugly cousin of unconsciousness and remains a predominant figure in the movie, always incarnated by adult figures. This aspect conveys the perfect feeling of childhood, a period of our life when we're small and therefore most likely to follow the bigger ones, any adult is a potential parent, and while our parents are the ones who say 'no' or 'don't'. As kids, we're most eager to follow those who say 'yes' and 'do'. Foulfellow and Gideon, the fox and the mute cat are the intermediaries between Pinocchio and the two main villains of the film so even if the duo was meant to be a comic relief, I always found them scary in the way they tried to ruin Pinocchio's life twice.Naturally, as a film conveying a perfect lesson about life, trust, and temptation, it features two villains that had probably inspired many nightmares. From Stromboli and his scary lips, as the ruthless puppeteer who wants to make fortune with the only puppet without strings or the Coachman, the films echoes children's most inner fears: being exploited, tortured and abused by ruthless adults. The image of Stromboli throwing Pinocchio in his cage or the close-up on the Coachman's devilish face, prove that \"Pinocchio\" is darker and more daring than it seems. And to those who associate Disney with cute little animals and singing flowers, I invite them to watch carefully the Pleasure Island sequence, and to see the cute Pinocchio smoking a cigar and drinking a beer with his buddy Lampwick. This sequence alone highlights the dangers of exercising free will without questioning good old conscience.And what follows is another demonstration of Disney's cinematic talent, when we see what happen to the poor boys that made 'jackasses' of themselves. The heart-breaking part when a little Alexander cries for his mommy is scary enough, but kids had to face the metamorphosis of Pinocchio's buddy, his face changing, and the voice of his \"Mommmma\" turning into hysterical braying and desperate glass breaking to measure the danger of making a fool of yourself. This scene alone is one of the most horrific of cinema's history and works as a magnificent symbolism, mirroring the calmer and most poetic moment when Pinocchio's lie makes his nose grow \"until it's as plain as a nose in your face\". Disney has a unique talent to speak through simple images universal statements about childhood and coming of age, and I wonder how many kids thought twice before lying or acting 'jackasses'.The second intervention of the blue Fairy tale informs Pinocchio that his father is in the belly of Monstro, the whale, which leads to the climactic confrontation with the only villain of the film that would be defeated. The part where he swims to Monstro with Jiminy is magnificent and the escape is totally gripping thanks to the patient build-up that made us figure Monstro's reputation and the film's unique use of special effects. The whole film is a masterpiece of innovation and technical accomplishment, with so many zooms and close-up, dominating space and screen like only Disney could have done, the action sequences, the panoramic views on the village the animation of the Fairy tale, were so impressive that I can't count how many times I wondered what the film would have been like in the movie theater.But how many animated films now would show a kid drinking or smoking, turning into a donkey and not even being saved, \"Pinocchio\" is a film that dares to portray kids the way they sometimes do for the sake of intelligence, while 70 years later, for the sake of political correctness, kids have to endure sappy and moralizing educative cartoons. If only for a film like \"Pinocchio\", Walt Disney is the greatest entertainer who ever lived, because one of the few that truly understood what being children meant."], ["A Very Memorable Childhood Film", "A very wonderful film - one I remembered from my childhood (but then again so are most of the classic Disney films).

So the film is good for young kids.This movie also contains another one of Walt Disney's most memorable songs: When You Wish Upon A Star sung by Cliff Edwards.If you like Disney movies like \"Peter Pan\" or \"Peter and the Wolf\" then you might like Pinocchio.8.5/104 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Pinocchio", "This is one of the greatest and one of my favourite Disney films ever made. Pinocchio is a magical and sometimes emotional story about the wooden puppet brought to life by the fairy. Geppetto wishes on a star that his marionette could be a real boy, and the fairy grants his wish. To become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish. Unfortunately, many things happen to him to stop him from achieving this. For example, two villains make Pinocchio famous by appearing in Stromboli's puppet show, and also he goes to a theme park where there are consequences waiting, like turning yourself into a donkey, and also there is the terrifying giant whale, Monstro, to face, but don't worry, there is the magical happy ending where Geppetto and Pinocchio get their wish come true. Of course, this film would not be complete without the giggles of Jiminy Cricket and the wonderful music, especially the Oscar winning song \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" which was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Leigh Harline, Paul J. Smith and Ned Washington. It was number 83 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"], ["Pinocchio", "I'm actually not sure if I ever saw \"Pinocchio\" before now, but eh. This film took me by surprise, not because I thought it was going to be bad, but at how good it actually was. Based (although from what I've heard without much of the hardcore stuff) on Carlo Collidi's novel of the same name, \"Pinocchio\" tells the story of the titular puppet who longs to become a real boy. When his creator, and Italian toy-maker named Gepetto, wishes for the marionette to come to life, the Blue Fairy makes his wish come true. Not only that, if Pinocchio can prove himself good, honest and unselfish, he will become a REAL boy. With the help of his conscience, Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio will learn how easy it is to be led off the beaten path, and how important it is to put yourself before others, to be honest and to always let conscience be your guide.The animation is stunning, with the shading exquisite, especially on the fur of Tuxedo cat, Figaro, and the wily fox, Honest John. The white finish makes to give the fur a distinct, fluffy look. The animation of the water is amazing, with luscious brushstrokes imitating the tide - hell, even the tide is animated well! The backgrounds are once again lovely, with these amazing panning shots that make it seem like it was filmed by an actual camera. The little details are wonderful, such as the flickering flames, the bubbles and the fish's transparent tail. It's a true work of art.The characters are plenty of fun too. Jiminy isn't half as annoying as I thought he'd be, in fact I found him charming. Pinocchio is that everyman kid, who soaks things in and comes out on top, but still isn't perfect. Not only is he a very good character due to this, but he acts like, well, a real kid! Kids do act selfish, tell lies and go against authority, but sometimes, especially when very young, they may not even know what they're doing is wrong. Pinocchio is a great example of this, and Jiminy walking away, getting lost and so forth shows the swaying of the conscience. It's very clever. Minor characters are shown for just the right amount of time, showcasing their charisma, likability and sometimes fear. The villains are great; all are malicious on different levels, but the one that shocked me most was the Coach Master, who runs Paradise Island. Call me an overthinker (which I am), but I got this child predator vibe off him; inviting kids to have fun, then stripping them down to a primal level ... ugh he was just creepy. Well, whatever the deeper implications may or may not be, the obvious intent is there, and is clever too. I guess it can be read in many different ways.Gepetto was a likable fellow, but who really stood out to me was Figaro, the cat. Let's just say I understand why Disney wanted him to be in the film as much as possible, he's just adorable, and his expressions are great! Overall, \"Pinocchio\" is a wonderful film , with stunning artwork and numerous important messages for children, and even adults."], ["One of the Studio's Greatest", "Pinocchio (1940)**** (out of 4)Disney's second feature tells the classic story of an elderly toy maker who makes a wooden puppet he calls Pinocchio. Before bed the old man wishes that he had a real boy and for that the fairy godmother brings the wooden doll to life but before he can become a real boy he must prove himself to be good.It's funny to think that upon its original release PINOCCHIO really didn't do that well at the box office and it ended up really hurting the studio. Of course when the film is discussed today it is considered one of the studio's best and most loved films and there's no question that there's really nothing like it. The story has been told countless times by a variety of people but nothing has come close to the magic of this movie.I use the term magic because when you get older and view this movie you can't help but be rather amazed at what all it contains. Of course there's the sweet side of the older man wanting a boy of his own and then there's the side of a puppet wanting to become a real boy. Both of these characters are great as is the Jiminy Cricket character who adds some nice laughs. Not only do you have the cute and charming side but there's also a very dark side to the film.It's funny but many people call this one of the scariest movies they've ever seen and you can read stories about how this movie traumatized young children. The scenes at Pleasure Island where kids are stolen from their families and turned into donkeys is just so dark yet at the same time you can't help but appreciate the message. Finally, there's the action inside the whale, which just adds to a great little sequence full of adventure and fun.Throw in the \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" song and you've really got one of the most complete Disney movies out there. As you'd expect, the animation from these original Disney features is wonderful and I really loved the terrific detail. Of course animation improved over the years but there's still something special and unique to these original Disney movies. PINOCCHIO is clearly one of the studio's best."], ["The second Disney animated feature film and probably the best one to date", "This is a Walt Disney Animation Studios production. There will be spoilers ahead:Pinocchio is the second animated feature done by Disney, following the very successful feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It can be argued that Pinocchio is the best animated feature Disney has made thus far. The animation is excellent, the film is visually beautiful and it has one of the most fantastic dramatic sequences done in an animated film (the climactic Monstro scenes). The characters are fully realized for the most part and the story and plotting are strong.The film is framed by Jiminy Cricket and opens with the song \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", sung by Jiminy. He then tells the story of a wish coming true. Jiminy is an interesting character, given that he becomes the \"conscience\" of a wooden boy even though he starts out as a down on his heels vagabond in tattered clothes who sneaks into a shop to get warm. Jiminy is actually something of a rogue and a ladies' man. He's also not particularly good at the \"conscience\" job much of the time.The story revolves around Pinocchio, a wooden marionette made by Geppetto, a woodcarver who wishes upon a star that Pinocchio become a real boy. The Blue Fairy hears this wish and makes it come partially true, bringing Pinocchio to life as a wooden boy. In order to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself, brave, unselfish and honest. The first part of the film sets the characters up, including a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo (a few short films with Figaro and Cleo were also made).Pinocchio winds up sent off to school by himself and runs into Honest John, the principal villain, and his sidekick, Gideon, who shanghai Pinocchio by selling him to Stromboli, a puppeteer who puts Pinocchio in his show and then in a cage to hold him against his will. Pinocchio is rescued ineptly by Jiminy and then effectively by the Blue Fairy. Pinocchio becomes frightened and lies to the Blue Fairy. She helps him anyway, warning him that it would be the last time.Rescued once, Pinocchio again falls prey to Honest John again and is sold again, sent to Pleasure Island with other boys, said boys ultimately turning into donkeys. Jiminy helps Pinocchio, now with donkey ears and a tail, to escape and make his way back home, to find Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo gone to search for him. The three have been swallowed by Monstro, a giant whale. Pinocchio heads out to save them, seeking out Monstro with Jiminy's help.This part of the film is beautiful, the fish detailed magnificently. Pinocchio finds Monstro and Geppetto and crew. He figures out a way for them to escape and manages to be brave, truthful and unselfish by rescuing Geppetto at the risk of himself. There is a happy ending to the story.This film has been available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth getting. Most highly recommended."], ["What artistry!", "While I would not place \"Pinocchio\" among the very best feature- length films by Disney, it's sure close. The only reason I don't score this one a 10 is that around the same time, the Disney Studio made a few better films during this era--particularly \"Bambi\".So why am I so high on this film? Well, it's truly an artistic triumph. The backgrounds are gorgeous--with lots of detail that show that this was a labor of love. And, the animation of the characters is about as good as you can find. Together, they show that the studio had learned and progressed quite a bit since their first feature, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". And, the film also is possibly the best looking Disney film. But the story itself is the weakest part of the film. It's good but not great. Some of this is due to difficult to like characters (Pinocchio himself is an idiot when you think about it and Jimminy Cricket is a lousy conscience and does nothing to keep the puppet out of trouble) and a story that just doesn't reach your heart the way some of their other films would do. Exceptional nonetheless.7 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Unquestionably the king of Disney's full-length animated movies", "I can assure, very confidently, that this version of 'Pinocchio' is the best Disney full-length animated movie ever. Nothing compares to it. Even in my childhood 'Pinocchio' was already one of my favorite Disney animated movies, if not my favorite. So many years later and time hasn't done anything to harm its magic and charm.Nowadays I don't call just any Disney animated film a masterpiece anymore, so I'm very selective on that matter. But 'Pinocchio' deserves to be called something that honorable.What is it that makes 'Pinocchio' so special? It is based on a Carlo Collodi's tale which isn't even all that great! I think the secret is that they made marvels with this movie. The movie is wonderful, magical, charming and a timeless classic. It is one of those movies made with heart, soul and exceptional talent. I'd go as far as telling they made it in a unique moment of inspiration.There are films that age quickly or were already born obsolete. Others take time to age. But this one never seems to age, which is amazing for something that is now 70 years old! How can that be? Well, it is so advanced for its time that it still looks fresh even for today's standards. I wouldn't guess this is so old if I didn't know already.This is a very complete movie. The artwork is perfect and colorful, everything is carefully drawn and painted. The film is a clever combination of some of the funniest moments in cinema history and some of the darkest and most sinister ever. Animation is terrific. The soundtrack is excellent, with lots of musical pieces to enjoy.This is an Italian tale, so it takes place in Italy, which is great, for it benefits from a certain Italian touch of film-making and Italian charm.The characters are another strength. Geppetto is like a funnier version of Doc from 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. Figaro and Cleo are sweet pets. Pinocchio is far more innocent and much nicer and likable than in the book, being also a cute puppet unlike that of the book. Jiminy Cricket is a cool chap and amusing but at times he seems to have some anger issues and apparent short temper. Stromboli is hilarious and one of the most surly guys I've ever known in a movie. You wouldn't want to be around him when he gets mad! Still, I like Stromboli.I also like Honest John and Gideon. Both are hilarious. Gideon is like a wilder version of Dopey from 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. I wonder if the \"myth\" of the foxes being clever, sly and unreliable started with Honest John. Don't let his name fool you, he is only honest by name. Well, it's not even his real name! As for Monstro the whale, I've never seen quite anything like that before or after. It still impresses in appearance, size, presence, scariness and noise!Title in Portugal: 'Pin\u00f3quio'."], ["Very touching and sweet", "Pinocchio is probably one of the more sentimental Disney films. I wouldn't say that it's my absolute favourite (that award goes to Bambi), but it is certainly a classic film that all ages can enjoy.The film takes a lot of liberties from the original story, but maybe it's for the best. In the book, Pinocchio is a sarcastic and heartless character, and that simply would not work in a Disney film. Even though he's a wooden puppet, like Bambi, he has been modelled to have the features and personality of a young child. Pinocchio is innocent, na\u00efve and sometimes selfish, but he's also playful and often downright adorable.The film has its dark moments, the most notable being what happens on Pleasure Island, and the fate that befalls poor Lampwick. I feel that, as surreal as it is, it conveys a very poignant message - 'The Devil makes work for idle hands.' I've seen some fans clamour for Disney to make a sequel where all the boys are rescued from that dreadful place. As nice as it sounds, I feel that it would take away the whole meaning of the film. Pinocchio is dark, but it's never bleak or depressing. It's very funny too, most of the humour coming from the lovable Jiminy Cricket and Gepetto.The backgrounds are lovely. The village and countryside are typical of rural Italy, but that's not all. The underwater scenes are incredible - remember, this is the first time characters were animated underwater. Although I wonder how Pinocchio managed to breathe?I'm not so keen on the music. 'When you Wish Upon a Star' isn't my favourite Disney song, but it's still quite good. It sure beats any of the Phil Collins music that's piped in over Tarzan soaring through a plastic jungle.As beautiful as it is, Pinocchio does have a some minor flaws. I felt that the goldfish character was completely unnecessary, cute as it was. Also, I felt that the story was a little 'Americanized.' But I've seen worse - take a look at Aladdin. Who's going to think that real Arabs are like that? Not me, that's for sure. Don't let it bother you.I like Pinocchio a lot more than I have before. It's warm, touching, funny, atmospheric and is somewhat a cautionary tale. It's so much more than 'a cute movie about a puppet.'"], ["A delightful animated morality tale", "This Disney classic tells the story of Pinocchio a marionette made by Geppetto. Having finished making the doll Geppetto settles down to sleep and wishes that Pinocchio could be a real boy. As he sleeps a fairy grants his wish. As Pinocchio wakes the fairy tells him that while he is alive he is not yet a real boy; to do that he must prove himself \"brave, truthful, and unselfish\". To help him Jiminy Cricket, the cricket who is also the story's narrator, is appointed his conscience. Not surprisingly Geppetto is rather surprised but he is also happy. The next day he sends Pinocchio to school but along the way he meets two dubious characters who persuade him forget about going to school and instead join a puppet show where he is to be the star attraction. Inevitably it does not end well but Jiminy and the fairy rescue him. One would think that Pinocchio would learn his lesson but soon he is being tempted again; this time to somewhere even more dangerous. Once again he is rescued by Jiminy and they head home once more; when they get there they learn Geppetto has gone looking for him and got in trouble\u0085 it is now time for Pinocchio to be \"brave, truthful, and unselfish\".I believe this was the first film I ever saw in the cinema; and I hadn't seen it since then. For that reason alone I had to watch it when it was on television. I'm over forty years older now but still found the film delightful. The story is obviously a morality tale as Pinocchio it tempted but ultimately proves himself; this isn't done in a heavy-handed way at the expense of viewers' enjoyment. There are plenty of child-friendly scares and some genuinely dark moments\u0085 the bad children aren't saved from their fate of being turned to donkeys and force to work in the salt mines! The animation is absolutely stunning; it is amazing to think that this was made in an era when animation was entirely hand drawn with; the use of shadows and the scenes involving the whale and the foaming sea were particularly spectacular.

The best Animated feature of All Time", "I suppose an argument could be made for \"Fantasia\" as well, but certain sequences shine better than others, and it has that boring narrator. Pinocchio makes the best use of the revolutionary multi-plane camera and almost has a 3D quality about it. The most important and dramatic parts are animated with exquisite and exacting detail. The water and fire sequences are hypnotically lifelike and realistic. As he did in other (early) cartoon features, other connecting parts of it are drawn with a \"broader\" stroke and, while very well drawn, have a bit less detail and treatment, to carry the story along. Much precise and amazing rotoscopic action. Magnificent backgrounds and truly scary moments. Re-released to theaters circa 1955, I was only 5-years-old. The songs and \"voice-overs\" (mostly uncredited) have never been equaled. The talents of Mel Blanc and Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket. They tell me that The Blue Fairy was drawn to resemble Jean Harlow. An unforgettable musical score and numbers such as \"I Got No Strings\" and Oscar-winning song \"When you wish upon a star\". As a 5-year-old I still remember being awe-stuck and truly scared when cigar-smoking Lampwick turns into a donkey on Pleasure Island and everyone is swallowed by Monstro The Whale.

The one that followed up the inaugural Snow White was none other than Pinocchio, the famous story about a wooden Italian boy who was created by the woodcarver Gepetto and brought to live by the blue fairy. Pinocchio proved to be less successful at the box office than its processor was. This can probably be linked to the outbreak of World War II, which prevented the film of becoming a success in Europe. Even though Pinocchio wasn't a major hit financial wise, it proved to be the embodiment of animated perfection.The story is based on the book 'The adventures of Pinocchio' by Carlo Collodi. The book is really dark and even sadistic, so it seems obvious that Walt's team didn't literally follow the book, because that wouldn't have struck a right chord with the audiences. In the film, Gepetto (voiced by Christian Rub) is a joyful old woodcarver, who lives with his cat, Figaro and his fish, Cleo. He carved a little boy out of wood and that is, of course, Pinocchio (voiced by Dickie Jones). One night, after Gepetto wished upon a star, the blue fairy appears and brings Pinocchio to live. She appoints a Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards) as his conscience. If Pinocchio stays brave, truthful and unselfish, he'll one day become a real boy. Together, Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket encounter all sorts of adventures. They meet Honest John (Voiced by Walter Catlett), a sly fox who wants some money, so he brings the naive Pinocchio to the puppet maker Stromboli, who imprisons Pinocchio because he makes him rich due to his success as a puppet without strings. He escapes, but Honest John sends him off to Pleasure Island. The kids can do all the rebellious things they want to do there. Pinocchio meets Lampwick, a rebellious boy who loves to do naughty things. Jiminy discovers that the boys are turned into donkeys who are being sold to salt mines to work as slaves. He tries to convince Pinocchio and Lampwick, but the latter already turns into a donkey. Pinocchio escapes the island in time and only has a tail and a pair of long ears. Meanwhile, they find out that Gepetto and his pets have been swallowed by a whale. Pinocchio and Jiminy attempt to save them and what follows is an exciting finale where they try to escape from the furious whale. Pinocchio dies. However, the blue fairy brings him back to life and the entire family rejoice.Pinocchio has been described by many critics as the most perfect Disney classic of all time. It's hard to argue. It isn't my favorite, but you can't deny the marvelous animation. There are just so many fabulous details. Not only in the drawing of the main characters, but also in the backgrounds. Everything has been given thought. The story is very exciting as well. Pinocchio is likable as a character who has a hard time separating right from wrong and Gepetto is a nice old man, who just comes off as very likable. The side characters are fun as well. The villains are designed perfectly. My favorite moment of the film is the scene where they escape from the whale. That scene is just pure brilliance. It's exciting all the way through and the design of the underwater world and especially the whale is mesmerizing. The ending is joyful and fits perfectly within the film. A timeless classic that can be enjoyed by the entire family."], ["Cleverer than heck! Astounding craftsmanship and storytelling", "Disney turned the original Pinocchio story into a colorful metaphor for the evolution of the soul.To me, the most jawdropping aspect of the work is the non-stop barrage of sheer craftsmanship. From the visuals, to the audio, to the voice work, to the songwriting... and on and on and on...And, after all that has been taken into account, we're left with an expansive, ambitious picaresque adventure that seems to modulate the main character through paces toward full personhood. It's a fun, non-preachy extended sermon on getting in tune with your higher self and getting on the road to heaven. Sure, Jimminy mounts the Jack-in-the-Pulpit to pontificate... but that's the point: He looks silly. In the end, Pinocchio takes his lumps, pays his dues, and grows up.Wot a story! Wot a production!

It couldn't be done. And why should it be anyway, nobody is going to want to watch a 90-minute cartoon. After proving those commonly held thoughts to be oh so wrong with the triumph of Snow White what would Walt Disney do for an encore? Pinocchio came next and showed Disney was not going to rest on his laurels. For as magnificent an achievement as Snow White was the animation on display in that film could be said to be a little crude compared to what was to come. Pinocchio advanced the art form. Visually there is nothing to quibble with here, everything looks fantastic. And what great action too, imagination is not limited to what the animators might be able to achieve. It seems they could achieve whatever they wanted. There are some big, bold sequences in this film that show the great jump the Disney team had made in just three years since Snow White. Disney had succeeded in making the impossible possible.Everyone is familiar by now with the famous story of Pinocchio, that of the wooden puppet magically brought to life. But while he can walk and talk and sing and dance he is still made of wood and wishes to be a real boy. His quest to become real will take him to some very interesting places. Some very bizarre places too. If you're going to accept the basic premise of a wooden puppet brought to life I guess you can accept pretty much anything. But there is the sense that maybe the story ultimately gets a little too weird for the film's good. The second half of the film is not as much fun as the first. It even gets a little scary, poor Pinocchio in almost constant peril. Luckily our puppet hero has some helpers. There's Jiminy Cricket who serves as his conscience, trying to help the incredibly naive Pinocchio know right from wrong. Whenever Pinocchio's really stuck you can count on the Blue Fairy to show up and help out. And of course there is kindly, old Geppetto, Pinocchio's maker, his \"father\" so to speak who has his own strange misadventure.The story lags somewhat in the middle and does take those truly bizarre turns toward the end. But as a whole the story is satisfying, sure to leave a smile on your face. It's so easy to love Pinocchio, the character, that you are willing to overlook any minor quibbles with Pinocchio, the film. And the main character is not the only thing to love. Jiminy is a lot of fun, Geppetto is one of the most kindhearted characters you'll see in any film. And as much as you like the good guys the film gives you some stellar bad guys to hiss at too. The score is terrific. There is the iconic When You Wish upon a Star to open the film and some other good songs sprinkled in along the way. The film provides laughs, charm, suspense, drama, pretty much everything you could ask for. And it looks absolutely magnificent, taking animation to new heights.

Its themes and story are truly universal. Indeed, the Disney version of Pinocchio was a film integral to my early memories of childhood and perhaps those of millions of other children (and adults) at heart. But aside from sentimental emotional attachments, Pinocchio is a fine work of art. Technically superb, with an engaging storyline, Pinocchio is truly is a timeless classic and a beautiful film...Few people in the Western world are not familiar with Pinocchio: the mischievous wooden puppet who redeems himself from his not-so-angelic ways, and is finally rewarded for it. Most children are more familiar with the watered down (and some say corrupted) Disney version than the original by Carlos Collodi. I recommend that all children should also read the original book, as it perhaps explores more 'adult' themes, not subjugated into the naivety of the child-world of the Disney Pinocchio. Yet the latter is not as rosy as many Disney offerings - indeed there are some frightening scenes which could be hardly suitable for small children. The scene where the Coachman 'transforms' into his inner sentinel is genuinely disconcerting.Pinocchio was Disney's second offering, after the highly successful and ground-breaking 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' of 1937. Indeed, Disney created an entirely new type of film. The animated feature: the world's and characters of these animated worlds were as 'real' to the audience as any real film. Indeed, the fact that the characters in these films do not exist in real life make the characters all the more convincing. In a sense, the characters inhabit the film as a figure in a painting.The film is a visual delight. The sophistication of animation at the time was almost unheard of, and extremely sophisticated. The scene were the clocks tick in unison was particularly difficult, as was the Monstro scene. Colours and textures are vibrant and lifelike, while the characters are modeled beautifully. Indeed, for pure animated wizardly Pinocchio rivals many present day cartoons.The direction of the film, sound effects and voicing were very good. Dickie Jones, as a young Pinocchio is well-cast. Direction and 'shooting' was far ahead of many films of the time; the early scene where the 'camera' pans across the rooftops of the village reputedly cost over $20,000.Yet the visual and aural aspects are only there to bring the story to life, and this film, as much as any other, displays the strength of good storytelling. While highly moralistic, the film opens with Jimminy Cricket: an endearing, street-smart wanderer who is perhaps more memorable as Pinocchio himself. Geppeto is the kind puppet maker who carves Pinocchio out of wood, who is subsequently granted his wish when Pinocchio is made a real boy. Obviously, Pinocchio does not go to school and this leads him into all sorts of trouble. After escapades in the theatre, Treasure Island and the bottom of the sea he is redeemed by risking his life to save his father.Pinocchio is perhaps the most remarkably 'flat' and lifeless character. He is a 'cipher' without any distinct personality traits. On the other hand, the characters which inhabit this fantasy world (supposed to be set in Italy) are the most memorable of any animated feature. There's Honest John, the wise-talking conman (or con-fox), Lampwick and of course the three villains or 'baddies.' Stromboli is a hot-tempered showmaster: bloated and greedy, he is the epitome of the school bully. The Coachmaster lures boys by the promise of a life of fun and enjoyment, however they are duly punished by him.In conclusion, Disney's Pinocchio is a tribute to old-fashioned storytelling. While Disney may have been a bit too creative with the original Collodi story, he triumphantly succeeds in canvassing perhaps one of some of the greatest concepts in humanity. That of Good and Evil, Redemption, loyalty and sacrifice. Disney was no doubt successful in transferring Collodi's timeless moral onto the screen."], ["A new favourite added to my favourite animated movies of all time from the Disney canon.", "I never seen this movie in my life till I got it on DVD for the Xmas as Disney is re-releasing all their movies on DVD and Blu-ray for a limited time only. I remember seeing a live action version of this years ago on TV so I knew what to expect once I seen Disney's version. The story is about a wooden puppet named Pinocchio who comes to life thanks to a blue fairy who granted Gepitto(who of course made him in the first place as his a wood carver who makes clocks and puppets)a wish to have Pinocchio become a real boy. So when he does come to life he has to obey orders and learn from right and wrong. Accompanying him is a cricket called Jimmy who is the narrator of this movie as he tells the tale of the puppet who wants to become a real boy. Jimmy acts as Pinocchio's conscience and has to teach him all kinds of things in order to become real. Pinocchio later meets a wolf who only uses him for some puppet show,then Pinocchio is sent to some isolated island with a bunch of kids who later transform into donkeys(don't ask)and his father missing as he is inside a whale.So can Pinocchio prove that he can learn from right and wrong and make his father(or creator's) wish come true?Overall from start to finish I loved this movie as it was my first time to watch it last night on DVD. The animation is beautiful,the story is fantastic and the theme tune for this movie ended up being a global sensation as Disney's theme for the opening of their movies.Overall if you are like me a fan of animated movies and want to try and see something that you never seen before I recommend this to anyone.Parts of this movie reminded me of that made for TV cartoon called The Scarecrow where the scarecrow comes to life by a fairy and becomes a real human only he can see his scarecrow reflection and has to give his life for someone in order for the spell to be permanent?. Maybe it was just me but having said that buy this movie(Pinocchio) on DVD you won't regret it.10/10"], ["Pinochio - A Disney Masterpiece of Shakespearean Proportions", "I am glad to have lived long enough to even start to really appreciate this animated film. Of course, \"Snow White\" was seen as the turning point in animation between stick figures with ears traced around nickles and dimes and characters that reflected truly lifelike creations; between complete story lines and short skits. This is true but \"Pinochio\" raised the bar with its animation to a level that still astonishes me even though computer animation should have desensitized me to its virtuosity. To have made \"Pinochio\" manually is a testament to the ingenuity of the human mind and the dexterity of the human hand. It is also a testament to the fact that true craftsmen are never satisfied by merely creating something that pleases an audience; they need to satisfy the urge to create something that identifies them as unique. Samuel Johnson said of Shakespeare that he need not have created such masterpieces written in iambic pentameter to have satisfied his audience. Look at every scene in Pinochio and you see craft and sophisticated thought beyond what an audience might require. There are visual puns, there is detail that only by stopping the frame that one can appreciate and there is attention to acting skills invested in each character. Any director of a live film can point a camera at actors performing and get some added interest by accident but, in animation,everything is intentional.Nothing in the background has not been scrupulously considered and meticulously drawn. In live action, each scene can be covered from various angles and then cut. Look at how Pinochio, \"Honest\" John and Gideon are seen from above as they gambol off to meet the coach for \"Pleasure Island\". It has to be drawn that way. How many hours of watching live actors and translating it into animation must that have taken? Did they really need to do it? No. But I am sure that the animators considered it a great challenge to their craft. Thanks to them all for making \"Pinochio\" and for enriching my understanding of what human beings can achieve."], ["\"Oh, I think it's swell...\"", "Okay, I'm gonna be saying \"I love\" a lot in this review, so I'm afraid you'll just have to bear with me! It's just that there is so very much to love in this classic, I remember it all so well... Pinocchio is for me, Disney homebase. I find it the most magical, mystical, frightening - from my point of view truly the best work they ever did. It's so magnificent in so many different ways and it will hold up forever. There's so many great characters, Dickie Jones' voice was very cute, I actually learned how to whistle with the help of the second song. The Blue Fairy is a stunningly radiant gossamer creation of heavenly grace, in as much her warm bearing as her design. She breaks her own cardinal rule of not helping out twice though! I love the bratty little expressions of impish Figaro, he moves just like a real kitten. Gepetto's so mean when he's using the as-yet inanimate(and ~creepy~) Pinocchio to spook Figaro and kick him up the butt! And I love little relationship he and sweet Cleo the goldfish have together and how she wants nothing more than to be the stubborn cat's friend! I find the scene really charming and funny where Gepetto goes out to search for Pinocchio and Figaro immediately wants to eat his dinner but Cleo forbids it and he obeys, it's so adorable. She even manages to be cute during a very sad scene where she's preparing her own grave! The delicate effect of her fins as she swirls about is superb. I love the numerous rich details and touches that are in any given scene, particularly the opening sequence with all the precious clocks trinkets and music boxes, which I think is one of the more visually breathtaking moments in the film. I still remember how I felt when I first saw it when I was really little. Everything about all the sights and sounds of the intricate little devices and toys entranced me, and filled my young mind with wonder... And it actually still does, I have never lost that whenever I watch that magnificent sequence. The way Geppeto switches everything on to celebrate mirrors the ending. The enchanting and brilliant sequence where they're under the sea is my all-time favourite underwater Disney animating, even more so than \"The Little Mermaid.\" It's really funny and captivating with all the curious sea life cautiously following close behind, and Jiminy riding on a seahorse. Good job they dived in when they did, Jiminy was about to transform into a little asshopper(!) But they're all living under a dark cloud, as even the lowly clam has learned to fear the wrath of Mighty Monstro! The final act is just incredible and ups the ante in terms of action no limit. Just what the heck kinda demonic whale was Monsto meant to be anyway? He's more like a colossal, juggernaut engine of towering destruction than a living creature. There's such an awesome sense of momentum and force in the movements as he twists and bulldozes through the ocean after them like a freight-train, only to end up inadvertently pushing them out of harm's reach in the end with his own power. How on earth did they manage to draw and animate all the ripples, bubbles, foam, swells and general tumult in that churning ocean so realistically? They must've driven themselves half-crazy with the effort! I appreciate very much how the film doesn't pander and is at times quite bleak and poignant, like when Gepetto's searching for Pinocchio in the rain and the coach that he just happens to be on goes right by. So close and yet so far... And in the scene that always gets me a little teary eyed where they return to the cottage to find it barren and empty, which is something that I find so achingly sad and heartbreaking. And there's also the lament scene inside the whale. These parts are not very reassuring, but they sure are emotionally powerful. Although much of it is bright and whimsical, the darkness of this movie has its value as well. Not everything works out perfectly nice for everybody. How quickly Stromboli becomes terrifying as he flies off into a rage and violently slams little Pinoccio into the cage of certain doom, switching the whole tone of the suspiciously jovial scene as he does so. And the donkey transformation was even more horrendous than I remembered. The way Lampwick cries out for his mama is so grisly and disturbing. And all the poor misbehaving boys who are just left as donkeys forever on cursed Pleasure Island forever and never seen again, and the wicked man running the place who's never defeated - there's some serious grimness to it, and that's a good thing and I'll tell you why. This world can be a very cruel place, and especially as kids we can never be too sure about strangers, even if they appear very generous at first. And the chilling glamour of Pleasure Island teaches that, if something seems too good to be true it probably is, and those are still good lessons I think. And although the ending is a happy one and does indeed leave you with a positive and hopeful feeling, the movie still takes you on many emotional twists and turns before it reaches that grand point, it's very much earned. My last word might sound a bit corny..but what they did with this, their work, way back then, it was so beautiful, and we'll always remember it. This timeless masterpiece is Disney's brightest star forever, and I now look back on it with a very warm sense of nostalgic wonder..."], ["Probably Disney's best film", "Pinocchio was the only the second ever animated film made by Disney and should rightfully be considered a milestone for animation. The film is easily one of the company's best and has barely dated. It features some of their best work which includes wonderful animation, memorable characters and a really engaging story.The plot sees inventor Geppetto create a wooden puppet named Pinocchio and he wishes for him to be real, the Blue Fairy decides to grant his wish. She gives Pinocchio a conscience in the form of a cricket called Jiminy to keep him out of trouble and if he behaves he can become a real boy. However Jiminy is given a difficult job as Pinocchio frequently faces the wrong types of temptation and it's an uphill struggle to avoid trouble. The plot is brilliant as it quickly moves from one sticky situation to another, never slowing long enough to be boring. The film has plenty of light and dark moments while talking about smart subject matter which keeps everyone entertained.The characters are excellent. Pinocchio isn't the most interesting of leads but he's supposed to be na\u00efve, curious and easily led astray much like any young boy so it's a successful role. Jiminy is a lot of fun, always trying and failing to keep Pinocchio in line. He's laid back but has his limits while his exasperation leads to good comedy and his kind nature makes him likable. Geppetto comes across as a kind man, while silent pets Figaro and Cleo have some very funny moments. Honest John and mostly mute Gideon are an excellent double team and the funniest comic pieces come from their slapstick as well as strange humour. Both Stromboli and the Coachman are two of Disney's most sinister villains, Stromboli being intimidatingly loud and the Coachman restrainedly creepy. The Blue Fairy is a pretty decent guide.The animation is outstanding and some of the best Disney has ever done. When it wants things to be bright and cheerful it adds some beautiful scenery or colours, the scenes in Geppetto's house show that. While for the dark scenes it keeps a great gloomy and murky look, the Red Lobster Inn scene being prime example. A brilliant aspect to the film is the dark tone that it takes on. It never shy's away from the terrible things that can happen if you do wrong and can be rather frightening, the scenes of the kids turning into Donkeys at Pleasure Island and the whole climax with wild whale Monstro are now classic scary scenes. The fact that all the villains never get punished makes it different from the norm and it reflects real life in that way. The film does have a strong emotion impact, when it wants you to feel happy or sad or scared it makes you feel that way with ease whether it be via the artwork and the atmosphere. The music is superb too and the score itself is very memorable, the songs are fantastic as well as rightful classics including 'When You Wish Upon A Star' and 'An Actors Life For Me'.Overall Pinocchio is by far one of Disney's finest films and is a combination of everything great about the company."], ["Still a magical film", "This is by far my favorite \"Disney\" film. I was a small child when I first saw this at the Drive-in with my family in 1971. It is still one of my favorite childhood memories.This film is about a puppet coming to life. He is aided by a cricket who is his conscience. If \"Pinocchio\" acts brave worthy and unselfish he will then become a real boy. His journey to become a real boy is feast for your \"eyes and ears\"This film is a masterpiece.

It is a very adult movie under cover of a child's movie. Dialogue is of the highest quality and it has a message about the pitfalls of trusting bad company, mendacity, and a few other sins, and how the reverse, courage and nobility of spirit, can make all the difference, with the symbolism of Pinocchio becoming a \"real boy\" by the movie's end.Direction has not been more assured in any movie, animated or otherwise. Photography is to die for, absolutely exquisite. The detail is astonishing, beginning with all the clocks in the introduction, and the outstanding scene of Pinocchio coming up to the fish bowl but with the glass distortion he might as well have been in front of one of those mirrors at fairs, where you alternately become tall, short, or fat.The attention to detail is beyond compare but the finest item of all is the animation, which remains peerless today, all the CGI and other computer-related technology progresses notwithstanding.It is a work of genius, without a shot or a second to spare, the nearest thing to perfection, blending humor with deeply frightening sequences such as Pleasure Island, Monstro, and the climax, with Pinocchio dead but about to be resuscitated because he earned it. In the process, it has been a road trip in which a wooden toy has become a full human being.I have watched Pinocchio more times than I can recall, and every time I do so, there is a new detail, a new beautiful scene to be savored, and it reminds of how lucky I am to be able to see it while most of mankind has never set eyes on it, and probably does not even know of its existence. 10/10"], ["PINOCCHIO: Second in line but Top of the List", "While my personal favorite Disney feature is THE THREE CABALLEROS, I consider PINOCCHIO the greatest. This 1940 film is gracefully executed and dramatically powerful in its range of depicted emotions felt by on screen characters, as well as in how well (and how many of) those responses are evoked within viewers.I first saw PINOCCHIO at age seven. It wasn't even the first cartoon feature I ever watched; yet more than 50 years later, I still don't feel I have ever seen finer or more subtle character animation on film. For one quick example: the brief shot (during Gepetto's \"Little Woodenhead\" song) from Cleo's point of view, presenting the not-yet-living puppet being marched by strings toward her goldfish bowl. The visual distortion of Pinocchio's movement, as seen through both water and the glass bowl, is brilliantly rendered -- AND we immediately grasp why the distortion terrifies the tiny fish.By the time his studio created those features, Walt Disney was no longer contributing any of the physical artwork; but the films benefited from his detailed supervision and gift for story analysis. One studio history which I've read does quote Disney as having told one employee, as PINOCCHIO finally was completed, \"I will never work that hard again.\" That declaration probably explains why PINOCCHIO was never equaled -- by Disney or by any other team."], ["Arguably the greatest animated feature ever made", "I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature.The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background.The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs.Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list.Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out."], ["A definite 10", "I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this.I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc.It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses.Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song.Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, \"Pinocchio\" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away.Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro.The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D.Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never."], ["Pinocchio is still celebrated as one of the Disney's greatest achievements.", "Based on Carlo Collodi's didactic fable of 1881, the film transforms the delinquency of Pinocchio and the cruel anarchy of childhood into a rites-of-passage story of innocence, redemption and American heroism - albeit one populated by Dickensian grotesques. Pinocchio was embraced by critics but resulted in an initial box office failure. The $2.6 million outlay seemed unlikely to be recouped, particularly as the European market had been shut down by the outbreak of the Second World War, but subsequent re-releases bolstered the film's reputation and ensured that it ran into profit. Pinocchio represents the defining moment in the evolution of Disney's style, which was predicated partly on 'realist' authenticity and partly on caricaturial innovation. The film's greatest achievements are Hamilton Luske's sensitive direction of live-action movement that was then used as rotoscoped animation; Bob Jones's three-dimensional models of key interiors; Bill Tytla's striking animation of the muscular energy of Stromboli; Oscar Fischinger's 'wand-sparkle' for the Blue Fairy; and Woolie Reitherman's extraordinary animation of Monstro the whale. The involvement of such talented technicians and artists contributed to the trend in animation towards the cinematic conventions of the 'real' and the fullest emotive exploitation of the mise en scene while demonstrating and celebrating the freedoms of self-conscious artifice. This aesthetic contradiction still underpins the orthodoxies of feature animation today, but has rarely been achieved with such graphic detail and emotional intensity."], ["Perhaps as perfect as any film can get", "It really sometimes is a shame that the name \"Disney\" has become associated with childish fancy and mass-market film production. Whilst it would be buffoonery to deny that such things have always come out of the Disney studio, the association with silliness and fabricated maternal comfort really discredits the likes of \"Pinocchio\". Based on the Italian author Carlo Collodi's story about the puppet with a knack for getting into trouble, it was only the second animated feature put out by Disney. It is also perhaps the best animated film to have seen the light of day - yes, even beating \"Toy Story\" and all of the other beloved Pixar films.Technically speaking, everything that \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" did well is done even better in \"Pinocchio\"; the scope and attention to detail are greater, the music and songs are of a higher level (\"When You Wish Upon a Star\" has indeed gone on to become the anthem of Disney and of hope in general) and the animation seems more confident and fluid. Yet the main reason \"Pinocchio\" works is that it truly seizes upon the opportunity of going beyond being merely a fantastical fable and provides a story that resonates with the soul of an individual in the world of reality. It doesn't simply patronise or moralise the audience; as with a select other few films including \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"E.T.\" and \"Am\u00e9lie\", the fantasy on screen succeeds so well in that it truly parables that of an everyday society devoid of magic - and allows for criticism of accepted attitudes.In creating a mythical world, the plot is truly complex and deals with with so many timeless themes in some form or another - responsibility, love, morality and exploitation are just some examples. It equally strays very much from being a pick-me-up in the way that the likes of \"Snow White\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" might be, and there are countless truly thrilling or downright scary moments, in particular the scene in which the lazy yet naive delinquent Lampwick meets his fate. There are far more antagonists in \"Pinocchio\" than the average Disney favourite, all of whom - unlike the numerous femmes fatales and odious beings in other films - do not appear on screen after their subsequent wrong doings and arguably remain unpunished, much like the villains of everyday life. One can thus imagine that Honest John and Gideon are conning even more victims or that the systematic horrors of Pleasure Island shall continue. This is what truly makes the scenes of cruelty so disturbing; underneath all of its fantastical trimmings, its sheer acceptance certainly resonates with a society of any generation (consider that this film was made and released simultaneously to policies of appeasement and the ultimate road to war).Yet there are moments of happiness, hope and joy in \"Pinocchio\", and their place in a film often so frank with the often questionable behaviour of a society makes them all the more wonderful and joyous. \"Pinocchio\" is quite frankly one of the best things ever captured on celluloid."], ["When You Wish Upon a Star!", "This is a beautiful movie, not as good as Snow white and Bambi, but it is right up there with the classics. The animation is flawless, and I loved how they animated the Blue Fairy. She was beautiful! The songs are absolutely magnificent, the best being \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", which strangely reminds me of Christmas and never fails to bring tears to my eyes. The characters are unforgettable, and what a talented voice cast to bring Carlo Collodi's characters to life. Pinocchio is appealing enough, and Geopetto was inspiring. Figaro was really funny, although he never speaks,but his facial expressions are priceless, and Jiminy Cricket is my favourite character. Honest John and his feline sidekick were also great fun, as well as the cruel Stromboli. And I mustn't forget the terrifying Monstro the whale-and the coachman(prepare for nightmares)- who reminds me of a larger version of Jaws the Shark.

I have read the book as well, but I still think that Disney did the right thing by making Pinocchio likable from the start, allowing us to really feel for him and share his world more easily. The little puppet gets very hard-earned lessons in responsibility, truthfulness, bravery, and selflessness. The trip to Pleasure Island stands out in most folks' memory because of the \"Donkey sequence\", but I was never frightened by that part.What scared me was The Coachman. Here we have one of the most evil characters ever to grace the world of film, and yet he is almost forgotten. Consider this: the island itself is not cursed; it only changes one's outside to match the nature of the soul inside. We see the results of carnal frenzy indulged, the basest desires are here encouraged and granted beyond sane measure (gluttony, anger, destruction, greed, theft, etc.). By living like animals, the children sacrifice their humanity in the purest way possible. Can you imagine what would happen if Virtue was encouraged in this place? What would they become if that were so?The Coachman is truly wicked because he is making a great profit by twisting not only the fools he picks up, but by perverting the island itself to his own ends!That being said, this truly IS one of the greatest animated works ever made, and deserves to be in everyone's collection."], ["A Disney Classic!!!", "In a small Italian village, a lonely woodcarver named Geppetto makes a marionette, who he calls Pinocchio.

I think what contributes to the richness of this film is the detailed thought in the storytelling. The best example of this is the characterization of Jiminy Cricket. In this version the cricket is someone who has been around a bit. He makes a good conscience cause he knows what to look out for. He sees through \"Honest John\" without any trouble, and he suspects Pleasure Island from the start, even if he doesn't know the secret behind it. He is not some two-dimensional puritanical moralist who just mouths brainless platitudes. He is allowed to have human characteristics (he has a massive crush on The Blue Fairy, and he is quite willing to try and duck out of trouble when he appears at fault as in the birdcage scene.) Compare that with say the 1990s version THE ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO; where the character just gives cute sayings.One of the most fascinating lines is when Jiminy says \"What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?\" after seeing Pinocchio's apparent success with Stromboli. It harks back to the old puritanical notion of acting being an inherently immoral profession, as summed up in the phrase \"Life upon the wicked stage\"; and something which early Hollywood had no qualms in alluding to with their stories.It's just an example of the rich depth that a supposedly simplistic old children's film actually has."], ["When you wish upon a star you get Pinocchio.", "Pinocchio is probably not one of my favorite Disney movies, but it has a special place in my heart.

Its also not uncommon to hear comparisons between Jiminy Cricket and anyone notable for responsibility and seriousness. The script of this film doesn't portray faithfully the tale of Collodi, but recreates it and rewrites it, giving it a much more didactic and educational aspect. That makes this movie a very good help for parents in their task, always thorny, of educate.The work of the voices is very good and drawings, made the old fashioned way, show us some of the most interesting scenes of the early films of this iconic studio.

I like the song about letting your conscious be your mind. This whole movie teaches about your conscious and about the consequences of life.

And it's easy to see why. It's a stunningly beautiful film. Everything from the fluidity of movement to the facial expressions to the softness of colours to the amazingly detailed backgrounds speaks of hundreds of hours of loving toil and attention to detail. The whale scene alone, with water splashing everywhere, each and every droplet of seawater drawn and animated by hand. It's bewildering to imagine them doing this.And, like it predecessor Snow White, it has held up remarkably well as a story as well. You can still see some of the episodic nature of the animated shorties in it, but not as much as in Snow White. The scenes flow from one to another rather hurriedly and sometimes the plot loses you in time, but the story itself is always moving forward. Every scene is extremely memorable and for many people this is the film that has stuck with them from their childhood. Partly because a good chunk of the scenes are startlingly dark for a film aimed primarily for children, and partly because of the quality of the characters and the story.Pinocchio is one of those films you like as a child, but which you will grow to love as an adult. As an adult your attention is drawn to the gorgeousness of the art and you can appreciate even the darkest moments because they make the ending shine even brighter in comparison. A film most have already seen, but if you haven't seen this Disney gem yet, do yourself a favour.

Apparently, this second full-length animated feature from Disney (of many) wasn't very successful upon its original release in 1940. However, through the generations, \"Pinocchio\", an adaptation of the story by Carlo Collodi, has generally been regarded as a classic, just like so many other Disney films, both early and recent, and it appears that it spawned many re-releases over the course of several decades! So, since its original release, it has had so much well-deserved belated success!One night, Jiminy Cricket comes into the shop of an inventor named Gepetto, and witnesses him putting the finishing touches on wooden marionette, and trying it out. Gepetto names this marionette Pinocchio. Just before he goes to sleep, the inventor looks out the window and sees a wishing star, so he makes a wish. His wish is for his new marionette to become a real boy! While Gepetto is asleep, and Jiminy is still awake, the Blue Fairy comes in and partially grants the inventor his wish, making Pinocchio alive, but still wooden. In order for Gepetto's wish to be fully granted, Pinocchio will have to prove himself \"brave, truthful, and unselfish.\" Jiminy is assigned by the Fairy to be Pinocchio's conscience. The next morning, after Gepetto sends Pinocchio to school, the living marionette is soon mislead, going somewhere else, and Jiminy Cricket finds that getting him to listen to his conscience isn't easy!As you would expect from an animated Disney flick, this is a musical, and as such, it has several memorable songs, including the Oscar-winning \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", along with \"Give a Little Whistle\", and others. It's also a very adventurous piece, and has a bit of humour (including a couple hilarious early scenes involving Honest John and the clumsy Gideon), as well as moments of sadness or fright, and some morals, such as telling the truth. Overall, \"Pinocchio\" is a bit darker than most other films in Disney's catalogue, whether you would consider that a good or bad thing.

This is a pleasant little story with plenty of imagination and lessons to be learned, and this will appeal to smaller children. I enjoyed this film when I was younger because it portrays life in a more realistic way, and Pinocchio must learn the consequences to his actions and poor judgement.

While it's easy to understand why this film remains a classic, it's most important to understand the roots for its main song, which has become the national anthem for the Walt Disney Company.When You Wish Upon a Star is not simply a hauntingly heartwarming melody on its own, but it is also a very important message to those who dream. Although obviously metaphorical (I mean a wish isn't granted just like that), the general idea that it just might is a splendidly happy dream altogether. Everyone has their own dreams and aspirations, and as long as they give the right amount of dedication their dream deserves, then they'll accomplish wonders and earn said goal. Walt Disney himself said it best, \"If you can dream it, you can do it.\", which perfectly coincides to what the titular character went through to become a real boy.Originally, Pinocchio was supposed to be arrogant and cocky like in the original book this film was based on, but I'm glad they went with the decision to make him more innocent and oddball. When you're a child, you learn the world at your own pace, so the dangers and obstacles Pinocchio encounters are a frightening but vital lesson to understand what's right and wrong in the world. Although Jimmy Cricket isn't the best conscience, he still does his best to keep Pinocchio out of harm's way so the wooden boy can improve and get better overtime. I'm sure at the end of the day, we all want to improve from our mistakes, but we must remember said mistakes so we can have a better knowledge on life. That way we really can prove how loyal and good we are, not unlike Pinocchio.From a technical standpoint, the animation is fantastic for its time, and it still looks breathtaking to this day. Along with fluid and upbeat character animation, the colors are nothing short of eye candy, the backgrounds have a very rich European aesthetic to them, and the effects are so well designed that it's hard to imagine how they crafted them. The use of the multiplane camera is another highlight, as the backgrounds move in a more realistic and brisk pace that gives each piece of art a chance to be seen and judged on its own merits.The characters are also charming and lovable, from the kind hearted albeit absent minded Geppetto, to the deliciously malicious Honest John and Gideon, to the adorable Figaro and Cleo. Whether they be supporters or obstacles for Pinocchio, they all fit the story well enough to drive the film along. However, the villains are another story, as unlike most Disney films, they don't get outsmarted by the protagonists and end up getting away with their crimes. This presents them in a more realistic manner and it's not hard to feel disturbed by their actions. Not to mention, the voice-acting is splendid and each actor gives just the right amount of spunk, personality and even relatability to keep the audience entertained and invested.While many animated Disney films like Snow White, Beauty & the Beast, Fantasia, The Lion King and Zootopia definitely deserve the acclaim they've received, I think Pinocchio will forever be the companies' crowning achievement. The message to follow your dreams while doing your best to be a better person has become a key message for Disney, and considering they are the company where dreams (supposedly) come true, it fits the bill superbly. So definitely have fun with this movie, but also remember how important it is to believe in your dreams so that one day they might come true, and it starts with you getting there."], ["iconic Disney classic", "Jiminy Cricket recounts the time he seek warmth in woodcarver Gepetto's home.

Despite that, Pinocchio keeps getting in trouble and every time he tells a lie, his nose starts to grow.This is such an iconic Disney movie. Pinocchio is a terrific character. He's well drawn and well written. He is a fully realized fallible boy. His struggle is filled with morality lessons. The songs are wonderful with the magical \"When You Wish Upon A Star\". Jiminy Cricket is the most fun mentor any child can have. This is a wonderful movie through and through.

This is because of a great writer (Ted Sears, 1900-1958) they had at the time and because of Walt Disney who could recognize a good story.Ted Sears's source was a nearly forgotten periodical serial originally written in Italy by 19th Century children's fairy tale writer, Carlo Collodi. (Birth name, Carlo Lorenzini). Lorenzini wrote Storia di un burattino (\"The story of a marionette\"), Sears assembled the best stories from the serial first published in Il Giornale dei Bambini (The Children's Journal) the first periodical for children, and created the script for Pinocchio. This was a time when Disney, still working on Snow White but seeing what was about to manifest in the world, pulled out all the stops and with his top flight, hand selected staff that included today's well-known animation artist's names, created Pinocchio. Fortunately, Walt Disney wisely refused to use well-known voices of the period so the characters remain freshly unfettered by latent image conflicts with real life images.Popular artist, Thomas Kinkaid, recognized the perennial greatness of this film and followed his Snow White painting with one the Pinocchio. That painting will be important as long as the film remains popular...for at least one hundred years or more from today. The painting consists of and depicts every major scene and character in the film.//Ra\u00fal daSilva, author, first place national book festival prizewinner, The World of animation (Kodak, 1979)."], ["Just Incredible-This is the star where dreams came true", "If people say this film is bad, then they don't know the meaning of bad.

Not only was it the first Technicolor feature-length film, but it also set incredible new standards for animated colour and detail, aided by pioneering use of the multiplane camera. Three years later, Disney released a further two feature-length offerings, both of which proved initially unprofitable, but have since grown in stature to become indelible classics of American animation. 'Pinocchio (1940)' and 'Fantasia (1940)' are two wholly different feature films: whilst the latter is almost experimental in nature, a compilation of music-inspired segments that Disney envisioned as a \"roadshow event,\" the former film is much closer to the spirit of Disney's previous success, adapting Carlo Collodi's 1883 story \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" as a heart-filled children's tale, occasionally dark in tone, but never lacking a child-like sense of wonder.An old and lonely toymaker, Geppetto (voiced by Christian Rub), has made a life out of bringing happiness to young children, and his homely cottage is filled with creative cuckoo-clocks and other whirring wooden contraptions. Aside from his two loyal pets, Figaro the cat and Cleo the goldfish, Geppetto lives a lonesome existence, and yearns for the love of a real child. One night, after finally completing a dancing wooden puppet named Pinocchio, the old inventor wishes upon a star that his creation be made into a real boy, never imagining for a moment that his wish might actually come true. In the basking glow of the moonlight, the beautiful Blue Fairy (Evelyn Venable) materialises in the silent bedroom, and, as our humble presenter Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Edwards) watches from the shadows, the static wooden puppet is magically given life, and must prove himself worthy before he is transformed into a \"real boy.\" Jiminy agrees to act as Pinocchio's conscience, steering him towards the path of righteousness, a task that proves considerably more difficult and dangerous than he could have imagined.As was the case in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' the animators offer audiences so many colourful characters that at least one is bound to become your favourite. If the film's modest heroes don't strike your fancy, then you might also choose from the sly fox, J. Worthington \"Honest John\" Foulfellow (Walter Catlett) or his mute sidekick Gideon (Mel Blanc), who attempt to exploit Pinocchio for their own profit. There's also Stromboli (Charles Judels), the greedy Italian puppeteer, Lampwick (Frankie Darro) the mischievous little scamp who finds himself turning into a donkey, and Monstro, the immense, horrifying sperm whale whose heaving form instills terror in every marine creature in the ocean. The film's animation, though perhaps not quite as vibrantly colourful as in 'Snow White,' is impeccably detailed, and often exceedingly beautiful.

It might have not sparked up as much fascination when it was first released as Snow White and Dumbo did (apparently this and Fantasia did poorly on first release), but over time it's definitely got its place in the pantheon of truly wonderful works by the company. It tells a story that even babies can grasp- something that isn't really real that wants to be so for his creator. In fact, this is probably one of the most palatable stories for kids, about the dire straits of not just trying to fit in, but being a kid and still having to learn responsibilities, truth and courage. Of course, few kids will ever see their friends turn into donkeys or get thrown into the belly of a whale. But it's such out-of-this-world things that make the film so fantastic and terrifying in equal measure. It might lack the overall surreal whammy of Dumbo and Alice in Wonderland, yet in a small group of leaving a lasting impact Pinocchio has its unique bits.It's got about all that someone could ask for with an animated film, for kids and adults alike. It's got plenty of colorful side characters, both sweet and clumsy and goofy and smart (all taking up the animals like Figaro, the Goldfish, and especially the iconic Jiminy Cricket), as well as ignorant, villainous and evil (Lampwick, Stromboli and Honest John among others). All of these characters are so rich in their simple characterizations that the combination of the old vocal talents- meant more for direct style and appearance instead of star power like in todays animation- and the distinct look of each character, make them all compelling to one degree or another. Just thinking about the scenes with Stromboli, for example, make me think that there had to be someone that imposing and larger-than-life in appearance acting it out as opposed to just the drawing being that. Only the Blue Fairy is the bland type, drawn in the Snow White style. But then the rest of the picture- particularly for Pinocchio and Gepetto- is up for grabs with whatever can be done with them.So much emotion actually comes out of scenes. And it alternates very well, much as in fairy tales and other fantastical fiction. Pinocchio performs \"I've got no strings\" in one scene, which is one of the typical highlights, and then the next scene such sweetness gets contrasted with the defeat imposed by the evil Stromboli. What leaves the biggest impression, however, is Fantasy island, where all the boys who don't want to go to school go to, and soon enough (from Cricket's own words), become donkeys. I would probably rank that transformation scene of Lampwick's, by the way, as one of the top 5 scenes in any animated effort ever produced; it starts off kind of amusing, the way Pinocchio tries to put down the cigar, and then becomes like a child's true nightmare as we see his full-on transformation. It's an example of using abstractions that always work best in fairy tales, and somehow has become lost among the constant barrage of juvenile CGI films as of late. Seeing work like this again reminds one of the completeness given in well-rounded (if 2-dinemnsional) stories.It's got action, music, pomp and circumstance, countless chances at very goofy gags and silly puns, and somehow it all works just as well- if not better in a way- as an adult as when I was a kid. Is it cheesy at times and maybe here and there hitting points home a little hard? Sure. But I never had any dis-liking to the characters, never really felt that I was being cheated with motivations or in some kind of truth in the un-reality of it all. Not to sound cheesy myself, but it is a timeless kind of picture, with a story that when told well can strike a chord with just about anyone willing for the experience. It's old-fashioned sensibilities are still resonant, and the production values are all top-notch."], ["An Animation Masterpiece", "Recently, I resumed my goal to watch all of the Disney feature films.

My goodness. I could not have been more impressed with it. There are so many 'perfect' moments in that movie. Truly Disney created animation magic like no other. The plot retained points from the book it was based on, but gave the main character a whole new demeanor. Naive and curious, Pinocchio repeatedly stumbles into trouble, while Jiminy Cricket, acting as his 'conscience', tries to keep him away from it by teaching him right from wrong. The mood and overall feel to the story is warm and very cozy, especially at the beginning, and you get used to it right away. The characters are filled with the charm Disney is known for.I could go on about the positive attributes to the atmosphere, but it goes so much deeper than that. Pinocchio differs from other Disney movies in the way that no villains are truly punished for their crimes. It's almost truthful, really. Not every crook pays for his wrong-doings.In addition, there are less than cheerful moments. The scene on Pleasure Island when Lampwick becomes a donkey is actually scary. The use of perspective is very clever on many occasions, and the whole movie is very atmospheric in some way or other.

Some people like Charlie Chaplain had a good idea, but nobody made films with the suspense and fascination Pinocchio had.  The scene where Monstro attacks was really the first film to use size and scope and tell a story with characters that you cared about with hardly any dialogue.  Think about it.  There's the huge whale on one scale; every move of its fins creates tidal waves.  There's Pinocchio on another scale; trying to swim for his life so that he won't be swallowed.

We also were treated to the notion of the Wicked Queen's order to her hunter to kill Snow White and bring her heart back as proof of his obedience, the over eager pair of vultures following the Witch-Queen and the reaction of Miss Snow to the spell laden, poisoned apple.MOVING along swiftly, we can cite such horrific incidents in subsequent pictures as: FANTASIA (Walt Disney/RKO, 1940)-the Night On Bald Mountain-Ave Maria Sequence, DUMBO (Walt Disney/RKO, 1941)-Dumbo's Mother being chained, imprisoned and separated from the little pachyderm, BAMBI (Walt Disney/RKO, 1942)- Bambi's Mother killed by hunters, THE ADVENTURES OF ICHABOD & MR. TOAD (Disney/RKO, 1949)-Sleepy Hollow sequence with the Headless Horseman, LADY AND THE TRAMP (Walt Disney Productions/Buena Vista Releasing Company, 1954)-Trusty's being run over by the Wagon, and even THE JUNGLE BOOK (Disney/Buena Vista, 1967)-Balu's seemingly mortal wounds after fighting Tiger.THERE were others, of course.AS for PINNOCCHIO, the horrifying element is one that has a great effect on this writer when he saw it at approximately 8 years old was the \"Pleasure Island \"scenes in which the foolish boys are led down the primrose path to the tender trap of drinking beer, smoking cigars and shooting pool; all the while they're duped into thinking that this is such a smart behavioural path. Before long, and too late for them to realize it, the young wise-guy wannabees are being transformed into Donkeys, being rounded up for shipment and life long service in the salt mines!THIS is perhaps the highest use of the Horrific Moment Syndrome; for there is a real morale with this one. On the strictly literal level, all in the audience know that schoolboys' drinking beer and smoking stogies; while patronizing a pool hall is a bad idea. While the transformation into Donkeys is astounding, disturbing and a great attention getter; it is, all things considered, a fantastic occurrence and not even plausible to a child.NOW, as a sort of parable or fable, it is quite a different story. As a metaphor for life, \"Pleasure Island\" represents all of the temptation that one encounters on our journey through life. The free beer, plentiful cigars, the Pool Hall and all of the carnival-like attractions we see are representative of how we can waste our time away from schooling and pursuing helpful, wholesome and productive pursuits; until it is too late and we are barred from achieving higher stations in life and work. We are in danger of becoming figurative \"Donkeys labouring in the Salt Mines.\"AS for the rest of the production, it is an absolute delight. The characters, the scenery, the music and the trouble that the little Wooden Boy gets into are all amusing and make for the proverbial \"Never a Dull Moment.\" The songs are all very good and all were fit well into the storyline. Highlights from the Musical Part of the movie are the immortal \"When You Wish Upon A Star\"(an Academy Award Winner?), sung by Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket; and the bouncy and energetic \"Hi Diddle Dee-Dee\"; which led the animated wooden doll to slave conditions as prisoner of the mean, old Gypsy Puppeteer, Stromboli. (Hey, that itself is another sort of minor horrific sequence! No?)THAT we have had a long standing axiom that there are only a limited number of plots (No Schultz, not \"plotz\"!), is pretty much a universally accepted belief. Variations on a small number of scenarios account for just about any and every story that we can think of. So, just what does this mean for the tale of the \"Little Wooden Head\" (another of the lesser songs)?OUR theory may shock you, it may scare you, it may even horrify you; for you see we see PINNOCCHIO, either as written by Carlo Collodi** or as rendered by Mr. Disney and crew is after all a variation on the same theme as Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' and the long line of Universal Pictures Horror Flicks! Just you think about it!NOTE * We're pretty sure that old Walt wouldn't approve of a lot of the sh*t that they put out under some of their subsidiary companies' names.NOTE: ** I guess it must have been just pure ignorance, but it was many a year that had gone by before I realized that Pinnocchio is an Italian story, by an Italian author set in (where else?) Italy. Apologies to all of our Italian Buddies!POODLE SCHNITZ!!"], ["Truly an animated classic", "In my opinion, this is one of Disney's best animated films of all time. Take a look at all the brilliant background art and the effects, all done by hand.  I especially like the blurred vision of the eight ball that Pinocchio is trying to shoot after he inhales too much nicotine from his cigar.  The Disney animators were really good at giving emotional feeling to different scenes in the movie.  For example, the warm, fun, relaxing atmosphere of Gepetto's workshop contrasts greatly with the scary scene of Lampwick's transformation into a donkey at Pleasure Island.  I feel that this just isn't as good when done with computer and the films themselves were better back in those days.  Disney wasn't afraid of offending anyone or frightening children.  Do you think the donkey scene would be included if this movie had been produced today?  It is very doubtful, considering that Disney's films of today are beginning to look rather bland in their political correctness. If you have never seen this movie, I suggest you go buy it or rent it.  This is a classic that no Disney fan/animation buff should be without.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["My Favorite Disney", "Pinocchio is the most developed of Disney's classic animated films.  The artwork, character design, narrative, and plotting all work perfectly.  The film is much more adult than the modern Disney tales.  Many of the things in it are quite frightening, especially the sequence where the boys turn into jackasses.  The temptations that the young wooden boy faces are as realistic as any in a Martin Scorese movie.  It is an excellent allegory for growing up and taking moral responsibility for one's actions.  Even with all of the advanced material that it contains, it still appeals perfectly to children. Walt Disney was an almost unmatched genius when it came to presenting enlightening entertainment to children.  I cannot imagine the world of animation without this film.3 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Probably the best animated feature in existence.", "It hardly requires yet another amateur opinion to bolster the claim that *Pinocchio* is probably the greatest film ever made by Walt Disney. Some have quibbled about the catch-as-catch-can plot (if Geppetto doesn't insist on sending the puppet to school, there would be no movie), or the lack of characterization (even Jiminy Cricket is more of a device than a fully integrated character). But such cavils are blown away by the absolute brilliance of the animation and the pathos of the situations.The early sequence in Geppetto's workshop, with the multitudinous, individualized cuckoo clocks (biergarten ladies in quaint caps, quacking ducks, an annoyed little wooden mom spanking her brat, and on and on -- all of them wheeling in and out of their respective clock portals) immediately sets the highest standard of what the art-form can accomplish. It is a symphony of pure delight. Another insightful reviewer here at IMDb beat me to the punch when he/she discussed the revolutionary achievement during the Monstro sequences. For the first time, physical scale is integrated within the spatial confines of the animated action: fancy words for basically saying that we never lose track of the immensity of the whale. Pinocchio and his family are insignificant gnats compared to the leviathan; and they remain gnats even during the high-speed sequence when Monstro is furiously intent on their destruction. The animation is as disciplined as it is revolutionary.It also may be a little too baroque for very young children. Parents, beware: a 3- to 4-year-old will likely be frightened by the whale scenes (that whale is really full of hate), to say nothing of the hallucinatory \"Pleasure Island\" sequence in its entirety. The misery-index is disturbingly high after the bad boys start turning into jackasses. The frightening score is emphatic; the suffering is not ameliorated. Indeed, as far as Walt is apparently concerned, these boys get exactly what they deserve, and they are shipped off to the circus or the salt mines . . . FOREVER. They are not rescued. Walt was never above using terror to drive home a moral. Be a good boy . . . or else. Let it also be noted that Honest John the Fox, his feline accomplice, and the scary Coachman (the most frankly evil character in the entire Disney canon) go unpunished. The world is a dark and dangerous place, so you had better let your conscience be your guide, pal.But the movie's darkness is easy to overstate. The virtues of family life provide a haven against the wolves snarling at the door. And in aesthetic terms, one has to merely witness the loving care that is lavished upon, for example, Figaro the kitten -- the thoroughly realistic bodily movement, the jealous but adoring feline temperament -- to come away from *Pinocchio* with the assurance that Life's dark underbelly will not hold sway with artists intent on bringing joy to our children.9 stars out of 10."], ["Perfect in every way", "Pinocchio scared me a bit when I was a kid.

After the surprise success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) Disney was hoping for another movie that would be just as well received financially and critically, just like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (international gloss of $6.5 million against a $1.49 million budget) so Pinocchio had the daunting task of following in the footsteps of what many then and now called the mother of animated feature films but also turn a profit as the world falls into the madness of World War 2. Needless to say while Pinocchio was a moderate critical success that the time and was massive box office bomb with Disney getting only $1 million against a $2.289 million dollars. Time has been kind to Pinocchio however with it gradually getting it's money back and earned critical acclaim with a 100% like on Rotten Tomatoes ( a grade shared by Mary Poppins which would come out in 1964) does it deserve this much love and admiration? Well.....yes. Yes it does.The story of Pinocchio is much in the same vain as its predecessor, a simple story with good morals and characters. Geppetto (Christian Rub)is a toy maker living in what I can assume is mid to late 1800s France, he is lonely and dreams of a child of his own. One night he wishes upon a star and as result the magical Blue Fairy (Evelyn Venable) brings Geppetto's most recent puppet to life. Now Pinocchio (Dikie Jones) has to prove to the Blue Fairy that he is truthful, honest and unselfish in order to become a real boy. To help Pinocchio achieve this goal a cricket called Jiminy Cricket becomes his conscience a sort of guide through the real world.The main star of Pinocchio is the animation and artwork; the backgrounds are lush and highly detailed. They add to the magical atmosphere and make you warm and fuzzy as a result. The animation itself is typical late 1930s-early 1940s smooth and fantastically animated with tons of visual personality. Such as how Honest John (Walter Catlett) reads the school book upside down tells us that he is stupid and overconfident, Geppetto's cat is another example of this. The cat never said a word yet I feel I know everything about him. Another thing about the animation is the physical and visual comedy which is perfectly timed and thought out; my example I gave with Honest John is genuinely funny and is delivered with some nuance, all the jokes are delivered with subtlety and respect for the viewers intelligence, something a lot of children's movies throughout the years since Disney's creation have struggled to understand and have suffered as a result.It would be unfair of me to talk about the performances, they are all flawless and Dikie Jones deserves special mention as he is totally believable as Pinocchio, considering that Dikie Jones was only 11 years old at the time of playing the part. I cannot find anything wrong with his performance or any of the other actors.Pinocchio, much like Snow White has its morals told in simple but smart ways that both children and adults can relate to on some level. I do not need to explain why Please Island and the children turning into Donkey's are not only memorable and intelligent in delivering its message. The film is also not afraid to go to some dark places, the kids transforming into donkeys and the Ringmaster are only a few moments where the movie gets really dark and almost disturbing especially for a family friendly movie. However this is not a negative for the movie, the dark moments shine the happier moments all the brighter. In fact I cannot find any flaws in this film, this movie is almost perfect.Pinocchio is one of the best animated films out there, a classic that has stood the test of time. At times harrowing other times whimsical Pinocchio is an artistic marvel with themes and messages that will last forever."], ["Excellent Disney classic!", "Everyone knows about this one! I remember watching this classic as a child on VHS tape at my grandparents all the time. I'm surprised I didn't completely wear that tape out! It's so easy to know why this film is still beloved today by audiences. It's just so well made on every level and wildly entertaining. First of all, the animation is incredible and if you buy this on Blu Ray today then it still holds up pretty well. The characters are interesting and written with great depth. Pinocchio, Geppetto, and Jiminey Cricket are all great characters that the audience comes to care deeply about. You follow Pinnochio on his journey of becoming human and learning what it means to be honest in life. It teaches great important lessons about honesty and other good values, so that makes it extra suitable for families to view. The story is entertaining, adventurous at many times. Pinocchio getting lured and placed with a group of other boys and promised great things, which leads ultimately to very negative consequences. All the time this is going on, Geppetto never stops looking for his son Pinocchio. I 100% suggest this wonderfully made fun Disney classic. 10/10!2 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Wishes Come True", "I've said it before and I'll say it again: I am a sucker for classic Walt Disney movies. At 59 years of age with no grandchildren I still make a point of adding the releases of classic Disney animated films to my collection. I never grow tired of watching them and they still retain the magic for me that they had when I viewed them decades ago as a child. I enjoy them with great nieces and nephews when I have the chance, exposing them to the magic that is Disney. They might find the animation lacking in a world of computer generated images but there is no mistaking that these films are works of art.So it is with the release of PINOCCHIO: THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION EDITION on blu-ray. Yes, it has been released previously but as with all Disney re-releases new features have been added and each time they attempt to offer the cleanest and brightest picture possible. They never fail.For those unaware of the story being told (where have you been to miss this?) it tells of a lonely marionette maker named Gepetto whose latest creation is a young boy he names Pinocchio. During the night a fairy arrives at his shop and brings the boy to life, placing a cricket named Jiminy in charge of watching over him, to be his conscience. Gepetto rises delighted to find him alive. But Pinocchio doesn't want to be just a marionette. He wants to be a real live boy.This goal sets Pinocchio and by association Jiminy on a set of adventures while Pinocchio tries to become that. As a young and uninformed person Pinocchio falls prey to the perils of life, kidnapped at one point and setting off to join a group of other young boys who want to grow up into a terror filled journey that finds some of them turned into burros. All the while Jiminy continues to warm Pinocchio of the dangers he is about to encounter but his warning seem to fall on deaf ears.Pinocchio's quest is a noble one. He loves his \"father\" Gepetto and wishes to become a real boy to be normal but also because he wants to please Gepetto. The bond between the two is as much parent to child as could be found. And before the story ends both will place themselves in danger because of the bond they have.Watching this movie again after all these years it continues to hold up to the test of time. That was one of the most magical things about the classic Disney movies. They were not rooted in one decade or another 60 years later. The stories were timeless and always offered a bit of common sense guidance not determined by social mores of the time but based on things everyone should know and learn. It isn't about political correctness or a cause but about life in general and that's why they remain some of the best films around. In a year where we have all been pounded with politics it is wonderful to see a movie not mired in that but that offers a compelling story that teaches as well.As I said earlier the movie itself is a masterwork of art, with images that were drawn by some of the best and brightest that Disney ever had working for him. Their ability to bring to life this story and to make it interesting is amazing. And it isn't just the characters that make it so but the backgrounds, the settings and the attention to detail that make this film one that is a visual feast for the eyes. To just imagine the work that went into a single minute of film is stunning. To realize that the movie contains 88 minutes of that is astounding.In addition to the remastered look of the film there are several new bonus items included as well. One is a reworking of the now famous tune from the film \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" as done by 3 Disney kids. Another is a behind the scenes making of on the film. A third is a behind the scenes look at items discussed for the Pleasure Island sequence that were abandoned and not used. There is a discussion with Walt Disney about the character of Pinocchio and the making of the movie. And there is a short cartoon featuring Oswald the lucky rabbit, one of the earliest creations of young animator Walt Disney. Not enough? Well there are indeed more extras to be found.In addition to that the movie is available in a packaging that includes both the blu-ray and DVD versions on disc as well as a digital download for the film making it as portable as you possibly can right now. If you aren't aware of digital downloads of films then by all means you need to begin looking into Vudu and ultra violet editions. This movie would be a great place to start.When all is said and done PINOCCHIO remains the treasure that it was the first time you saw it. If you have children then don't let this on pass you by. Normally Disney releases a film and then removes it from the market for several years. So pick this one up before that happens because by the time it comes around again your child might think themselves too \"grown up\" for a Disney flick. Have it on hand so they can enjoy it now. But don't let them know that you're enjoying it more than they are. Let it provide family memories now like it did for you when you were young.

Snow White was absolutely fabulous and deserves its place in history as the first feature length cartoon. But one sees after a couple of minutes into Pinocchio that the Disney animators were hungry for more. This is a movie that tries to reach for something more and greater. It succeeds. The opening scene contains some of the most heart warming and magical moments ever animated. And then the glorious scene as the camera pans through town and children head off to school (it must have taken them months to do those 2 minutes!). And then the movie gets dark real fast as Pinocchio gets conned and manipulated by frankly evil characters. But the story is so simple and so easy for us as an audience to relate to (what child has never wanted to be a \"good\" one and somehow wandered off and gotten into real trouble) that we take it in. This movie makes you FEEL. The sweet scenes make you giddy with joy and the creepy scenes are truly frightening. Parents, this is a good kids movie, but you simply MUST watch it with them to ask them how they are doing or hold them through the scarier scenes. Well worth it to share the moment with them. And the animation is second to none. In this age of computer animation, I was astounded at how much detail and movement was packed into these old oil based paintings, how smooth they were animated, and how fluid they were. No detail is missed. No cost is spared to bring this story to life. \"Thank you once again, Mr. Disney!\""], ["Quality song, quality synopsis, simply the best Disney movie (and of course version) ever!", "The 2nd animated feature to have been made by Walt Disney, Pinocchio is based on the novel of the same name by Carlo Collodi. Set in Italy, the Pinocchio in question is a marionette created by Gepetto and metamorphosed by the Blue Fairy after Gepetto's wish. Guided by a talking cricket, Jiminy Cricket', the puppet must learn the rights and wrongs and prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish in order for Gepetto's wish to become entirely true. Although Snow White & The 7 Dwarfs marked Disney's introduction to feature movies, Pinocchio, it's follower, is arguably the best film Disney has ever produced! The film is darker than most cartoons and will freak out every child who watches it. The scene where Strombolli, the greedy puppet expert, kidnaps Pinocchio is bad-ass and the magical Pleasure Island will touch more nerves, because it demonstrates that making a jackass out of yourself will make you feel worse. The whole work of art warns children, well any viewer, never to accept advice from strangers. Examples are shown by the foxy Honest John and his feline sidekick Gideon. Another enchanting element about Pinocchio are the representations. Being a fox, Honest John is a symbol to slyness (eat ya heart out Kubes!); Pinocchio is convinced that John is telling the truths, but is he? The location; Pleasure Island is a murkier version of Neverland. It's holiday reps allow the boys to behave badly, but the boys somehow make jackasses of themselves. Monstro, a monstrous sperm whale, could easily be compared with monster movie characters i.e. Godzilla, the Incredible Hulk and Bruce the shark. Pinocchio uses a superb voice cast; one of the actors being the famous ukulele player Cliff Edwards, who voices Jiminy Cricket and deservedly won an Oscar for the best original song 'When You Wish Upon A Star', simply the best song in the world! It apparently was an anthem for World War 2 and the lyrics depict a dream coming true, part of the subject matter. The film also had an Oscar for the best original score, and an excellently written one too, because the music creates the atmosphere, in particular, during the haunting Pleasure Island scene.

Carved from a piece of pine by a woodcarver named Geppetto in a small Italian village, he was created as a wooden puppet, but dreamt of becoming a real boy. The name Pinocchio is Italian for \"Pine eyes\".Pinocchio is known for having a long nose that becomes longer when he is under stress (chapter 3), especially while telling a lie. His clothes are made of flowered paper, his shoes are made of wood and his hat is made of bread (page 16 of Collodi's Le Avventure di Pinocchio). Geppetto gave him the name Pinocchio because it is an Italian Name of good fortune.Pinocchio made into a cartoon film: In 1940, the story of Pinocchio was made into a full length animated film by Walt Disney. The second film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, it was made after the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 7, 1940.The plot of the film involves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio (voice of Dickie Jones) being brought to life by a blue fairy (Evelyn Venable), who tells him he can become a real boy if he proves himself \"brave, truthful, and unselfish\". Thus begin the puppet's adventures to become a real boy, which involve many encounters with a host of unsavory characters.The film was adapted by Aurelius Battaglia, William Cottrell, Otto Englander, Erdman Penner, Joseph Sabo, Ted Sears, and Webb Smith from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske, and the film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts.Pinocchio won two Academy Awards, one for Best Original Score and one for Best Original Song for the song \"When You Wish Upon a Star\".Plot: Jiminy Cricket walked into the workshop of the woodworker Mister Geppetto to warm himself from the cold, and watches as Geppetto finishes work on a puppet he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a falling star that Pinocchio could be a real boy. During the night, the Blue Fairy visits the workshop to grant Geppetto's wish and brings Pinocchio to life, though he is still a puppet. The fairy tells Pinocchio that if he wants to become a real boy of flesh and blood he must prove himself to be brave, truthful and unselfish and able to tell right from wrong by listening to his conscience. Pinocchio doesn't understand what a conscience is, and Jiminy appears to explain it to him. The Blue Fairy asks if Jiminy would serve as Pinocchio's conscience, a task he accepts.Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. The next day, he sends Pinocchio on his first day of school. However, Pinocchio is led astray by the conniving Honest John and Gideon, who convince him to join Stromboli's puppet show instead. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction, but when Pinocchio offers to come back in the morning, Stromboli locks Pinocchio in a birdcage to stop him leaving. With the help of the Blue Fairy and Jiminy, Pinocchio escapes.Unfortunately, on his way back to Geppetto's house, Pinocchio is once again led astray by Honest John and Gideon, who convince him to go to Pleasure Island. On his way he befriends Lampwick, a misbehaved and destructive boy. Soon Pinocchio and the other boys begin to enjoy gambling, smoking, getting drunk and destroying Pleasure Island, much to Jiminy's dismay. Then Jiminy discovers the island has a curse that transforms boys who \"make jackasses of themselves\" into real donkeys, who are then sold to work in the salt mines and circuses as part of an evil racket run by The Coachman. Lampwick is soon transformed into a donkey, but Pinocchio manages to escape with a donkey's ears and tail.Upon returning home, they find the workshop empty and soon learn from a letter by the Blue Fairy that Geppetto, while venturing out to sea to rescue Pinocchio from Pleasure Island, had been swallowed by a giant whale named Monstro. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the bottom of the ocean, with Jiminy accompanying him. However, Pinocchio is soon found and eaten by Monstro, where he is reunited with Geppetto and his pets inside the whale. Pinocchio devises an escape plan by burning wood in order to make Monstro sneeze. The plan works, but the enraged whale gives chase. Eventually, Pinocchio succeeds in getting Geppetto to safety in a cave under a cliff before Monstro rams into it, but Pinocchio dies in the process. As Geppetto, Jiminy and the pets mourn the loss, the Blue Fairy decides that Pinocchio has proved himself unselfish and thus fulfills her promise to turn him into a real boy, bringing him back to life, much to the delight of Geppetto and Jiminy.In conclusion 10/10 points: a masterpiece of animation and to be enjoyed any time of the day and in all seasons.Email me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for movie recommendations."], ["Early Disney magic.", "This is one of the fist feature length Disney animated movies and after all those years it also still is among one of the most classic and adorable ones.\"Pinocchio\" is a real adorable movie to watch, mostly due to its likable characters. Basically every character within this movie is a great and classic one. I especially really liked the truly adorable little kitten Figaro. But of course also the Pinocchio character himself is a real classic and one of the most adorable ones ever created by Disney. I mean, whenever you hear the name Pinocchio you immediately think about the Disney Pinocchio don't you? But besides Pinocchio also Jiminy Cricket and Geppetto have grown into becoming some real classic characters.The movie its first halve is mostly fun and cheerful and features some nice comical moments as well. The second halve of the movie is more dark of tone and a bit more serous, though the movie luckily never looses its sense of fun and entertainment.I never really have been a too big fan of the movie its second halve. Probably because its too dark and serious of tone. Especially the movie its final part with Monstro doesn't really feel quite consistent with the rest of the movie. The first halve is mostly light and fun and enjoyable as you would expected from a Disney movie. But then again all earliest Disney movies have some more heavy and serious elements in it. Just look at the first ever long Disney animated movie \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" which was actually quite dark at the times and even a bit horror like. Same also goes for \"Pinocchio\". In all honesty, as weird as it might sound, but no way Disney would make an animated movie such as this one again. It's simply too scary and serious in parts.It's quite strange but the entire story in general actually doesn't connect well. I mean right the next day after Pinnochio had been brought to life by the Blue Fairy, Geppetto sends him to school and the movie is filled with story elements like that. The story often makes some very sudden leaps and there actually is very little interaction between Pinocchio and his 'father' Geppetto. Yet there relationship and basically everything else within this movie works out so well. It's simply Disney magic and these 'old' Disney movies just basically can do no wrong for me.Perhaps the only problem I have with these 'old' early Disney movies is its voice cast. While watching this movie again lately I couldn't help wondering of the movie actually wouldn't had been a better one if it had used some more well known actors to provide the movie its characters with their voices. It's probably because 'voice-actor' wasn't a real profession yet at the time and cartoons were not something credible enough to lend your voice to that the early Disney movies often use some unknown actors. It really sounds as if they were simply picked off the street and I truly feel that some big acting names could had brought the movie to an even higher level.The animations, as always, look good and it actually is impressive to watch these 'old' Disney animated then the newer ones, knowing how basic this movies got made, without the help of computers and anything like that. It's some real authentic craftsmanship and it also in no way looks outdated now days.It's also an early Disney movie to feature more than a couple of songs in it, though they are actually only present in the movie its first halve. The songs are all quite nice, of which 'When You Wish Upon A Star', performed by Cliff Edwards, is of course the most classic and memorable one.A real early Disney classic and still perfectly watchable to everyone, after all those years.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"], ["A deeper, more earnest animation from Disney.", "Made just before the start of WWII, this feature finds us in the capable hands of \"Jiminy Cricket\" as he narrates us through this tale of \"Geppetto\" - an old carpenter who lives his life vicariously through his creations. The \"Blue Fairy\" visits the old man one night and gives life to one of his creations \"Pinocchio\" - with \"Jiminy\" being given his conscience... All is going well until he has to go to school; en route to where he is waylaid by a foxy character who entices him with tales of success on the stage. Needless to say, nothing goes to plan and he embarks on a series of adventures that put him, \"Jiminy\" and his father in considerable peril. This is a much more complex storyline than you might expect; there is plenty of joy and fun, but also a darkness that provides food for thought for children and parents alike. The wonderful, Oscar winning, score is the best in the Disney repertoire and the characterisations are engaging. If it has any flaws: the dialogue - there is too much of it; it is possibly just a little too long and finally - I just didn't really like \"Pinocchio\" much as a little boy - a bit too thoughtless and selfish.

If you love every minute of Pinocchio with an equal passion (just as I love every minute of Snow White), I envy you.But as for me, stimulatingly colorful as I find the Monstro sequence, it is not an episode that I care to put through my projector five times a day. Once or twice a month is quite sufficient to whet my enthusiasm. The same goes for most of the early stuff with Geppetto too - though these are given added liveliness by dance and song. Even Pleasure Island starts to soften after a while (though familiarity will never dull the venom of The Coachman as animated by Vladimir Tytla and voiced with a Cockney accent by Charles Judels) and there have been days when I have felt - etched in such extraordinarily stark detail though the animation is - satiated by Stromboli.However, I can never get enough of Jiminy Cricket solo or J. Worthington Foulfellow paired with Gideon. (Figaro is a ceaseless source of joy too, though he is more difficult to isolate). My favorite sequence of course is the second. The rest of the film is full of wonder and enchantment, of marvelous technical effects and animation wizardry, of color and humor, of sly throwaways (\"What does an actor need with a con\u00acscience anyway?\"), and sets of incredibly detailed imaginativeness, but they do not top Jack Kinney's astoundingly inventive episode which Walter Catlett brings so buoyantly to life.Kinney has constructed his whole sequence like a short cartoon. After a spectacular establishing shot of the whole town and some initial funny business with Pinocchio and Geppetto (which also cleverly provides us with needed background information), we are deftly introduced to the delightfully fruity Foulfellow and his comic companion. The action is brilliantly paced with episodes of fast and more furious slap\u00acstick interspersed with glib puns and such droll verbal humor as Honest John's vain attempt to spell Pinocchio. When John begins his famous song extolling the joys of the actor's life, Kinney's camera soars to the roof tops - a device that enables him to playfully contrast this birds' eye-view with the bizarre low angles of Jiminy Cricket. Rapid editing joined to a sophisticated, jaunty music score so further enhance these scenes they can be played over and over with no loss of expectation and enjoyment.All in all, Pinocchio is a treasure of moods and surprises, of quick-witted fun and even a little satire, of feline exasperation and crotchety humor (\"I wonder what time it is?\"), of the grotesquely amusing and the bizarrely droll, of silvery suspense and out-and-out terror. The wealth of detail in the craftsmanship and impeccable polish of the effects were never to be excelled and rarely equaled.\nWith overwhelming justification, many critics consider Pinocchio not only Walt Disney's masterpiece but the high point of cinematic animation. I don't dispute the second proposition - and if I didn't love Snow White so mightily I would certainly agree to the first!Pinocchio represents Disney at his weirdest (the movie is most definitely not suitable for young children), but also at his most inventive."], ["After many years, it still SHINES !", "It has been ages since I watched Pinocchio.

And thus seeing fairly hood reviews of this I decided to give it a chance. And I guess it wasn't a dull choice. But nor did it make my passion of entertaining me fulfill.Coming to the story, it is as fantasy as other Disney movies. Disney movies are mostly consisting of fantasy themes and with a moralistic message. And this wasn't different. I liked the theme, message behind it and how the characters played their part as well. But still, I'll not say this was the best film by Disney. There was some kind of overload. Story was dragged a bit in the second half. It became slow and felt like I should stop watching it. Although characters ain't boring either and that led me to finish movie successfully. A tale where a Cricket's life is going to be changed by a single wish - a wish granted by other, for the other and through the other medium. And what follows next is fun to watch.Again, a Disney movie which seems for the minor age group of people that was a shocker, by letting the minds of older people attract as well. Story which can be related to this day in twenty first century too, is shown so delightfully that any person can have an urge to enjoy for one and a half hours.

While the TV I saw it on did have the volume turned low, I was borderline amused by Lampwick's misfortune, and I wondered out loud if the Coachman and his goons really had an abundance of carts for what was once the Stupid Little Boys to drag. I did appreciate the voice acting (John Worthington Foulfellow's voice was my favorite), and I also appreciated the rather surreal nature of the Ligurian village the film is set in (we have a realistic cat, Figaro, and an anthropomorphic cat, Gideon, as one example), and I could see how creative the writers could get with 5 villains.

(Collodi's real name was Carlo Lorenzini, and he was born in Florence, Italy, in 1826. He used the pen-name \"Collodi\" as that is the name of the little village in Tuscany where his mother was born.)In 1881, Collodi sent to a friend, who edited the \"Giornale per i Bambini\" in Rome, (\"Children's Journal\"), a short episode in the life of a wooden puppet, wondering whether the editor would be interested in publishing this \"bit of foolishness\". The editor did, and the children loved it.In Collodi's original story, Pinocchio gets himself into all sorts of trouble through his spiritual immaturity, but he gradually learns from each lesson, and eventually, after showing noble human traits, is granted the special privilege of being a human.Collodi wanted youngsters to learn that when we are spiritually immature, we are like a puppet, controlled by the immature needs of our ego, which make us do thoughtless, selfish and irresponsible things. But if we keep listening to our conscience, our inner awareness of right and wrong, and keep being guided by that, one day we will become \"a real live boy\", a self-reliant, mature, responsible citizen, no longer controlled by immature needs.Walt Disney, inspired by this wonderful story, and motivated by the same desire as Collodi to teach moral lessons to children through entertaining stories, smoothed the rough edges of several chapters to make a severely abridged version, and turned Pinocchio into one of his legendary cartoons, or as he preferred to call them, \"full-length animated features\".Disney, like Frank Baum and Lewis Carroll before him, had an unusually gifted understanding of the mind of children, knowing exactly what appealed to them, and Pinocchio is a classic example of his powerful insight.In this \"animated feature\" Pinocchio is given the gift of life, but must prove that he is \"brave, truthful, and unselfish\" in order to become a real boy. He is told by his \"father\", the man who carved him out of wood, to go to school and learn to read and write, but instead is tempted by a couple of rogues to join a puppet show. Later when he realises the puppets are slaves to the puppet-master, he manages to escape, only to be tempted once again, to go to \"Pleasure Island\", where everybody makes jackasses of themselves.Narrowly escaping this fate by jumping into the sea, he eventually manages to return home, only to find that his father, on hearing that Pinocchio jumped into the sea, went to sea in a boat to look for him, and was swallowed by the most feared killer whale in the sea, \"Monstro\". Can our well-meaning but wooden-headed hero rescue his father from the belly of the worst monster in existence?

After the success of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs Disney was keen to bring updated version in Animation world and that's how Pinocchio was born. Disney took a simple plot set in Fantasy world where a wooden and living puppet, with the help of a cricket as his conscience, must prove himself worthy to become a real boy. The conflicts in the story are influential to many classic stories over the years because it teaches a lot about morality and being good, brave and unselfish not only to kids but to adults as well. I believe, it becomes easy to understand those thoughts and accept them if it had been told with simple plot. Of course i am saying this because i had to keep mindset of audience in 1940 when complex stories were not being told. Especially in animation world people would have never accepted it so being simple is alternate version of being great for Pinocchio. The script was a Super Hit material already so it all comes to storytelling and Pinochhio hits it out of the park with groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water. The impact of visuals was far better than Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs which clearly indicated that Disney has achieved something of next level. Musicals are good enough compared to the musicals of some feature film of that time (take The Wizard Of Oz for instance). The only problem i found in the film was that it has so many fantasies in its fantasy world that cannot be practical at all (well, it was warned in the beginning itself but still multiple layers of fiction snitches away the conviction in some parts). Creative team and presenters of Pinocchio took an ordinary script to higher level than it deserved. Now coming the best part of the film, it doesn't matter how much visually spectacular Pinocchio is, the biggest lesson and timeless manis lies in the the moral values taught by the film. It is just not about other animated flicks but i have seen many feature films using the same formula again and again from Pinocchio. There is a reason why this film is still being remade after 8 decades. All said is enough i guess, Pinocchio is that Must see Fairy tale which provides entertainment for sure but more importantly it tells a lot about real life temptations.

Indeed, there's a real darkness to this seemingly light fable. Whether it's the sight of our hero trapped in a cage as a stereotypical puppeteer threatens him with violence, a sequence in which the innocent young lead is lead to his doom with an insidious song and dance routine, or the downright Cronenbergian body-horror that occurs in the tobacco-fuelled nightmare that is 'pleasure island', there's some really rather disturbing stuff here. Of course, this is a children's movie, so it isn't exactly graphic. However, its themes are mature and its villains don't see the repercussions usually associated with family fare. Obviously, this isn't an issue if you're old enough not to be bothered by it. It arguably makes for a more engaging story as it adds some real stakes. The major problem with the piece is its structure, which feels very episodic and almost a tad repetitive. The overall pacing isn't too bad because the narrative unfolds in a relatively breezy way, but it's just that the plot ends up feeling rather stop/start and, even, ever-so-slightly incohesive. In the end, this is an enjoyable animation. It also attempts to instil a good set of morals into its audience, often in a rather heavy-handed way. It's not the best film Disney have ever produced but it holds up well. 7/10"], ["This Early Dose of Disney Magic is Beautiful, if Scattered", "Disney's second big-time animated feature looks markedly better than Snow White, no small feat, but otherwise falls a little bit short of meeting that first film's high standard. When You Wish Upon a Star notwithstanding, the songs aren't as memorable, the foil isn't as well-defined and the plot is less focused. Which isn't to trash the whole effort - it's still an incredibly charming, timeless creative success - just maybe a slight letdown in some crucial areas.Pinocchio himself is as inherently innocent as they come, it's an essential part of his character, but that leads him into a lot of easily-avoided trouble. Somewhat frustrating to watch, as he fails to learn from countless mistakes and warnings, but it could be argued that's childhood in a nutshell. The mythical \"get out of jail free\" card he carries, an extremely forgiving (and slightly unnerving) fairy, bails him out of nearly every jam, anyway, so the greater dangers ultimately feel rather toothless.The story skips around a lot, bouncing from a jolly family home to a rowdy stage show, a risqu\u00e9 island of naughty indulgence (and puzzling transformation) to the cramped confines of a whale's belly. That gives the visual crew ample opportunity to flex, but also feels excessive and disjointed. More like a series of one-off episodes than a single, cohesive story, at least until the third act. There's also a team of anthropomorphic cats carousing about, causing trouble, which is odd given the otherwise all-human population, and undercuts the fundamental strangeness of a wooden puppet come to life.Disney's wand still has plenty of magic - Pinocchio is a constant visual delight - but in this case, it would benefit from a longer attention span."], ["Pinocchio will continue to become a great legacy for all time.", "A classical entertaining masterpiece with great morals, fun characters, fun songs, dark elements."], ["...did I see the same movie?", "Pinocchio is hailed as one of the greatest animated movies of all time. Everyone rants and raves about how amazing it is. But I sat down to watch it again and liked it even less than when I was a kid (this is coming from someone who likes other Disney films more now, at age 20, than as a kid). Why? I honestly don't understand why everyone says this is Disney's best work.I admit, for its day and even for now, the animation is superb. I only saw one or two flaws in the whole movie and they were pretty easy to miss. But as nice as it all looks, the continuity was pretty bad. There's a scene in which Jiminy Cricket hangs his coat and hat on a peg. Next shot, it's gone. We see Pinocchio with the hat and coat a few seconds later but they literally disappear off the peg. There's also a scene in which one of the characters is singing and his mouth literally doesn't move at all. And it's pretty dang obvious.The music is good too. I don't have any complaints about it. It has solid music that's cute and charming and it's all good. So that's one thing the movie did well.But the story... Hoo boy. First off, the story is a confusing mess. There's no real storyline weaving throughout unless you count Pinocchio's attempts to be a real boy. How does this lead him all over the place? It doesn't. The story of his attempts to be a real boy are scrapped during scenes that don't make a whole lot of sense to begin with. It is never explained how and why bad boys become donkeys (unless you count Jiminy Cricket's line about how they're acting like jackasses). It is also never explained what happens to them when they become donkeys. Are they sold somewhere? Who's the guy rounding them up? And wouldn't parents get worried if a huge crowd of little boys randomly disappear periodically? Why are the talking ones discarded? They're still donkeys. They can still be sold. I have so many questions about that scene. It just doesn't make ANY sense.And then they return to the house to find that Pinocchio's father has been swallowed by a whale while he was looking for Pinocchio. Okay so the father was so stupid he actually went into the water looking for his wooden son or the whale jumped out of the water and swallowed him. Also, who left the note for them? Someone who saw it? How did they get the birds to deliver it? Was it Giselle from Enchanted sending her doves with a message again? And then there's the whale. So whales are vicious carnivores now? I admit I could be wrong but that whale looked like one of the ones known for only eating krill. And then there was the fire. So they make the whale sneeze by burning it from the inside? How does that make sense?? Smoke doesn't make you sneeze.And those are just a few of my examples of why this movie is far from the best Disney movie ever made. It's not bad but it's certainly not good. It's adequate. Entertaining but nothing special. It looks nice but there really isn't anything beneath the surface. So yeah I'd recommend it to Disney fans. But I think I'll leave the title of \"best animated movie\" to The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (if only because it features the introduction of characters that are now more popular than Mickey Mouse and friends... and it's my favorite too).

BUT...The moment Pinocchio goes into the ocean my 6-year old brain said: \"Now wait a minute... how can he breath under water?!\" I literally held my breath and was glued to the screen. And then all of a sudden one of the most shocking experiences of my life appeared ! Indeed, Monstro the whale. I read people talking about the transformation as being one of the most scary scenes, well I watched that without any problem as I recall, but the sudden appearance of the whale has shocked me tremendously. It was so bad that my dad had to carry me out of the movie theater. I am not kidding whatsoever when I say that this scene has been haunting me for several years.

The plot isn't bad, and told fine. The character gallery is reasonable. The acting is somewhat mixed in quality. The sound is decent, same goes for music.

The use of Jackasses is heavily critical to demonstrate the foul use of the substance on children.The use of the evil characters makes them all financially greedy and self involved which is fine to convey the evilness against the goodness but the fact that Pinocchio follows in their footsteps initially adds extra dreaming and controversy to the young wooden boy's persona and this character development is extraordinarily dependent on the wishes of a fairy, with the timing a tend to convenient.Pinocchio, a boy made from wood, is ultimately destined to be a real boy if he obeys the rules and his acts of selfishness and inappropriate desires end up giving Jiminy Cricket a case of the blues as he ponders his usefulness. Pinocchio is a selfish character undeniably wound up in his new existence that spells disaster for those around him.And this is fantastic. Nothing represents our modern youthful stereotypes more than self involvement and given the eventual conclusion in the whale and the unforgettable nose growing sequence this demonstrates a time when animation pushed the rules right to the edge and with a carefully woven music score this is what animation should be.

They are all turning into Donkeys and you end the movie right there and then? :("], ["Pinocchio (1940 Disney) was a \"message movie\" for adults as well as children", "Pinocchio (1940 Disney) starring Dickie Jones, Cliff Edwards, Walter Catlett, and Frankie Darro (voiceover talent for major cartoon characters in the movie) is a satisfying, simple, well done movie set in the Swiss Italian mountains of northern Italy, and is based on an Italian folk tale by \"Collodi.\" It was Walt Disney's second feature length cartoon following the epic success of Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937 Disney), which made more money than any in movie history up to that time (and this was the Golden Age Of Big Studio Hollywood) and which lit the fire under the MGM studios to create The Wizard Of Oz (1939 MGM) starring Judy Garland to cash in on the same unexpected and spectacular success Disney's Snow White movie had achieved.Pinocchio (1940 Disney) was a simpler movie, not set in a grand palace or peopled by elegant royalty or ending with a final reward for the main character of being taken by Prince Charming to a golden castle in the sky with celestial choirs grandly singing \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" punctuated by sonorous wedding bells. The audience is not expected to cheer for victorious and righteous royalty at the conclusion of Pinocchio (1940 Disney).It's a story about a lonely bachelor artist and craftsman, Gepetto, who makes toys and entertaining clocks which \"perform\" mechanically.Gepetto creates a marionette type puppet in the shape of a little boy, and wishes in his prayers the boy would come alive and become real, thus making Gepetto a father. After he prays and goes to sleep, his home is visited by \"The Blue Fairy\" who grants half of Geppetto's wish as a reward for the old man's goodness and kindness. The puppet comes alive, but is still made of wood, and will only achieve status as a \"real boy\" (i.e. a human boy with real flesh and bones) if the puppet earns that by doing good things, and listening to his conscience. A visiting cricket named \"Jiminey\" is recruited for the job, and after Gepetto awakens and learns to his joy that Pinocchio has come alive, the puppet goes out into the world where he must make good by doing good, and in the end, after several set backs, does that. He rescues his puppet maker father from a giant whale named \"Monstro.\"The movie ends happily with no departure from the happy old man's small home which celebrates the end of his loneliness, and the arrival of human company in his life. Jiminey Cricket ends the movie (the incredible, lilting, haunting voice of \"Ukelele Ike\" Cliff Edwards, the voice of \"Jiminey Cricket\") with the simple song \"When You Wish Upon A Star\" and a final portrait of the lovely star lit night time sky casting it's friendly light over the small Swiss Italian village. A simple, beautiful end to a great movie.Before the main character, Pinocchio, achieves success, he has two set backs. Both are set in the world of entertainment.He becomes a success as an actor, a star. But Pinocchio's actor success is not rewarded. Instead, his producer, Stromboli, locks the new actor star in a bird cage, and Pinocchio becomes a miserable prisoner beholding to the big money bosses who profit from his work (a realistic comment on the reality of show business.)The entire movie is great entertainment, often touching, and filled with worthwhile and humane messages about the human condition, it's follies, and it's ultimate (at times) nobility.Pinocchio (1940 Disney) is a wonderful movie worth screening often, as great in a proletarian way as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937 Disney) was great at portraying the world of story book royals, both good and bad.--------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

Mainly Because older ones are based on fairy tales your grandparents grew up with, adapted for a younger generation. but Pinocchio, no matter what generation you're from, is certainly an awesome film.I said it once before and i'll say it again. Disney will never approve of a film like this ever again. why? first of all, let's talk about the 3 references to the word \"Jackass.\" nowadays, it means those guys from MTV doing stupid stuff, but back in 1940, jackass was another word for donkey. of course thanks to soccer moms and censors, the word \"Ass\" is now considered a verbal offence. and if soccer moms hear verbal offence in a movie, they're not going to let their kids watch...which means no money in Disney's bank account.what about the bad boys and the pleasure island scene...that scene still makes me shiver with fear, but in a good way. just imagine all the children who watched those poor little boys become donkeys, never to see their mommies again, and used for slaves. it made you never, ever want to be bad. but of course, if children were scared, they didn't want to see the film, and their parents didn't make them...which means no money in Disney's bank account.Sensing a pattern here? Cut to nearly 70 years later. as long as Disney keeps pumping out Hannah Montana, disregarding any moral in their movies, but keeping it within \"Family fun\" limits, then they have what matters to them most...Ka-Ching.OK, enough about that.Pinocchio isn't a boy...yet. he's a man-made creation by a poor puppet-maker named Gepetto. The only thing that isn't on Gepetto's mind is money (sorry, had to throw that in there.) but rather, seeing the joy on children's faces when they see all the toys he spent time working on. his only wish is that his new creation, Pinocchio, a wooden puppet, comes to life so he can have a son (i guess all the women didn't want to marry a man who made toys, just so he could see little children playing with them.) so The blue fairy flies out of the sky, perhaps from Alfea (hey, if Pinocchio and Winx club come from the same country, i can put them together, right?) and brings Pinocchio to life. but the only way he can become a real boy, is if he is good, with the help of one of the greatest Disney characters of all time, Jiminey cricket. but along the way, he deals with a sly fox named \"honest John\" a cruel puppeteer named Stromboli, and then monstro, possibly the most awesome, excellent, Disney villain good old Walt could come up with.Bottom line, you have to watch this movie. why? because kids who watch this film are good. they don't want their noses growing, or to become firewood, or a donkey. if you want good kids, show them this.10/10"], ["A Worthy Follow-Up", "Well right off the bat, Pinocchio was never near the top of the list of my favorite animated films. And now that I am sitting down really thinking about it, I can't figure out why. The songs are good enough, the animation is really great, and it's overall a very intriguing story. Still, something is missing, and now that I am going into my second childhood and reliving the princess years, maybe that was it: no princess. No girl at all, really, except for the elusive Blue Fairy. But since it's not really relevant, I guess I'll just have to leave that oversight out of the critique.So first off: the music. Really, the only songs worth listening to are the ones Jiminy Cricket sings, but man are they whammers! The Disney banner song When You Wish Upon a Star makes its debut here and is very lovely indeed when sung by Cliff Edwards.It's really impressive how much the animation improved since Snow White in only 3 years. Visually, Pinocchio is a lot of fun and quite beautiful, even when pushing 70 (whaaat!?).And yeah, the story is pretty good too. The whole Pinocchio being a complete idiot thing can be kind of grating, but I am grateful it's been massively toned down from the original where he was just plain spiteful and you wanted to beat the sucker. And Pleasure Island... can you say terrifying? I mean, that scene still scares the ever-loving mess out of me. I give complete credit to Pinocchio for the most night-mare inducing film in animated cinema.So all in all, yeah Pinocchio has all the elements of a good film. But this one in particular seems so geared towards children, little boys in particular, that there is not as much for adults to appreciate, unless they are into getting completely creeped out by evil donkey-magic. I'll bring it out when kids come around without protest, but as for myself: I'll stick with the princesses!Quote of the film: They never come back as BOYS!"], ["Many thank you's Walt! :)", "Genre: Disney cartoon film with an alive wooden puppet and a talking cricket wearing clothes. Also has a bit of cruelty in it.My thoughts: I have an affinity with this film. I feel I am a lot like Jiminy Cricket. I am clumsy and talk to myself, for example. If I were bad, I think I would be like Honest John, sly but not quite as sly as I could be and also a bit of a liar. I think I would have a tiny bit of the same jealousy as Figaro shows towards Pinocchio. Someday I may have the same talent as Geppetto. If I had smoke in my mouth I would feel the same anger as Monstro (in a way).I love this beautiful film. There are still others I prefer and the cruelty bothers me a bit, but I still love it!Recommended to: People who like Disneys, people who like the song \"When You Wish Upon A Star\" and people who like simple, yet lovely animation. Enjoy! :)What happens: A little cricket named Jiminy, stays the night in a woodcutter's cottage, in a quiet, peaceful town in Italy. In the cottage, the woodcutter, Geopetto, makes a beautiful wooden puppet named Pinocchio.

Except for the scenes with Stromboli (voice of Charles Judels) and two other scenes, this was a good movie. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching and funny Disney classic about special friendships for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it.

There are moments in this film that are nearly breathtaking in their visual beauty, the most memorable of all the one when Gepetto is lovingly crafting his wooden puppet and making him dance to a wonderful film score.These early animated films seem surprisingly dark and trippy now, much more so now that Disney movies exist primarily to drive money-spinning product franchises.

And of course the songs.  This film has great songs that carry the story along.  \"An Actor's Life for Me\" is my favorite.One might wish the monstrous Dogfish that swallows Pinocchio in the book had not been changed to a whale in the movie, but (unlike the major changes the Disney people made in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\") this change is not great enough to quibble about.Over all, Disney's \"Pinocchio\" is Carlo Collodi's \"Pinocchio.\"  I loved both the movie and the book when I was a child, and I still do.1 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Walt Disney's Masterpiece as told by this Great critic", "\"When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who youare, anything you heart desires will come to you.\"You've heard this song on the Disneyland and Superbowl commercials, but do you remember where it came from?It came from this cartoon, Pinocchio, Walt Disney's second feature to \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in 1940.I repeat 1940!!

Geppeto gets his wish when the Blue Fairy brings Pinocchio to life!!!It took nearly 700 animators and technicians to bring Pinocchio to life and the hard work definitely shows!!!People can say whatever they want about Disney current movies, true they lack a certain magic unlike their cherish cartoon like Pinocchio, but Disney is one of a few companies that has a SOLID record of making Cartoon Classics that are loved by everyone.The fairy brings Pinocchio to life and promises to Pinoccho (voice of Dickie Jones) that he will remain a real boy if he follows the basic principles that every boy should have.He has to be loyal, truthful and above fair. She assigns Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Edwards) to be Pinocchio's conscience.Well it sounds easy at first, but living up to these values is the real challenge here and Pinocchio tries his best to follow them,but since he has just being turned into a boy he doesnt yet know right from wrong.This is where we meet characters like ,J. Worthington Foulfellow, Stromboli and Barker who take advantage of the young boy.Jiminy Cricket and the fairy save Pinocchio from his judgement calls ,but yet Pinocchio doesnt learn to tell the truth and when he lies his nose starts to grow like a Christmas tree. :-)Meanwhile Geppeto is looking for Pinocchio and ends up being captured by a giant whale Monstro!!!Pinocchio saves Geppeto in a brillian animation sequence and Pinocchio by displaying bravery ends up being a real boy permanently.It's a classic, I can say more but I dont want to spoil it for anyoneIn an age, where moral, brilliant, wholesome cartoons are scarce you look back to the classics and Pinocchio will forever stand out as one of the greatest classics ever made by Walt Disney who has left his print in the world and in children's hearts.Go out and buy this for youre children"], ["The Crown Jewel next to \"The Little Mermaid\"?

I also don't get why it's \"one of the most celebrated animated movies of all time\", I mean the film was a flop when it was initially released, very much unlike \"The Little Mermaid\". People complain that Disney always sugar coats their movies taken from stories but no one complains about this one.

The 'hero' is extremely unlikeable. The situations Pinocchio ends up in are borderline terrifying (both for a child, and for an adult who can think through the deeper implications of kidnapping/slavery). Those who are evil in the movie don't end up punished, they simply seem to get away with it. Most of the songs are not enjoyable. The drinking and smoking don't bother me, personally, although they are shown in a very positive light at first (\"Look kids, on Pleasure Island, you can do whatever you want, and that means you can finally get that cigar and whiskey you've always been craving!\").The Good:I believe this is supposed to be viewed as a morality tale \u2013 like Aesop's Fables \u2013 and as such this movie defies several \"normal\" Disney conventions. For example, it appears that bad behavior (such as telling lies or being selfish) is the true villain. And, like any morality tale, it is meant as a lesson. Granted, the moral of the story is a good one (dealing with bravery, truthfulness, and selflessness along with the idea of not trusting strangers) although it comes across as very heavy-handed. The song \"When you wish upon a star\" is extremely lovely and timeless.The Mom view:I can admire this movie's unique story, but I don't find it in any way appropriate for young children. As a parent, I find Geppetto, to be the most sympathetic character and one who should be the true hero of the story, despite his lack of screen-time.

But, it was 1940, so I'll give it a break. What I find most endearing is the fact that there are no drunken psychedelic sequences (you really can't count Pinoke's pool hall antics) and nothing to unduly confuse, bore or alienate children.Its pacing is probably its' strongest point. Not too fast, not too slow. I first saw this movie when I was 8 years old and a poster child for Ritalin, and it kept my attention perfectly. 9 years later, watching it again, I'm awed by its nice, leisurely story. It's perfect, because you don't want it to end, yet it doesn't hang too long on irrelevant plot points.About the closest it comes to dragging is the beginning in Geppetto's shop, where the old man is so psyched about his puppet. still, it's great Disney, the likes of which you wouldn't see again for several years."], ["One of the very rare Disney movies I don't like", "I love a lot of Disney films.

While it's somewhat better than 'Cinderella,' 'Dumbo' and probably 'Sleeping Beauty,' it's not quite as good as the other films I mentioned due to its sluggish pace throughout but it has a lot of moments that made me laugh, some memorable scenes and some catchy music.Besides the pace, the drawbacks include Pinocchio's mouth not moving when he talks once or twice, the cats Figaro (quadrupedal) and Gideon (bipedal) not talking if Honest John can (it would probably have made sense if all these animals could speak), some loose ends and the song 'Little Wooden Head' seeming to be incomplete because the version on the UK VHS of 'Sing- Along-Songs: Colours of the Wind' had additional lyrics but it's a chirpy song nonetheless. While 'Give a Little Whistle,' 'Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee,' and 'I've Got No Strings' are all cheerful, the brief ending version of 'When You Wish Upon A Star' made me a little teary- eyed ('Baby Mine' from 'Dumbo' made me cry even more) but the opening version strangely didn't make me cry and I found it beautiful - I also liked how it became Disney's signature tune in various arrangements when accompanying several different logos, including the more recent river and Disney castle opening logo. The incidental music has a melodic, nostalgic feel to it and I liked how some of it matched the tunes of some of the songs and the character animation. Moving on to the animation it was smooth for the most part and the backgrounds were intricately drawn. The Blue Fairy in particular was gorgeously animated and I liked her pretty glittery effect. She reminded me of typical 'Glamour Girls' from the 1940s. All of Gepetto's clocks were imaginative if the animation on them was jerky - the ones with the ducks and the drunken man made my mum and I giggle but she found the one with the woman smacking her child's bottom for being naughty with paint politically incorrect because corporal punishment again children is frowned upon these days as is childhood smoking since these things were more appropriate in bygone days. This film had more of an emotional impact on me when I was little because not only did 'When You Wish Upon a Star' make me cry but also the Blue Fairy turning Pinocchio into a real boy. That part just makes me smile these days. There are also some very dark moments in the film such as Stromboli locking Pinocchio in a birdcage, the naughty boys on Pleasure Island turning into donkeys and the climax with Monstro the whale. The underwater scene leading up to this is just as beautiful as the Blue Fairy and is vibrantly coloured.Overall this Disney film is an enchanting watch that has some funny moments, stunning animation and memorable songs in spite of its pace dragging on throughout. 9/10."], ["Strictly for kids!", "Its one thing to have a wooden puppet suddenly become alive, but another entirely for Guipetto to expect him to go to school and actually learn something.

It proofs this is exclusively aimed at a very young demographic who wouldn't bother questioning these silly actions.I don't remember the classic story of Pinocchio being THIS stupid.

I love movies that are just totally bizarre and weird, but this movie isn't surreal enough for me to enjoy it in that way. It also has way too much filler. Also, the cricket is really annoying. All he does is provide narration of things that are onscreen. Children aren't so stupid that they need to be told that there are things in front of them. Or maybe they were back in 1940? Either way, he is annoying and for the most part unnecessary.In the end I don't have much to say about this movie. Its just a series of filler and nonsense.

I do appreciate how dark this is at times, though.Still entertaining enough, it's one that is more than worth your time.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["CLASSIC.", "A Collodi's fairy story with the magical Disney twist.

My only lasting memory over the years was that Pinocchio's nose would grow longer if he told a lie. Other than that the story was fresh to me. Pinocchio was animated, could speak, but was still a wooden boy. Only if he did something unselfish and heroic could he be turned into a real boy that his puppet maker father wanted. It happens near the end when he has to make a daring rescue from a large whale in the ocean.The great Mel Blanc provided many of the voices but to me the main one is Cliff Edwards who voiced Jiminy Cricket and who sings the iconic \"When You Wish Upon A Star\", the whole impetus for this story."], ["Sweet, fun movie - an exemplary Disney film", "Jiminy Cricket finds himself at the home of Geppetto, a simple carpenter and toy-maker.

I guess that Disney intended the movie as a morality tale.Some other things:*Stromboli is a volcano off the coast of Sicily. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about Ingrid Bergman and basically said that he wanted to get slinky with her on Stromboli. Billy Bragg put the song to music.*I see that Mel Blanc did Gideon's hiccups, making this one of his rare contributions to Disney. He was already providing voices for the Looney Tunes, and soon after got signed exclusively to Warner Bros.*The nose-growing scene enabled me to reference Nixon (with whom Walt Disney was big buddies).*The treatment of gambling as a moral vice no longer applies since gambling has become an important part of the economy.*Italy looks really idealistic in the movie, but Mussolini's brutal occupation of Libya and Ethiopia calls that into question.The point is, Disney's \"Pinocchio\" is a product of its time. An enjoyably weird version of the story is the 1975 Soviet movie \"Adventures of Buratino\", based on \"The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino\", Aleksey N. Tolstoy's retelling of the story. Even though the movie got made under Brezhnev's stagnation, it's basically Pinocchio meets \"The Partridge Family\". Seriously, it's one of those movies that makes you think \"What am I watching?\" Equally kooky were \"About Little Red Riding Hood\" (in which Little Red Riding Hood acts demented) and \"Mary Poppins, Goodbye\" (yes, there was actually a Soviet version of \"Mary Poppins\").Anyway, we can accept this movie for what it is."], ["Puppet Master: Disney Edition", "First we have the good things. Compared to the other hits Disney already had (such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) this was an interesting choice of a story to adapt. From what I've heard, and not actually reading the novel, its quite a dark book almost even sadistic. And yet the movie pulls off a lot of the dark tone with say the part where all the boys get turned into donkeys on Pleasure Island. We never see them saved or rescued in anyway which leaves an unsettling feeling about what's going to happen to them. Geppetto's character to me was done quite well. You can feel how lonely the old man is and how much you want his wish to come true. He has energy, laughs, and I think he deserved more screen time. Also I must say that the animation for the Blue Fairy looks amazing. Its done in an older type style and looks much less cartoonish. And this brings me to the bad stuff. The rest of the animation is okay usual Disney standard, but after seeing the wonderful work done on the Blue Fairy it makes me wish the whole movie was done in this style. Next, Jiminy Cricket isn't that great of a role model, he warns against temptation but the only reason he's Pinocchio's conscience is because of temptation. Although he does sing a great song that shaped the image of Disney for years to come, and won an Oscar for Best Song, \"When You Wish Upon A Star\". Lastly, I just found the character design for Pinocchio a bit boring in my opinion. Overall I found watching it again after all this time, for what the story was it wasn't bad.

There must be eight: one for each of the seven segments, and an eighth for the film as a whole - for, varied though the seven segments are, they undeniably belong together. And, alas, space does not permit me to lay out all eight verdicts.  I shall have to confine myself to details representative of the whole.  At any rate, I shall try.We learn the modus operandi of \"Fantasia\", the linking theme, in the second segment - an abridged version of Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker\" suite. (Missing are the overture and the march.)  Tchaikovsky's ballet involves anthropomorphising inanimate things, plus the odd tiny animal.  So does Disney's \"Nutcracker\".  But Disney has thrown out the particular details. The Chinese Dance is danced by mushrooms (who look, but are not, Chinese); the Arabian Dance by \"Arabian\" goldfish; the Russian dance by \"Russian\" thistles and orchids.  Sometimes it goes further: \"Waltz of the Flowers\" shows two entire changes of seasons, with leaves, fairies, seed pods, seeds, snowflakes - everything but flowers.  But in ignoring the letter of the instructions Disney is perfectly true to the spirit.  Indeed he is more true to the spirit than the original ballet - for, let's face it: stage ballet is a degenerate and over-formalised art, which makes some of the world's most exciting music dull as wallpaper.  Disney's amazing images express Tchaikovsky's sense of motion more than earthbound dancers ever could. This, one feels, is the kind of thing ballet music was TRULY designed for. The same goes to a lesser extent for the other two pieces of ballet music on the program.This basic device - ignoring explicit instructions, but remaining true to the spirit - is carried through into every segment.  (Some segments are better than others, but none can be called a failure.)  Dukas's \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" has been turned into a Mickey Mouse cartoon - but it's the best Mickey Mouse cartoon ever made; and we realise that the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice is really the archetype that all of the best Mickey Mouse cartoons had been  reaching towards, all along.  The Pastoral Symphony adheres to Beethoven's program but moves everything from the woods of Central Europe to a dreamland from classical mythology.  (The second movement - the section with the courting centaurs - is a failure.  For once the spirit as well as the letter of Beethoven is ignored.  Unfortunately some critics cannot see beyond this movement to the superb interpretations that flank it on either side.)I doubt that so much genuine creative work has gone into a film, before or since - even if you don't count the contributions made by the composers. What's my favourite film?  I really don't know.  But if you tell me that I must sit in a large dark cinema for two hours; and ask me what I would like to occupy my eyes and ears over those two hours, I would answer, without hesitation, Fantasia."], ["A Truly Unique Experience", "This is one of the truly rare, one of a kind movie going experiences, kind of in the same league as watching 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  I like to watch this film repeatedly;  often times I'll just close my eyes and daydream, letting my own imagination go in place of whats on the screen.  My favorite part is the opening sequence, with its dramatic music and free flowing imagery foreshadowing the state of the world in 1940.  The end of Ave Maria is the perfect bookend to this masterpiece; death has withdrawn and peace has finally arrived.  It would, but not for another five years and millions of lives.

All but a couple of the sequences are quite enjoyable, and some especially so. Even the segments that don't work as well are usually at least interesting, since you can at least appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.You don't really have to be all that familiar with the specific pieces of music for it to be worthwhile, since in several cases they chose to match the music with material that is rather different in nature from any original context that it may have had. And in any case, the animated sequences are intended to provide the context, in terms of the movie.No doubt, everyone will have his or her own favorite segments, based on the music itself and on the choice of accompanying visual material. The \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" sequence, with Mickey Mouse, is certainly one of the most memorable. The adaptation of \"The Rite of Spring\" is quite imaginative in using an entirely different setting for the music. \"Night on Bald Mountain\" has striking and sometimes bizarre visuals.Many of the classic Disney features still hold up well as family entertainment, but \"Fantasia\" is unique for its combination of imaginative concept and visual creativity. Not every minute of it works, but that's the price of being willing to experiment.

This is so unique, because unlike a typical Disney movie, in this movie we do not hear any dialog from the characters, and all of the music is instrumental (except for \"Ave Maria\" at the end). The film is divided into eight sequences, each of them being introduced by a guy named Deems Taylor, who was a very well-known music critique.The eight segments are as follows:1.) \"Tocatta & Fugue in D-minor\" composed by Johanne Sebastian Bach. This segment consists of shots of the Philadelphia Orchestra and their conductor Leopold Stokowski with a lot of cool shadow and color effects during the first three minutes, then we see a lot of shapes and random objects that Taylor would suggest to us might pop into our brains when listening to the music.2.) \"The Nutcracker Suite\" composed by Tchaikovsky. In this part of the movie, we listen to excerpts of the famous ballet suite, and we see various fairies, flowers, fish and other nature-related creatures.3.) Everyone's favorite \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" starring Sorcerer Mickey and Yen Sid (the sorcerer whose name is \"Disney\" spelled backwards). This is also the only segment to be seen again in this film's sequel, \"Fantasia/2000\" 60 years later, and in it the apprentice brings to life a magical broomstick to try to fill a cauldron with water, and the spell goes wrong so the apprentice gets reprimanded. This is then followed by Mickey greeting conductor Stokowski.4.) \"Rite of Spring\" composed by Igor Stravinsky. This segment takes place billions and billions of years ago with the coming of the dinosaurs, where we see the creation of Earth in the beginning of time, and are later introduced to all of the different dinosaurs including the tyrannosaurus rex, which become extinct in the end of the segment.5.) \"Intermission/Meet the Soundtrack\". At this point in the film, Deems Taylor introduces this string thingamajigger called the \"Soundtrack\" that he asks to make a lot of sounds resembling various instrument sounds.6.) \"Pastoral Symphony No. 6\" composed by Beethoven. This segment is about a day in the countryside, and in it we see a lot of Greek mythology creatures like unicorns, satyrs, centaurs and centaurettes, cupids, Bacchus, Zeus, Iris, Apollo and Diana.7.) \"Dance of the Hours\". This is where we see dancing ostriches, alligators, elephants and hippos. Each part of the piece suggests different hours of the day, and it all ends with a triumphant finale where the dancing hippo takes center stage.8.) A combination of two pieces that are utterly different in mood and tone. They are \"Night on Bald Mountain\" in which a bat villain named Chernabog has Satan's evil spirits dance furiously until the coming of the sacred dawn, and then Franz Schubert's \"Ave Maria\" which is the one and only part of the whole film in which we hear lyrics sung, and then the movie ends.I simply must say that not only is this film one of my all time favorite animated masterpieces, but it is also an example of a big highlight of the 1940's in cinematic history, all because of the ways it is so unique and special. In addition to this masterpiece, I also think \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Gone with the Wind\", \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Casablanca\" are main icons of cinematic successes. I definitely think this should have been the first animated movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award instead of \"Beauty and the Beast\"."], ["The Mousetro's greatest achievement. Fantasia WILL amaze ya. (Possible SPOILERS.)", "Fantasia is the most amazing animated movie I have ever seen. It may not have the humor of Finding Nemo, nor the simple message of Dumbo. It's so different from anything else the House of Mouse ever created. But it may well be the best.It's a collection of short subjects with little or no plot, but what makes the compilation unique is that it's all matched to classical music, beautifully conducted by Leopold Stokowski, and bridged by live-action footage of the silhouettes of an orchestra, narrated by Deems Taylor. Besides these sequences, there isn't a word of dialog.Toccata and Fugue in D Minor: This is nothing but an abstract piece of animation. You see the strings of the cello, the violin, and lots of stripes and shapes that leave trails of color in their wake. Magnificently matched to the music. There's not really that much to explain, just images.The Nutcracker Suite: An ode to nature based on Tchaikowsky's six dances. Each dance is performed by the most unlikely dancers. Fairies, goldfish, thistles and many more perform the dances, but best of all is Art Babbit's Chinese Dance sequence, with mushrooms. The highlight of the sequence is Hob Low, a little mushroom who seems to lag behind the rest of the impeccable act. Brilliantly animated by Babbit, one of the best sequences in the movie.The Sorcerer's Apprentice: An old story starring Mickey Mouse and the intimidating wizard Yen Sid (guess what that spells backwards!), matched to Dukas' symphony. This is without a doubt MM's greatest performance. The animation, especially Ugo O'Dorsi's brilliant effects, is impeccable. Funny and dramatic at the same time, everyone who's ever heard of Mickey Mouse should see The Sorcerer's Apprentice.The Rite of Spring: Igor Stravinsky's Le Sacre was originally meant to signify prehistory, but Disney has taken it much further than a series of old tribal dances. The Rite of Spring starts out at the dawn of the planet, zooming in on our tormented home, spewing lava and rocks. Powerful scenes of the elements that ran amok, without utilizing computers at all (well, they hadn't been invented yet). Then, we skip to the beginnings of life, from the life and death struggle of big bacterium vs. little bacterium. Skip to the dinosaurs, and the constant tyranny of the tyrannosaurus. Many powerful dramatic scenes, beautifully set to the music, until desertification, starvation, a tidal wave and an earthquake wipes out the dinosaurs. Marvelous. One of the best shorts in animation history.The Pastoral Symphony: Ludwig Van Beethoven's masterpiece, instead of portraying the countryside, takes place in a mythological setting. From Pegasus' family, and the adventures of the little black Baby Pegasus. Next movement revolves around the attempts of a bunch of butt-naked baby cupids trying to bring together single centaurs and centaurettes. Next, the exploits of the amorous and extremely drunk Bacchus and Jacchus, who join in the centaurs' wine-making. But all is interrupted by Zeus, who chucks lightning bolts at the lot till he's bored. Next movement, and order is restored, the sun sets, and Diana fires a comet into the sky. Wonderfully animated, and perfectly matched to great music.The Dance of the Hours: Ostriches, elephants, hippos and alligators dance to Ponchielli's ballet, in a nobleman's castle, revolving around the leader of the gators, Ben Ali Gator's crush on Hyacinth Hippo. Beautifully animated, wonderful comic relief amidst a storm of serious art. It would've been just as successful as a short cartoon. Hilarious!A Night On Bald Mountain and Ave Maria: One word: Chernabog. You have to see it to believe it. IS Bald Mountain REALLY a mountain? No, it's the crouching figure of Chernabog, a demon who calls all manner of grotesque, undead, and demonic things to himself, and tortures them in a hellish manner, disposing of them at will. Absolutely terrifying cacodemonic animation coupled with Moussorgsky's dramatic, intimidating score. But as dawn approaches, torch-bearing pilgrims, and Schubert's Ave Maria in the background, subdue Chernabog and the demons, and they return to the Underworld as a masterpiece ends. Vladimir Tytla is the only man who could possible have pulled off this dramatic, spell bindingly horrific sequence. The best piece of animation ever.Fantasia is something special. Music, comedy, and unadulterated evil. That's a strange mixture. But two hours of these elements come together to make what may be the best movie ever.

Unfortunately, it was too much too soon. People went in expecting children's entertainment - after all, that's what Disney was known for - and instead were treated to high art. Nothing wrong with that, but you need to expect it first. And thus, Fantasia flopped financially, and what was meant to be a continuing series of films, remained just one until the turn of the century.But oh what a film it is. Music by the best classical composers ever lived, performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, hosted by Deems Taylor, featuring some the finest animated segments Disney had ever done. It's a stone cold classic, was from the very first moment, and it's a shame it didn't do so well. Luckily it has gone down in history as one of Disney's finest and will be watched and appreciated for centuries to come.As for the individual segments, they're not of equal quality, though they are all very good in their own ways.The opening segment, Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, is not one of my personal favourites, but it works as a good opening intro to the idea behind Fantasia and is pretty to look at in its own way. It hasn't aged as well as some of the other segments, but it does its job more than adequately.Nutcracker Suite, on the other hand, is fantastic. Beautiful images, perfectly accompanied by one of the most recognizable pieces of music there is. After seeing this segment once, it's hard not to see fairies and seasons dancing around whenever you hear the piece.And then there's The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Everyone knows this one and has most probably seen it, even if they haven't seen the whole film. It's the segment with the most story and is one of the strongest Mickey Mouse shorts ever made. Grandeur, funny and even a bit threatening, it's probably the film's strongest moment.Rite of Spring is another one with a story, this time about the history of our small blue orb floating in the space. It's intriguing to watch, but once again the animation shows a bit of its age and it's perhaps even a little bit too ambitious for its running length. Not the strongest segment, but once again very good nonetheless.The Pastoral Symphony and Dance of the Hours, the next two segment, are to me very similar and while they're both fine, I cannot admit to liking them all that much. They're mostly just general gallivanting and while that's fine and fits the music, it can become a bit boring. The Pastoral Symphony is also the segments that has aged the least gracefully with some really rough character designs.Luckily we have Night on Bald Mountain and Awe Maria to close the film. And they are awe-inspiring. The devil on his lone mountain top is one of the scariest images Disney has ever produced and the rest of the segment is equally haunting, eerie and threatening. Which is why the following tranquility and quietness of Awe Maria works so well and allows you to drift over the finish line with a smile on your face and peace in your heart.Fantasia is not a perfect film, but it's still one of the finest pieces of art I've ever seen and a perfect introduction to animated films meant for adults. As a child I found it slightly boring. As an adult I'm in awe."], ["Legendary Visual Realization of a Series of Classical Favorites", "Movies affect viewers in different ways. Sometimes they can be enjoyed for their plots, characters, settings or other aspects of the mise-en- scene; but they can also be appreciated subliminally, appealing to our imagination, whether conscious or unconscious. FANTASIA is one of the best - if not THE best - example of this process at work. The film's visual beauty is stunning - a testament to the labors of the thousands of animators who worked on the project. The variety of visual styles is equally breathtaking, from the story of evolution recounted to the accompaniment of Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring,\" to the comic ballet performed by ostriches, hippopotamuses, elephants and alligators (Ponchielii's \"Dance of the Hours\"), and the devilish revel abruptly interrupted by the coming of a new day (Mussorgsky's \"Night on a Bare Mountain\" and Schubert's \"Ave Maria\"). Yet Disney was no high-flown idealist; he wanted his work to be accessible to mass audiences. Hence these elemental sequences are juxtaposed alongside simpler stories, such as \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" in which Mickey Mouse learns the error of his ways. The action doesn't take itself too seriously: while Dennis Taylor's narrative introductions are both concise and informative, he is shot against the background of members of the Philadelphia Orchestra taking a break from their labors. While they have an important task - to ensure the music carries the narrative - they also need respite. FANTASIA is the kind of work that befits repeated viewings in order to encompass is range of visual as well as technical wizardry. Every viewer will interpret the sequences differently, which is precisely the point in any work like this."], ["Fantasia!", "This is one of the most fantastic animated features of all time in My opinion! Being a huge fan of movie music scores and classical music this is such an extraordinary movie to watch and enjoy. My favorite pieces in the film is the Nutcracker Suite, Rite of Spring, and Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria. These are three of the greatest pieces of music ever written in My opinion! The animation is crisp, clean, and clear! In fact, this animation is arguably better then today and there hasn't been any animation like the Night on Bald Mountain since in my opinion! Disney did a fabulous achievement here! So if you love Disney, the new fantasia 2000 animated feature, animated films in general, movie scores, and classical music then I strongly recommend that you head over to Amazon.com today and purchase this great animated movie today!28 out of 45 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["For Back Then!!!!!!", "Why is this film so incredible? If for no other reason, consider it is the year 1940!! Things like: Special effects, synthesized sound which interacted with animated motion, and color enhanced collage authentications, are things that just sort of roll off the end of our tongues today, but, back then, these techniques were very new to us!! Walt Disney is avant garde in so many uses of cartoon perfection!! In 1931, he came out with the first color cartoon. In 1937, the film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was a landmark in animated entertainment...\"Fantasia\" is absolutely one the best films ever made!! The color, the music, and the correlation between reality and illusionary depictions, culminated a brilliant montage of spectacular amusement for the movie audience!! My favorite segments were: Nutcracker Suite / The Russian Dance, Pastoral Symphony / Beethoven, and last but not least, Sorcerer's Apprentice / With Mickey Mouse. My mother said that I laughed hysterically for three hours in the movie theater at that scene with the multiplying brooms in the Sorcerer's Apprentice segment!! This film is synonymous with Christmas, as synonymous with Christmas as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" The movie \"Fantasia\" is considered one of the greatest films ever made, I wholeheartedly agree, in my book, it ranks 12th best movie ever!! \"Fantasia\" is usually in AFI's list of top 100 films ever made!! Imagery and the succinct use of color graphics are second nature with technical film artists today, back then, however, it was a revolutionary concept which dazzled the moviegoer!!! Walt Disney films are not just \"cartoons\" they are computerized digital artistry which evoke a rare art form of paramount escapism on the silver screen!! The \"Fantasia 2000\" movie was excellent too, but merely a rendition of the classic, while the segments were different, there just was not as much originality to them!! As a result, it lost a little panache in the process!! As a Chicagoan, I should like the \"Fantasia 2000\" more in one area: The music was performed by the Chicago Symphony!! In the original, the music was done by the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra!! \"Fantasia\" is a rare treat that every movie aficionado should witness.. I definitely recommend seeing this movie, preferably around Christmas!!"], ["Classic animation", "I've recently bought the Silly Symphonies DVD. My daughter Sarah and I have watched one cartoon every day, culminating in Fantasia. We didn't watch it all at once, but spread it over the course of a week (I tend to agree with other comments - it's too much for kids in one viewing). She sat on my lap and loved every minute of it, even 'Night on Bald Mountain'. I must admit I hadn't watched it for years and forgot about this section, but she wasn't scared by it. This is surprising when you consider the spider in 'Mother Goose Melodies' frightened her!In my opinion Fantasia is the ultimate Silly Symphony. It's obvious all the groundwork for the film came from them, which is why it's so good - the artists had ten years to hone and perfect their skills while Walt Disney had the vision to realise it. I wonder if he had thought of it a decade earlier and waited until the right moment to create it...? It's a real shame he never lived to see its success because he deserved to.It's hard to find the right words to surmise this film; I suppose I could break each section down and give my opinion as others have done, but as a whole - well, it's got good bits and bad bits; happy and sad bits, it's scary and funny and gloomy and sunny. It's spirited, colourful, sparkling, animated... but let's not get carried away here. It's only a film and some bits of it are quite boring.If you randomly wound through it you could find yourself watching any one of the above, and this to me sums it up - it's unique. What other film can you say that about?Fantasia is a light that will shine for generations to come. 9/10."], ["A human Movie", "2017 is a year of technical marvel. Looking at movies of today, we see massive, stunning works of animation. We can now achieve computer generated images that look nearly indistinguishable from reality, and at the forefront of movie making today is Disney. Through Marvel, Disney creates multiple action packed superhero blockbusters a year. Star Wars, after it's 2015 revival, has new movies being released annually. Pixar, after creating several successful franchises, is now resting on its laurels, creating sequels like Finding Dory, Toy Story 4, Cars 3 and Incredibles 2. Even Disney's in house animation team is finding success, bringing back the Disney princess formula with movies like Frozen and Moana. However, amidst all this success, we have lost the truly human touch. Fantasia perfectly captures all that was lost in today's Disney movies. The movie has a very personal and human feel to every aspect of it. The orchestra, a very tangible presence in the movie, feels alive. They laugh, play their own little tunes during the intermission, but most importantly, they make mistakes. The animation is the same way, It's very rough at times and sometimes lacking, with some animations being reused, however every shot is filled with passion. You can tell that people worked on this, people with ambition, though they were not perfect. In modern movies, this beautiful animation that looks so real lacks the touch of individualism that Fantasia has in spades. The scene of the Sorcerer's apprentice dancing around the broom is burned into our collective memory for a reason. In all its flaws, its rough edges, it feels real to us. We can see all the raw effort and energy that the animator's put into each of Mickey's footsteps and that resonates with us. Fantasia speaks to the viewer not because it's perfect, but because it's flawed."], ["The secret of Walt Disney: we saw him as the ultimate Sorcerer, he saw himself as the eternal Apprentice...", "After \"Snow White\", who could ever underestimate animation? The new art form was definitely there to stay, embarking with bold confidence in the VIP wagon of Hollywood and promising to throne over the box-office for the decades to come. To think that it all started with a mouse!And Walt Disney movies all pay tribute to that aspect of his success, that the simplest things can lead to the most extraordinary achievements, all it takes is to believe in\u0085 or to wish upon a star. \"Fantasia\" is also an allegory of Disney's miraculous triumphs, an extraordinary achievement that also started with a mouse, THE mouse actually.After years of declining popularity, it was time for Mickey to make a glorious come-back in a 'Silly Symphonies' cartoon, one of Oscar-caliber fitting his legacy. It was \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" adapted from Goethe's story of the same name. Today, the vision of Mickey enchanting the broom, making it fetch the water with Paul Lukas' playful tune and the dream sequence over the cliff, where he controls stars, comets, waves and the whole universe, are some of the most iconic moments of Disney's canon and American film-making history. And unconscious or not, there was something self-referential in that short.Indeed, Disney was like Mickey during the dream, he could make anything possible with that magical hat called a 'vision', and like Mickey realizing the mayhem caused by the hundreds of brooms flooding the whole place, he saw the budget leak the short could have caused and things going easily out of control if he didn't decide to enlarge the scope and ambitions of the project. Instead of a short masterpiece, how about one big masterpiece made of little ones? So he made \"Fantasia\", an animated anthology, made of eight unforgettable segments set up to classical music pieces, each one having as much to say about music as they have about life.From the enchanting 'Dance of the Plum Fairy' with Tchaikovsky's 'Nutcracker' and the adorable 'China dance' with the mushrooms, to the horrifying Mussgorsky's 'Night on a Bald Mountain' and penetrating Schubert's 'Ave Maria', from the poetic to the droll, the antique to the modern, Disney took the world to a journey of such an unprecedented narrative it couldn't match the usual seventy minute-format. The two-hour run-time, long even by today's standards, says something about his urge to reach the mature age of animation. \"Snow White\" and \"Pinocchio\" were landmarks but the general perception of animation as an entertainment for children was a barrier to cross. \"Fantasia\" did it, showing with frames whatever classical music communicated with notes.It is perhaps the greatest tribute to the power of music ever made in animation, an odyssey in the universal and timeless meaning of the word that can be easily compared to Stanley Kubrick's \"2001\". And watching the silhouette of the conductor Leopold Stokowski during the \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" by Johann Sebastian Bach has the same impact than the 'Zarathustra' opening, an ominous moment of religious intensity, and with a point: music doesn't set the tone, doesn't get us in the mood, it IS the mood, the tone, the focal point. The purpose of the opening sequence, as explained by the Master of Ceremonies Deems Taylor (who lets us see the Philadelphia orchestra play the instruments) was to acknowledge music's self-sufficient value and not take it for granted. And the film starts with abstract moving forms in gold and blue moving in harmony with the music.We \"visualize\" the sound if that was ever possible. But who said anything was impossible with Disney? In the intermission; Taylor even introduces music as a character! And rightfully so because music also happens to be the storyteller, or a narrator helping us to appreciate our cultural heritage. With Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\", we follow the reign and then the extinction of dinosaurs, what a long way since Gertie in 1914! T-Rex penetrated children's imagination, three generations before Spielberg. Beethoven \"Pastoral Symphony\" is a recollection of little Greek vignettes with fauns, angels and oddly sensual centaurettes. And Ponchielli's catchy \"Dance of the Hour\"s with the hippos, alligators and ostriches is the perfect little interlude before the nightmarish climax and its quiet and peaceful ending, whose religious undertones might make up for the use of evolutionist elements.Without being controversial \"Fantasia\" did break a few grounds of censorship, venturing into themes hardly explored by movies such as details of female anatomy or depictions of Satan. Maybe Disney was too ahead of his time and some critics judged the film a bit too pretentious, too uneven, which can be argued since some parts are definitely standout masterpieces while the \"Dance of the Hours\" is of 'Silly Symphonies' level, but the point is that Disney, like I said before, was the sorcerer's apprentice whose delusions of grandeur were reflected by Mickey's dream, he wanted to push the edge of the envelope and experiment the newest framing and stereophonic sounds. Maybe what the film says is that any director must be a sorcerer's apprentice.And there is something in the criticism faced by \"Fantasia\" that reminds of \"2001\" with people praising Mickey's part like they acknowledge Hal 9000 was the best thing about the film, as if they were afraid to admit they were bored a little. But how many movies owed their ticket to posterity because of some 'boring' parts? Geniuses doesn't just have visions of art, they challenges the viewers' own visions.During the poignant handshake between the two silhouettes of Stokowski and Mickey, like a torch-passing moment between the past and the future, don't get it wrong, there's a third man out there, it's Disney, he's the voice and the Maestro, the one who conducted our eyes, our ears and our hearts to the infinite limits of imagination... and beyond. His secret: we all saw him as the Sorcerer, but he saw himself as the eternal apprentice."], ["Ambition and creativity at its best", "'Fantasia' was created around a beautiful idea. The music inspires the emotions. The emotions inspire the images. And the images go with the music to create a beautiful piece of filmmaking. It not only showed the potential and beauty that could be achieved not just through animation, but through filmmaking as an art form.Each short carries with it a distinct style in animation, with a different director working on each segment. Through this we witness great variations in the style of each short. The likes of 'The Pastoral Symphony' tells the simple story of different mythological creatures going to a party. Then some such as 'The Rite of Spring' segment created a narrative stretching millenia telling the story of the birth of earth to the death of the dinosaurs, earths first dominant species. It captures everything from the majesty of the birth of life to the rage of the T-Rex hunting their prey to create a wide spanning realistic story about the beliefs of the creation of life.Others such as 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' carry no narrative whatsoever. Instead they use only colours and patterns to match the rhythms and emotions of the music. With so many different styles each short is original, creating fantasies unlike anything we'd ever dreamt before.Even the tones of the different pieces differ greatly. Pieces such as 'Dance of the Hours' pack in the laughs with chaotic dancing Hippos and Elephants carrying as majestically as a ballerina. Whilst other sketches such as 'Rite of Spring' focuses on the beauty of the world, with different characters dancing through the seasons of the year.The film embraces many different worlds of magic and beauty, probably the most famous of which being 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'. It showed the kinds of feats that could be achieved through animation, with the likes of a whirlpool and tidal waves being created in vivid and beautiful detail. It's an old story of an apprentice who dreams of power but is unable to control it, put to animation beautifully.But to me Fantasia's strongest feat is its finale, 'Night on Bald Mountain'. Whilst originally removed from some releases due to its controversy in scaring children, the short is one of the most powerful representations of pure evil put to screen. As the devil rises himself and an army of the dead to gain pleasure in watching them suffer. As it goes on we see the chaos reign as the flames engulf all the souls there. Whilst this chaos goes on the devil just sits there maliciously grinning as the suffering goes on.We then get 'Ave Maria' and the daylight scaring the daemon in to retreating back into the mountain. It reminds us of the constant conflict between good and evil, with good winning in the end but evil always being there. Lurking in the darkness and waiting for the next night. It's surprising that one of cinemas most child friendly film makers like Walt Disney helped create such a hellish vision on screen. But just like anything else he has helped make it is a defining film that has inspired film making for many years.And when it comes down to it that's exactly what Fantasia is. Walt Disney bringing animators ambitions and unique styles to the screen. He ensured that we were given a cinematic experience unlike any we'd seen before, bringing many creative worlds to life through the power of the orchestra. It's originality and ambition makes it a cinematic landmark that stands as well today as any other classic Disney and a real testament to the beauty of the golden age of Disney."], ["Now there are three kinds of music on this program \u0085 Fantasia", "Our screening of the original uncut 1940 Roadshow, 35mm Disney Studio Archive Print, (yes, it came from the \"vault\"), of Fantasia was introduced by Disney historian and author John Culhane. He relayed a story about when he spoke with Walt in 1951 and mentioned how great he thought this mix of sound and images was. Walt responded by saying, \"but it hasn't made any money yet\". And that was ten years after its release. He did say that Disney still held strong to his convictions that it was what he needed to make at that time. In 1940, he believed that showing a visceral experience like Fantasia was just what the medium called for; it was the natural evolution of animation in his mind. You have to respect that, no matter how much money he lost after its four-year creation process, employing thousands of animators, it was all about the craft. When you look at the state of the genre today, with about ten films a year from multiple studios, many of them drivel, it is definitely a treat to go back seventy years and see what actual hands drew for the world to see. Frame by frame, note by note, you really can't deny the brilliance of this film, even if you probably will fall asleep at least once each viewing.I remember the first time I had seen Fantasia, I was young and it was one of the few Disney films I had yet to experience. I hated it. It was the most boring thing I'd ever seen. Even when Mickey Mouse finally showed face, with that wizard hat I had seen in so many pictures, I could care less. Truthfully, I might not even have finished it, (when intermission came halfway through, I told my friend that I couldn't even remember what else there was, all my memories had played in Act 1). But I kept thinking about the film each year later. As I grew older and started pursuing a career in the arts, it nagged at me that I didn't appreciate the feat. Then Fantasia 2000 came out and I began to see what I missed in the original so many years before. So, when it was announced that Fantasia was coming to Buffalo's premier theatre Shea's, it was an invite that was tough to pass up.Admittedly, I almost nodded off a few times during the two-hour duration. But that is not meant to detract from the wonder this film instills, not at all. From the narration amongst the Philadelphia Orchestra by Deems Taylor, in partial silhouette, complete with a prologue to each song, (whether they be the kind of music that tells a definite story, the kind that has no specific plot, or that which exists simply for its own sake), to the image of conductor Leopold Stokowski standing alone on his platform, to the animation on screen, working from the music, telling its story, you will be transported to a different world. It is not for everyone\u2014especially little children this day and age with no attention spans, (many parents left with their offspring early on)\u2014but if you're willing to let it wash over you, and enjoy the works of Bach, Tchaikovsky, etc., you won't be disappointed. It's a concert film above all else; you're just watching animation rather than the musicians and their instruments.And you cannot deny the artistry of it all, oftentimes hearkening to future films Disney would be making. You can see the precursors to Tinkerbell in the naked fairies flying around as well as the donkey used that same year in Pinocchio. The abstract illustrations are intriguing, but my favorites are definitely the ones steeped in some biomorphic form. I absolutely love the \"Nutcracker Suite\" vignette, find the \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" to be wonderful, and really get blown away by some of the finale, the combo of \"Night On Bald Mountain\" and \"Ave Maria\". In that final sequence you get to see some amazing artwork in the devilish, winged creature as well as the architectural forms during the \"light\" moments at the end. At times you see frames with immense amounts of gradation and depth, moments where the stark flat colors usually seen, meld into still frames gorgeously painted as though works of art, not something to be seen for a fraction of a second. I'm not sure exactly what causes this, but those freeze-frames are my favorite part of the film.So, is Fantasia a great film? I don't really know how to answer that question. I can appreciate it for what it set out to do, and deem it a complete success in that regard, but would I rather watch it then the likes of Disney classics like Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast, or Robin Hood? No. That said, though, I would recommend it to anyone out there with an open mind and ability to see past the commonplace and mainstream. Some may say you can only truly enjoy your experience if you are on drugs, that the creators themselves were at the time, but that is a disservice. Fantasia is a world that needs to envelop you and become your sole visual focal point for two hours. If you are willing to put in the time, Disney's epic will not lead you astray."], ["Fantastic Fantasia", "1940 saw a new form of entertainment created by Walt Disney, called Fantasia. Renowned musical compositions were played to a group of Disney's best artists, who were instructed to draw their responses to the emotion, expression and narrative that they heard in the music. The result was, in this reviewer's opinion, one of the most iconic moments in film \u2013 these artists redefined creativity and breathed a new lease of life into popular (and perhaps overplayed) scores, forcing us to reconsider what it means to be artistic.A review of six parts would be appropriate in order to celebrate each of the six short films for their own success, however I also feel it is important to consider the effect of the film as a whole.Fantasia grounds itself upon a strong justification for its cause, ensuring throughout that the viewer (whether musically educated or not) understands the purpose of the exercise. The narrator disclaims from the word go that the animations are not absolute stories that will match with the composer's introductions, but instead, are developments from them. Here is where Disney promotes the refreshing method of creativity, which I previously mentioned: the suggestion that interpretation is limitless in possibility, and that each opinion should be celebrated and explored.I feel that Disney's choice of music exemplifies this philosophy to the most obvious and dramatic level. By using scores that are so famous and concrete in their accompanying stories, such as \"The Nutcracker Suite\", he shows how even the most popular music may have a different story to tell. The orchestra are silhouetted to represent the idea that music has become anonymous, and Disney gives a face to the compositions once again: literally re-animating the classics. We are taken on a journey to rediscover the beauty of compositions that we perhaps take for granted. The colourful animations take a flowing, almost hypnotising form within stories that draw upon hidden beats and instruments within textures of the score that make us rethink what we know about the music: we learn to listen rather than to hear. Disney celebrates the intricacies of composition as they were meant to be celebrated, and the creations of the artists approach each movement in every short with appropriate beauty and delicacy.(I would talk about my favourite short here \u2013 Beethoven's \"Pastoral\" \u2013 but once I start I will not be able to stop)!For me, Fantasia represents a redefinition of film in its time as well as a redefinition of what it means to be imaginative across all of the arts. An exercise that had never been tried before, and hasn't since by anybody except Disney, that proves the infinite limits of storytelling. The choices of iconic composition laced together with heart-warming and intelligent animation makes classical music accessible to all ages, and truly shows what it means to be creative: encouraging us to continue rethinking the past and to have our own opinions."], ["Very Good", "I first saw this as a middle schooler in a drive-in theater. It still was impressive.Spoilers among what follows.Fantasia was released with a \"multichannel\" technique called \"Fantasound,\" where one was the orchestral track, and the other was a control track that switched activation between speaker groups.The \"Rite of Spring\" episode was very colorful, but in its dinosaur sequence, even when it was made, the \"dinosaurs\" were mixed together anachronistically. Not that I don't like the visuals, but it's a bit like watching a World War I film with aerial battles with various ragwings, and suddenly a P-51 shows up.Beethoven's Pastorale was probably the prettiest segment, with everything very classical. The centaurettes looked like Malibu Beach girls (well, at least from the waist up) and the males like football jocks. Zeus was very playful, and the thunderstorm sequence was, to me, the highpoint of the episode.The \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" was okay, but it was the only sequence to have a recognizable cartoon character in it. I think it would have been better with another, anonymous, character as the Apprentice.\"Night On Bald Mountain\" was very impressive. However, I learned that the Tchernobog image was rotoscoped, and the person who did the original images was none other than Bela Lugosi. The use of color was especially effective. IMHO, that was the segment that should have been retained for Fantasia 2000.I've seen this dozens of times, and plan to see it many times more."], ["Disney's finest; a true masterpiece!", "This is one of the most unusual films ever produced. It is also one of the most beautiful. Walt Disney took a risk producing this film (it was his third), coming hot on the heals of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, and it was a risk that paid off (albeit several years after the initial release). Made up of several short animated films set to classical music, FANTASIA has many highlights too numerous to mention within the confines of a review. There's Mickey Mouse in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" sure, but there are many more memorable moments: abstract imagery set to Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue\"; the nature ballet set to \"The Nutcracker Suite\" (my personal favorite); \"The Rite of Spring\" depicting the origins of life on Earth; the depiction of good vs. evil in \"Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria\", among others, this film offers something for everyone. FANTASIA is also a showcase for special effects (there are some stunning images in the film), color (the Technicolor is just exquisite, considering this was so early in the days of color film), and sound recording (this was the first film produced in what is known today as stereophonic sound). Although the film failed when it was first released in 1940, FANTASIA is rightfully acclaimed as a classic. I don't think this can be called a movie- it is an experience. One of my theater professors from college once told me of when he was taken to see a reissue by his father when he was young. My professor remembered seeing his father crying, then leaning down to him and whispering: \"This is what we can do with imagination.\" I can't think of a better testament to the sheer beauty of this film than that story. Once you see it, you will never forget it. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10."], ["The movie that I really wish I could make", "It's been almost 70 years since \"Fantasia\" made its premiere on November 13, 1940. It's Walt at his peak, forget \"Snow White\". If you've never heard of this one, it's basically \"The Twilight Zone\" on acid set to classical music.It's also the movie that I really wish I could make. I think the timing's right, but other people might not. The reason is not even worth explaining.An amazing thing about Disney is they have changed a lot since then, and they're not the same anymore. \"Fantasia\" is a damn good movie, and they'll never do anything as good as this again. They ain't even the same Disney that I grew up with and I was born in the early '90s. These days Hollywood just loves to know how much milk they're gonna get out of the cows each and every year. It's so sad to say that most of the time the motion picture is just another way to make money instead of an art form.Art and business shouldn't be two different things. Children should never be patronized or used as a monetary target.\"Fantasia\" is one movie that I wouldn't mind seeing in a theater, especially one that has a huge screen. The timing was anything but right when Walt completed it. I don't think the American moviegoer was mature enough to understand it. That's probably why it almost made Walt bankrupt.What I would have done is I would have shown it in IMAX with its big surround sound system. I would have done it as a mixed-media art film: hand-drawn backgrounds, digital artwork, hand-drawn animation, different kinds of special effects, stop-motion animation on live sets, etc.I'm one of those people that doesn't accept the status quo when it comes to movies. But Hollywood still manages to get it right... when they want to, anyway."], ["A fantastic visual and aural production!", "The 1940 animated classic masterpiece Fantasia was a groundbreaking revolutionary film and has since not been duplicated in this reviewers opinion. In the years since the genre has been littered with many animated features that are musicals, Fantasia was the first last and only animated feature that featured no words and only music. The score that sets the backdrop of the stories in Fantasia is European classical music. The score was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, and was conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The film depicts several different stories as told through music and video. Mickey Mouse Donald Duck, and Daisy Duck are the only famous animated character in the movie, Leopold Stokowski, and Deems Taylor are the only people to appear in the film and they play themselves. Within Fantasia there are several stories, the first of which is \"The sorcerer's apprentice\" this short features Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer's apprentice, the story was an adaptation from Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's poem of the same name. In the Disney version the sorcerers name is \"Yen Sid\" (which is Disney spelled in reverse) is angry at Mickey when he saves him. The next short is \"The Rite of Spring\" is a story about evolution. It starts off in space in the Milky Way and zooms in to Earth, which has just been formed. We then zoom into a pool of water where we see the first cells form, and then become eye witness to mitosis followed by the first animals crawling form the sea onto land. Then we are taken to the time of the dinosaurs, we witness a battle between among a tyrannosaurus, and a stegosaurus with the tyrannosaurus eventually winning the battle. The end of the score brings about the extinction of the dinosaurs. The third segment in Fantasia is the \"Dance of Hours\". This segment features animals dancing the ballet, including a hippo in a tutu. The animals dance around gracefully at first but as the music reaches its climax the ballet starts coming apart at the seams. The alligators are chasing the hippo, and the hippo is running from the unwanted advances. On the final drum beat the entire place collapses in on its self. The final segments are tied together; the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" the demon Chernabog is seen summoning form the grave enslaved souls. Chernabog is seen with other demons and ghosts skeletons and others preparing for an invasion of a kind. Then with the sounding of the Angelus bell Chernabog along with the rest of the daemons are sent back into hiding. As the music Ave Maria is played we follow a line of robed figures through a forest to a cathedral.This film was spectacular for its time, and is still a classic to this day. Nothing like Fantasia had ever been done, the mixing of some of the world's most fantastic classical musical master pieces with such imaginative and amazing animation from some of the times most talented animators makes for a visual and aural delight and one of the best animated movies of all time. The many themes both challenge the audience and delight them.

However that's exactly what makes it so distinguish, original and unique. It's a very imaginative and creative Disney classic. For good and for bad, one thing is for sure: Disney never made anything like this before or after. That is, of course, with the exception of 'Fantasia 2000' but seriously there is no comparison. The original 'Fantasia' is a much superior work of art than the flawed 'Fantasia 2000', which fails miserably to repeat the magic and charm of the original.But, back to the original (which is the one that really matters to comment in this space), never before had the music and the magic of cinema made such a spectacular combination. It's interesting and wonderful how the music wins life and (just a force of expression) the images transform themselves in music. This \"know-how\" was also used in the famous Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\".'Fantasia' cannot be considered a masterpiece for me, but it can be considered almost a masterpiece. It has 8 distinguish segments. Save the live-action introductions with Leopold Stokowski as the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the voice of Deems Taylor to narrate the introductions, the whole thing is animated and without dialogs. Classical music replaces dialogs and speaks for what you see.Artwork is variable according to the segments, but always excellent and colorful. As for the segments, 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' and 'The Nutcracker Suite' are all about art, imagination and creativity. 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' is perhaps the most popular Mickey Mouse cartoon ever, it's clever and fun. 'The Rite of Spring' is okay but slow and my least favorite here (besides, it requires patience). 'The Pastoral Symphony' is immensely charming and sweet. 'Dance of the Hours' is very humorous, with ostriches, hippos, crocodiles and elephants as ballet dancers - these animals, particularly the hippos, are a comic relief. The polemic 'Night on Bald Mountain' is cool but a nightmarish experience - it's strong, disturbing and scary. 'Ave Maria' is good, even if slow and unexciting.Title in Portugal: 'Fantasia'."], ["Truly timeless", "I don't know how old I was when I first watched this, but I may very well have been too young to comprehend how long ago it was made... much less how old some of the score is.

Putting images to classical music is a great way to get those of us(yup, guilty as charged) who just wouldn't sit down to listen to something like that under normal circumstances to experience it. Cartoons have aged remarkably well(not just this, in general)... what needs to, and/or is meant to, look imposing still does(I won't blow what they are, for anyone who hasn't seen this... and those who have may very well know exactly what I'm referring to), and the whole thing still works, almost 70 years after it was originally released. Little sound is added... the visuals are scored almost entirely with the performances of the orchestral classics, the way the animation brings the well-known composed pieces to life. Drawing styles vary, and some segments are naturalistic, others almost psychedelic. Colors are vivid, and sometimes underplayed. Segments are briefly introduced by a speaker.

Classical music was interpreted by Disney animators, resulting in surreal fantasy and playful escapism. Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra provided the music for eight segments by the composers Tchaikovsky, Moussorgsky, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Ponchielli, Bach, Dukas, and Schubert. Not all the sequences were created equally, but a few are simply glorious, such as \"Night on Bald Mountain,\" \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" and \"The Nutcracker Suite.\" The animation ranges from subtly delicate to fiercely bold. The screen bursts with color and action as creatures transmute and convention is thrust aside.

This film is basically Walt Disney giving free reign to his animators to take some of the world's most famous classic music and put animation to it. This includes the work of Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Mussorgsky and Ponchielli among many others.It's funny but if you want to start a fight in a Disney crowd you've usually just got to mention this title and you're going to get a wide range of responses. Some people think this film is a masterpiece while others find it to be a complete bore with very little redeeming qualities. Some people love the film but think it's not for children. I personally hated this movie the first time I saw it as a kid but I revisited it for the first time in probably twenty-five years and I was shocked to see how much I enjoyed it.

I'd say the only thing that really hampers this movie is the fact that it clocks in at 125-minutes. I would argue that when the intermission comes it might be best to walk away from the film for more than the 15 minutes just so it doesn't become too much.

It is the third Disney animated feature having been made, the first two was \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937) and \"Pinocchio\" (1940).Basic plot: In this film, eight segments are set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, while music critic and composer Deems Taylor makes an introduction to each of the segments.Just to point out some of the segments: In \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", Mickey Mouse attempts to try out some of sorcerer Yen Sid's magic tricks. \"Rite of Spring\" deals with the evolution of life on Earth, from volcano eruptions to dinosaurs. In \"Dance of the Hours\", animals like hippos and alligators perform a comic ballet in four sections. In \"Night on Bald Mountain\", a devil summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain, so they can dance and fly through the air...Not only has \"Fantasia\" been a great part of my childhood, but I'll confirm this to be a great favorite within the world of Disney animated movies. Here, the classical music and the animated segments fit perfectly with each other. The animation is just wonderful for something made in 1940. And besides from Deems Taylor introducing the segments, this film proves the fact not all movies need to always have dialogue in order to make a good story. It is also amazing on how \"Fantasia\" still holds the record for being the longest Disney animated movie, with the running time of at least two hours.Favorite segment: In my opinion, \"Rite of Spring\" wins.Most funny segment: Here, \"Dance of the Hours\" takes the cake.Most scary segment: \"Night on Bald Mountain\", clearly.This is how I grew up with \"Fantasia\": My family used to have this film on a British VHS originally released 1991. Together with several other animated features like Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" and Toei's \"Panda no Daibouken\", I could watch \"Fantasia\" many times without getting bored. \"Night on Bald Mountain\" was the only segment I couldn't manage to sit through. And I thought \"Rite of Spring\" was kinda creepy as well, thinking about how the Earth (which looked like a giant fireball) came closer and closer to the screen. The rest was no problem, as I watched it with pure pleasure. Prior to my big sister getting the same film on DVD several years ago, my family decided to get rid of the VHS.In my opinion, when it comes to musical animated features, as well as Disney movies, then nothing beats \"Fantasia\". This film can be watched by everybody, both children and adults. If you still haven't watched this film, then I highly recommend you to watch this one at least once. My overall rating: A well deserved 10/10."], ["Never imagine (possible spoiler)", "I thought Fantasia was just another Disney movie, but after watching the film my opinion changed; in a positive way.I was impressed with the creativity and the quality of the element combinations between the orchestra music and the animations. Also, there was a smooth transition feeling between the various segments of the movie; making each segment more enjoyable.The colors in this magical musical animation were amazing. All the scenes were pretty much full of colors and made me feel as I was a child again. The colors were bright and dark at times, but they were brought to live with the music allowing the audience to relax and enjoy the visual elements.The lighting plays an important part of the film. In parts of the film, like in the Sorcerer's Apprentice, the lights and shadow gave a more realistic look at the animation. For example, Mickey Mouse salutes Mr. Taylor (the narrator) at the end of the segment, providing a unique interaction between real and fictional characters. Lastly, during the orchestra intermissions, the audience can appreciate the human and musical instrument's shadows as they are living to take a break; this effect lets the audience feel as you are sitting down in a theater, watching the orchestra perform live.Fantasia is educational and provided a lot of elements for the audience to use their imagination. A good example is the prehistoric segment as it educates about different dinosaurs and their food sources; and how the world changed to a new era. Also, there are other segments in which people can relate to their belief and dreams.Overall the movie is great to explore imagination and enjoy classical music with art, but I would recommend not watching it if you are tired or you could relax too much and fall asleep. To fully enjoy the movie, make sure you are rested and transport to a colorful world.I must add that Fantasia is not for all audiences unless you enjoy classical music and animations; and if you are watching the film with children, please be prepared to explain some scenes as the general audience standards for rating movies and TV shows have changed. Thus, parents should watch the film before their kids to be ready to answer questions such as the naked angels, dark and mean Gods, Mickey Mouse using an ax to chop up a broom, fighting horses acting like ducks, and so on.

A labor of love for the man behind Mickey Mouse, the movie is split into eight different segments with a noted piece of Western classical music (conducted by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra) serving as the backdrop for the story in each one.Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor opens the film with abstract, expressionistic images that coincide with the music. There is no real story here; it's probably the most dream-like segment of the entire film.Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite is given a new look in the movie; eschewing its traditional story for a ballet of nature as set to the tones of the Chinese Dance, Waltz of the Flowers, and Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy among others.The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas is by far the most recognizable and popular segment of the entire film. A showcase Mickey Mouse who plays the titular character that uses magic to bring a broomstick to life carry out his chores, with disastrous results.Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring is visualized as the gradual transformation of Earth from an uninhabitable world of roiling seas and volcanoes to the age of the dinosaurs. An impressive showcase for special animated effects as well as the realistic appearance of the dinosaurs.The Pastoral Symphony (Ludwig van Beethoven's 6th) is set against the backdrop of Mount Olympus and Ancient Greek mythology is utilized to tell the story. Centaurs, unicorns, Pegasus, Zeus, and other gods and creatures appear in the most fanciful and elegant segment of the film.Coming from Amilcare Ponchielli's opera \"La Gioconda\", The Dance of the Hours is a ballet that progresses from day to night with ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators performing the act. The result is one of the best segments of the film.The finale is the combination of Modeste Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria into one major segment showcasing the clash between good and evil. The talents of animator Vladimir (Bill) Tytla and famed illustrator Kay Nielsen take center stage.Fantasia was, and still is, unlike any film ever made when it was first released, for the film was the first to utilize a stereophonic soundtrack to replicate to concert hall experience in theaters. Though time has dated it, Fantasia remains a captivating work where seeing it just once is not enough."], ["Amazing Animated Musical", "Disney was never a great part of my childhood. I watched a couple of its classics, but I don't have that many fond memories of them. They mostly leave me indifferent nowadays. So I never imagined I'd be watching Fantasia. But a friend recommended me an animated musical called Allegro Non Troppo, which is a bit of a parody of Fantasia, and suggested I watch the Disney movie first to appreciate it better.So I watched it, and I wasn't ready for it. Fantasia may just be one of the finest musicals and animated movies ever made. It's certainly the best thing I've ever seen from Disney. The premise is to create animation that matches classical compositions by Beethoven, Ponchielli, Stravinsky, etc. And it's a beautiful mix of visuals and music.Nearly all animated sequences are great, but some stand out, like the \"Night on Bald Mountain\", when the devil summons out demons and the spirits of the dead; \"The Sorceror's Apprentice\", which even someone who hasn't seen this movie knows since it's the famous cartoon of Mickey Mouse as a magician animating a broom to do his bidding; \"The Nutcracker Suite\", which shows a dazzling dance of nature and fairies; and \"Pastoral Symphony\", set in a beautiful mythological Greek setting.Even by today's Pixar standards, the animation is breathtaking, and I do believe some of the colors achieved in this movie can't even be reproduced by the hard-working makers of Wall-E and The Incredibles. Some of the color sequences are so good they stand up to Kubrick's psychedelic light show in 2001: A Space Odissey.This movie was awarded two Oscars for its contribution to the art of cinema. I don't think it'd have been too much to give it an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. At least it deserved an Oscar for best screenplay, even if no words are heard in this musical. But I imagine creating animated sequences that match existing musical pieces was no easy task.All in all, Fantasia is a great movie. Save for a slow beginning and a few dull segments, it's always entertaining and magical. And now remains to see if Allegro Non Troppo can live up to it."], ["Fantasiastic!", "I've always been a fan of classical music- its such a universal form of music. This movie is one of my earliest memories, and I believe it is due mainly to the enduring tunes that are ingrained alongside each image. Since it is composed of individual sketches, I'll review each one separately.Toccata and Fugue- It is a marvelous way to start out the program- first showing the instruments as if we are watching a regular concert and gradually drifting off to the heights of animated imagination. The abstract imagery beautifully compliments the bold and whimsical music.The Nutcracker Suite- Probably the most famous ballet of all time and the music leaves no reason to wonder why. Each little vignette is a treasure, from the cute Asian mushrooms to the exuberant Russian flowers to the seductive Arabian goldfish. The falling snowflakes in the stirring Waltz of the Flowers are the icing on the very decadent finale. The rich colors in this sequence hold the visuals up to par with the spectacular music.The Sorcerer's Apprentice- Somehow I never liked this one as much- perhaps I didn't care for the intrusion of an obvious cartoon character in my special fantasy film. The harshness of Mickey Mouse killing the broomstick and the world turning deathly pale also gave me a terror from which I never really recovered. I do realize that Fantasia was built entirely around this segment to boost the flagging appeal of Disney's original hero and I can appreciate this segment as such, for it truly worked. The redesign that went into this short has carried the mouse into the hearts of every generation since.The Rite of Spring- This has got to be my least favorite of all the pieces. The music is very harsh and savage- which is what the composer intended- it's just not the style I like to listen to. That does not help matters as there is also an exceedingly long section of darkness, planets and a very uninhabited earth. The grand scope of this is ingenious, panning through galaxies to our planet, but it takes a long time and coupled with a few minutes of molten lava, it tends to get monotonous and boring. Since the music is not particularly inspiring, there is nothing for a good while that holds my interest and I usually end up skipping to the dinosaurs. Once it actually gets to living creatures, things pick up. The Tyrannosaurus scene is quite entertaining, if not very true to facts. I love the blaring \"DUN DUN DUN\"s! as the Rex triumphs over his prey. The story and music match perfectly.The Pastoral Symphony- Definitely my favorite section. I am a huge fan of Beethoven and mythology- could it get better? The music is divinely beautiful and the animation is loaded with colorful, glittering eye-goodies. My mouth actually waters when I watch this because things look enticing enough to eat. Elegant Pegasus and mischievous cupids prance around a rainbow countryside as centaurs pair off in a sort of blind-date-beauty-pageant. The main gods of Greek and Roman Mythology make an appearance here, from the drunken Bacchus to the angelic Diana. It's mostly a lot of fairytale fluff, but for someone who likes to spot the nuances of mythological lore, or just enjoys a bit of beautiful animation, it's a more than enjoyable waste of time.Dance of the Hours- Admittedly, I can't watch it now without trying to sing the hello mudda song, but this is a really funny bit in its own right. Taking such awkward animals as the gangly ostrich or the lumbering hippo and turning them into ballet dancers is a stroke of comedic genius. The seductive crocodile is my favorite character- what an odd charmer! The music somehow lends itself to hilarity, making this one of the most mixed up ballets I've ever seen!Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria- Deliciously dark and radiantly pure, the juxtaposition of these two pieces could not have been more perfect. The burning passions of the night run rampant across the screen and speakers as Chernabog summons the powers of hell to his mountaintop. At the height of his theme, a single sound and glimmer of light shatters the chaos. The moment is quite beautiful as the lone voice in the terror, so low it is barely heard, breaks the spell and dispels the darkness of evil. Slowly, the voice grows and is accompanied by many lights and voices until it breaks out into the full theme of Ave Maria and we come from the cave into a brilliant, hopeful dawn. Quite an inspiring ending to any film.The movie is also filled with an introduction to each segment as well as a short on \"the soundtrack.\" Each piece was made with a care that you will be hard-pressed to match in this era. Fantasia 2000 showed a desire to learn from such times. I hope the spark continues to grow."], ["\"Fantasia\" is pure magic", "The 3rd animated Disney classic is a unique movie experience. It is a rare and completely different movie than what people are used to.\"Fantasia\" actually consists in 8 segments, being each one totally different. Aside the introductions by Deems Taylor before the segments, there are no dialogs. Art is above everything else, combining animation with classical music. The music is performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra and conducted by Leopold Stokowski.Most everyone seems to love \"Fantasia\" nowadays. It has many fans, including me. It is considered a classic now. But when it came out in 1940 it was a commercial failure.\"Fantasia\" is a masterpiece, a pure work of art and magical. Artwork is excellent and special effects either, proving that even back then they already worried about attention to detail.About the 8 pieces, let me give a small opinion about each one of them:1. Toccata and Fugue in D MinorI don't mind how difficult it is to understand what is this about. It's a festival of art and magic. Simply beautiful, very creative, imaginative and original.2. The Nutcracker SuiteAnother brilliant segment. It takes on a famous ballet piece of music to show us flowers, fairies, dancing mushrooms and seasons of the year. Very good.3. The Sorcerer's ApprenticePerhaps the most popular piece from \"Fantasia\", it is another one of my favorites. Pretty good but also hilarious because Mickey Mouse attempts to use some of his master's magical powers before learning how to control them. Things go out of control, as expected. My favorite part is Mickey's dream: he dreams that he is controlling the mighty seas and starry skies - truly a marvelous and magical sequence.4. The Rite of SpringInteresting, but not one of my favorites. This one starts very well, by showing what science considers to be the formation of our planet and life. It shows images and special effects that look amazingly real, such as the infinitive space, volcanoes in action and boiling lava and earthquakes. It also shows us the time when dinosaurs ruled the world and humans didn't exist yet.5. The Pastoral SymphonyExcellent! I absolutely love this one. This is a sweet story inspired on Greek mythology. It has lots of cute and adorable creatures such as flying horses, unicorns, cupids and angels, as well as original creatures like centaurs and gods. The music is beautiful and the artwork is wonderful. The flying horses and unicorns look the same but with different fur color (that is so cute), while cupids and angels look the same except with different hair color (very cute).6. Dance of the HoursAnother one of the best segments from \"Fantasia\". It takes place in the garden of a palace in Italy. What we see here is the most amusing ballet ever with ostriches, hippos, elephants and crocodiles dancing ballet. I guess all these animals are here for comical effect, especially the hippos (I love hippos).7. Night on Bald MountainThe only piece I really don't like from \"Fantasia\". This features strong stuff and is extremely dark, uncomfortable to watch and disturbing, as well as very creepy. Chernabog is a horrifying character.8. Ave MariaThis sequence is a great ending for \"Fantasia\" and is included in \"Night on Bald Mountain\". Although slow, it has the same general greatness from \"Fantasia\". The short itself is religious but artistic.This should definitely be on Top 250."], ["Groundbreaking Disney", "FANTASIA (1940) **** Classic Disney animation experiment: incorporating classical music to its stunning, ground-breaking visual opulence including Mickey Mouse in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and \"Night on Bald Mountain\".

Walt Disney even planned Fantasia as a living artwork, evolving with new sections as the years passed. Its the only animated film I can name until the 70s that is \"mature\" (Not to insult the rest of Disney's filmography).And despite its 75th anniversary right around the corner, Fantasia has aged like fine wine. Its unique, magical, with a universal style. Each segment offers a new setting, the beautiful animation set to the greatest in classical music, each piece matching the tone perfectly.

There's variety, consistently fresh without a single weak link or out-of-place short.If you're looking for plot or character, Fantasia isn't for you. Outside of the intermissions, its practically silent. The stories are quite simple. If its not your taste, or if you're in the wrong mindset, you might become weary. Its 2 hours long, slow, and style-over-subsistence set to a pretty calm genre of music. But its still a wonderful movie, and I wouldn't call it boring.

Ironically, the much celebrated \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" is the lesser segment here. It's just a bit too linear when compared to the rest of them.

That aspect of the film I absolutely love; at its core the concept of classical music + animation is just wonderful. The development of music videos as a medium owe a lot to this film.

A lot of the film is utterly wonderful and compelling-Rite of Spring, Nutcracker Suite are as perfect as animation has gotten, Toccata and Fugue in D Minor is still hypnotic-but some of it is a bit dated.

It's uneven in places, but it's a towering achievement in animation, especially considering the time in which it was made, and that it was all done completely by hand. It is simply incredible.Be aware, however, that the soundtrack for the DVD release is not quite the same as it was for the 50th anniversary release in 1990, and the VHS and laserdisc releases that followed the next year. The 50th anniversary soundtrack was a faithful and painstaking reproduction of Fantasound using original documents from the Disney archives for the cues, and those who saw it in 1990 at a surround-sound theater will recall the music swirling and jumping around the room at times, making it almost as mind-boggling as what appeared on screen. This is what was encoded on the VHS and laserdisc releases that followed the 50th anniversary release, and those with equipment capable of decoding Dolby 2.0 (\"Pro-Logic\") will hear it with either of those video releases. It was lauded in 1990 as the first time that Fantasound had been heard since 1940, and it is something to behold.The DVD release, however, has an entirely different mix of the musical elements in both Dolby 2.0 and Dolby 5.0. The sound is cleaner than on the 1990 release, but it concentrates everything up front and carries only concert-hall reverb in the rear channels. I've kept my laserdisc copy, and that's the one I watch for the best effect.

I mean no disrespect to Corey Burton, but while he did an excellent job syncing to the film, his voice has a completely different timbre than Taylor's, and I can't help thinking that someone else could have come closer.BTW, the reason they dubbed Deems Taylor's voice for the DVD is that the interstitials for the original \"roadshow\" presentation were trimmed for subsequent releases, including the 50th anniversary release. They found the missing film elements of Taylor's monologues, but their audio elements were lost, and rather than try to dub just those small bits, they re-dubbed the monologues in their entirety.

Arranged by Leopold Stokowski himself, this segment lets me see the piece in a whole new light, and the imaged the artists conjoured up were brilliant: big shafts of light and big exploasions of color during the closing Toccata, and a beautiful variety of images throughout the fugue.2. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker suite\"opening with the \"suger plum fairy\", we get exactly that: suger plum fairies making everything brighter and more shiny, and ending with the \"waltz of the flowers\" where it is exactly the opposite. Winter is brought in by the fairies who then skate on a frozen lake.3. Paul Dukas' \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\"The most famous Fantasia segment, while not my personal favorate, is still pretty entertaining and unforgettable. a regular Disney character weilding an ax? how often do you see that?4. Igor Stravinsky's \"rite of spring\"the most boring fantasia segment ever.

There will be mild spoilers ahead, though I can't imagine there are too many people likely to be reading this who haven't seen Fantasia:The conceit here is a pairing of classical music with animated segments done with the music in mind. It was developed when it became clear that production costs on \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", initially intended as a Silly Symphony, became so great that they could never be recouped by a short subject. So Walt Disney came up with the idea of a \"concert film\", or different animated segments featuring varied pieces of classical music.Music critic Deems Taylor was selected to be the on-screen host introducing the segments and Leopold Stowkowski conducted the orchestra, after having conducted the scoring of the short which started it all.There were eight segments, with the last two being a thematic pairing of A Night on Bald Mountain by Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Schubert. These are basically one animated piece with two separate musical accompaniments. The others are individual and self-contained works. The segments are, in order:Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Bach, which is simply very abstract animation in time to the music.Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky, which is various mushrooms, flowers and other fanciful objects dancing to various segments from the ballet.The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas, with Mickey as the titular character getting into trouble when he takes his master's magical talisman (his hat) only to unleash something he didn't expect and can't control. The most well-known individual segment and the third best, after the last two.Rite of Spring by Stravinsky, which inspired no less than the formation of the planet, the beginnings of life on through to the extinction of the dinosaurs.The Pastoral by Beethoven, where male and female centaurs frolic, flirt and court in an idyllic setting. This segment has occasioned controversy and censorship since the film's first release.Dance of the Hours by Amilcari Ponchielli, which whimsically features four separate ballets corresponding to Morning (ostriches), Afternoon (hippos) Evening (elephants) and Night (alligators). The four converge in the end piece, with comical results.The final pairing is also probably the most majestic and moving section of the film. In A Night on Bald Mountain, Chernobog, a devil, orchestrates a dance by spirits, demons and assorted things on and around Bald Mountain. Just when things reach a feverish and climactic pitch, a bell tolls and dark night gives way to the dawn, forcing all to flee, including Cherobog. Ave Maria rises as light banishes dark and monks march into a ruined cathedral. The contrasts are magnificent.This is, in my opinion, Walt Disney's masterpiece. I've seen Fantasia on the big screen in one of its re-releases, had this film on VHS, I have it on DVD and on Blu-Ray. It looks good on VHS, very good on DVD and extraordinary on Blu-Ray.

Part of this is because it doesn't look like any other animated film that Walt Disney ever made. I liked some of the adaptations like 'Pinocchio' and 'Bambi', but 'Fantasia' seems to have been made as an endeavor for something new. Its one thing to use animation to get the characters around a cute story but it takes a giant leap of faith to create something this bold. Cynics don't like because it doesn't have a plot. My defense is that sometimes I like watching a movie without a blueprint.What stays with most people are the cute sections. Most everyone remembers Mickey Mouse in 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and 'The Dance of the Hours'. But I watch this film for it's darker more serious sections. My favorite is the last one, 'A Night on Bald Mountain' in which Chernobog, a satanic creature letting loose evil spirits upon the night. I also liked 'Rite of Spring' a chilling epic about dinosaurs stalking the earth.I also remember tiny moments, little throw-away details. I loved the introduction of the soundtrack, a shy little line that is introduced and then moves bashfully in from the side of the screen.I saw 'Fantasia' before and after it's restoration. The pre-restoration print was almost unbearable. Many of the scenes were faded and the soundtrack had scratches and pops. I nearly walked out but I was ultimately glad I stayed because I could later make a comparison. The restoration is clean and crisp, the colors are striking and the soundtrack is flawless. What I also appreciated is that the restoration chose not to stretch the film to widescreen. Careful preparation went into every single aspect of 'Fantasia' and the whole movie was constructed to fit a certain aspect ratio. Stretching it means that you lose a percentage of the top and bottom of the screen.'Fantasia' was chosen by The American Film Institute as the second best animated film of all time (second only to 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'). I think that this decision was made because 'Snow White' came first. I think 'Fantasia' is a far superior film in every way. 'Snow White' was a drop in the bucket to what animated features to could.

Not only that, but that was the best version of that symphony I had ever heard. Back to Fantasia then. Each piece was expertly introduced by Deems Taylor, and unlike its sequel didn't take too long.(Even the soundtrack vignette was interesting) In the sequel, almost half of the film felt like too much introduction and not enough music. Fantasia rectified that problem brilliantly:1. Bach's Toccata- Brilliant silhouettes of the orchestra, and then masterful abstract images. The orchestra played the piece to a phenomenal standard, and I hate to say this, but I actually prefer the piece orchestrated. It was originally written for organ, you see. The best thing about Stokowski is that you see him conducting without a baton, which is exceedingly clever.2. Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker- I recommend you see the ballet, because it is a knockout. This is coming from a classical music lover. The animation was superb in this vignette. The most impressive thing though was the fact that the finishes immediately went into the next scene, without it being hackneyed. The waltz, or Dance of the Snow Fairies, was the highlight of this vignette, reminding me so strongly of Christmas.3. Dukas's Scorceror's Apprentice- The most famous vignette, is the only vignette to feature in the sequel. YenSid(Disney backwards) has a magic hat, which he leaves lying around, and Mickey Mouse picks it up, and encounters various problems. the animation is very good here, and while I'm not a huge fan of the piece, I still found it enjoyable.4. Stravinsky's Rite of Spring- This is the only reason why the movie isn't a 10. This vignette is far too long It's longer than the Beethoven. It is an interesting subject, dinosaurs, but the ballet wasn't simplified enough. This was boring, and was better left out. It was only here to give some historical context. However, there was beautiful animation and some lovely instrumental solos. Stravinsky hated what the film did to his work, but anyway I don't like Stravinsky much. I had no problem with the animation or the way it was performed, it was just too long.5. Beethoven's pastoral Symphony- This is a fantastic piece of music. I am a huge fan of Beethoven, and I have all his 9 symphonies on my IPod. My favourites are this, the Choral and the Eroica. I loved the fact that they chose a Greek mythological setting, because it looked gorgeous. My dad who is a conductor wasn't keen on the centaurs, but I loved the winged horses, Bacchus and Zeus (who competes with Chernabog as the most frightening character of the movie). This vignette was so relaxing to watch; think it as like reciting a poem.6. Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours-This was the funniest vignette of the film, and one of the many gems of Disney. It was a bit unrealistic of course, but it was fun. At first, I was worried that the most famous scene from the opera La Giaconda, would be ruined by the animation. But it wasn't. It was perfect. Even the elephants and hippos, considering their size, danced so elegantly, I was shocked. This vignette is a must-see if you want some comedy.7. Mussorgsky's Night on Bare Mountain- Now this was my personal favourite, as when I first watched it when I was 10, and I was terrified of Chernabog. The music is also very hard to play, as the mood is very hard to capture, but this is undoubtedly the finest recording of this music. Chernabog was genuinely frightening, and a masterful creation. And the animation, while dark, matched the music, which is enough to give you nightmares, flawlessly. It was very like a Witch's Sabbath, which was what the composer originally intended. Do you know, that for his underrated fantasy movie Legend, Ridley Scott based Tim Curry's Darkness on Chernabog? Children may find it a bit too frightening, and adults may find it inappropriate, as there is a tiny glimpse of nudity. But it was still an effective vignette, and one of my favourite Disney moments actually.8. Schubert's Ave Maria- This is a beautiful song, and Stokowski did it justice. The harmonies and animation were perfectly captured. how could you say this was boring? The animation couldn't have been happy looking, it would have completely ruined the mood of the song. It was beautifully sung by Juillietta Novis, who was so quiet that you had to turn the volume up, but that was the intention. The thing that impressed me most, was the complete contrast of this from the Mussorgsky, so the key of Ave Maria was so well chosen. (It is sung in many different keys.) In conclusion, the most underrated of the earlier Disney efforts, is well worth watching and a true animated classic! Also I was offended by the review that said that it was the worst movie ever made, and that the people who love this movie need new taste, that is plain insulting to anyone who grew up with this film. 9/10 Bethany Cox."], ["Fantasia", "I just saw this movie for the first time in my life yesterday.

It's priceless, but is probably one of the more controversial elements in this uneven mixture of Disney shorts with the emphasis on music.Personally, I'm fonder of Disney doing SNOW WHITE, BAMBI or PINOCCHIO, and found certain segments a turn-off (\"The Rite of Spring\" episode seemed awfully barren and dull), and others a complete delight. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" with Mickey Mouse trying his magic with disastrous results is one of the best.Another very impressive segment is \"A Night On Bald Mountain\" which has every scary element giving it the height of interest, followed soothingly by the closing \"Ave Maria\" sequence.Bold in color and conception, this is an uneven blend of Disney's artistic work from his army of animators. He certainly was an artist who wanted to \"stretch\" and this was his exercise in uniquely imaginative images and sounds. My favorite moments came during \"The Nutcracker Suite\" with mushrooms in the shape of Chinese men doing their intricate thing and the spidery webs glowing like gold as tiny fairies sprinted across them.

It's not really for classical music lovers, who are bound to be offended by the way the works are treated, and it's certainly not for people who can't stand classical music. Generally speaking, It's too low for the highbrows and too high for the lowbrows. So who is \"Fantasia\" for, really? Aside from one obvious, 1960s-inspired answer - recreational drug users - I would say it's for animation buffs willing to overlook the pretentious silliness of some scenes and admire instead the striking images of the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" sequence or the abstract designs accompanying Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" or the humor of \"Dance of the Hours\" with its dancing hippopotamuses and alligators, or the segment that started the whole project, \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\"(\"Fantasia\" was spoofed in the Warner Bros. cartoon \"A Corny Concerto,\" hosted by a bespectacled Elmer Fudd.

Walt Disney produced it and it is probably one of their biggest achievements ever. I have never watched it until now and it was a really good movie. Many people view this film as one of the best animated films ever and I can agree with that after watching it. This film is so advanced for being made in 1940. It was amazing how they did it all. The music in this film is also well known by many and was a really big part to the movie. The Philadelphia Orchestra was in charge of the music. There was very little dialogue and that's why the music was huge because it basically took over for the little dialogue. The music really goes with the movie. The colors in the movie were also amazing. This time period was the beginning for colors to be introduced and they did a great job with it.

The real high light comes with director Ben Sharpenstein's lively treatment of Paul Dukas' \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". Mickey Mouse stars as the magician's underling who runs amok with his master's wand, with rather damp results.Other classical pieces don't get such a wonderful treatment.

The Fantasia Anthology is unmissable!", "WOW! I've seen this movie lots and lots of times and I STILL am breathless by its powerful spell! \"Fantasia\" is definitely Walt Disney's greatest masterpiece, cartoon-films just don't come better - not even these days, I don't think because these days animated films are just getting worse leaving us with less good films than we deserve to see and it's totally unacceptable. But this kind of feature just never fails to amaze me every time I see it, it has absolutely EVERYTHING you would want to see in a fantastic film, e.g Walt Disney has chosen a very good selection of classical music pieces, the animation is just stunning with rich colours, the sound powerfully attracts your attention being so loud and bold and clear (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor the beginning piece) and at the very end of that segment you see Leopold Stokowski, \"Fantasia\"'s conductor, conducting the Philadepia Orchestra with so much power and emotion and he is stood on his platform doing this while a dramatic sunset shining with glorious rays of light just attracts the eye and. Toccata and Fugue has been visualized in abstraction and the abstract images that Walt Disney has created, from what I've seen, aren't quite as attractive and as unusual as Oskar Fishinger's interpretations but you can kind of accept it. The upcoming pieces tell a proper story and, except for \"A Night on Bald Mountain\" (because it's so frightening), I think they are great stories and ANOTHER reason I think \"Fantasia\" is such a special, incredible film is that it magically gets people to just wake up, get out of things like Eminem and Pink and The Black-Eyed Peas and the ever cocky Robbie Williams and just appreciate the beauty and the emotion of classical music whether it's contemporary and recent or extremely old. My father gave myself, Natalie (my sister) and William (my half-brother) \u00a3100 each to spend during the summer. I intended to spend it on \"The Fantasia Anthology\" which is a 3-DVD box set on \"Fantasia\", \"Fantasia 2000\" and \"The Fantasia Legacy\" (a special bonus disc). The old box-set I had for this powerful film was called \"The Fantasia DVD Collection\" which was so poor and incredibly dull compared to the \"Anthology\" which cost exactly \u00a3100. But \"The Fantasia Anthology\" only plays in Region 1 and that's not where we are in England, sorry to say! However Richard, my step-dad, did manage to track down one from China that plays in any region. Sadly, as much as I adored it and preferred it by a long way to the old one which was rubbish, it was poor and now we've got to wait for a replacement! However, after finding out that there were LOTS of delays between here and China, I wanted my \u00a3100 back again and this time we've managed to track down one from our very own homeland - ENGLAND! It does still play only on Region 1 but we did buy an all-region DVD player for my room and, so I believe, chucked out the plain Region 2 player. We believe it'll arrive here by mid-next-week at the very latest! I CAN HARDLY WAIT! I urge you! If you want to literally feel invigourating power from a 3-Disc DVD Box set then you've got to save up your money whether it's pounds, dollars, francs (in the case of France) and get it... FAST! It will be so exciting to see the original film uncut and the scenes probably not a soul from this generation has seen. There are so appealing and amazing, however, I suffered great disappointment when I discovered that the soft, sticky voice of Deems Taylor was dubbed by the irritating voice of Corey Burton. I just don't get it! Why would Disney productions want to get rid of the real thing, the original voice? They kept the original soundtrack! So why bin the original narrative-descriptions? For crying out LOUD! Are they totally mad? How VERY silly?! Walt Disney said so himself that he intended for all his films to be as original as possible and I think it's absolutely shameful for this modern generation of film-makers to just go against his wishes! Deems Taylor's voice is like butterscotch angel-delight and Corey Burton's voice is like a box of kitchen-knives. When I heard THAT voice and not the original one I thought, \"oh, NO! Nearly 2 hours of that horrid voice and what's more we don't have the opportunity to hear the original narrator talk to us himself in the deleted scenes!\" Corey Burton really, really drives me up the wall and makes me sad to have to overdub that lovely, original voice! When I hear him speak, with him thinking he is better than EVER at the fun job of narrating \"Fantasia\", I can tell he's just so full of himself, and, yeah OK, narrating a film as stunning as this must be a lot of fun but this role is Deems Taylor's and NOT Corey Burton's!

How about stun? Enthrall? Thrill? Amuse? Terrify? How about all these things in the same movie???\"Fantasia\" is one prime example of a movie that benefits from repetition. Its charms, its imaginative brilliance, its gentle humor, its artistic genius are drawn out the more it is viewed.The \"Toccata and Fugue\" is an abstract dream.

I can't hear the Chinese Dance without seeing that cocksure mushroom trying desperately to catch up on the dance steps of his brethren.Beethoven's \"Pastorale\" has many highlights, including the Pegasus who learns to fly.

I love watching Mickey wet his finger--in the middle of a maelstrom--to try to turn the page. The way the artists play with light and color make this segment truly nightmarish.\"The Rite of Spring\" is amazing, especially when you consider that the artists of 1940 had to use their imagination regarding *exactly* what dinosaurs looked like (paleontology at the time being what it was).\"Dance of the Hours\" is a wonderful parody of ballet that brims with laugh-out-loud moments: Ben Ali Gator riding the hippo like a merry-go-round and, later, being flattened by her tonnage.\"Night on Bald Mountain\" is terrifyingly weird. The dancing harpies and ghouls are truly disturbing, and the sight of Chernobog at his most wrathful is enough to make anyone squish down in his or her theater seat just a little.\"Ave Maria\" is simply gorgeous, a fitting end.I can't help but be amazed at this film upon every viewing. It was years ahead of its time (a testament to the geniuses behind it), which explains the paltry box-office receipts.

In the realm of animation, Disney was pioneering with a wide collection of animated films and shorts but nothing to this scale had ever been attempted especially during the time(beginning of the 1940's) when it was made. Fantasia is by far one of the most inventive and awe-inspiring cinematic experiences I have ever been able to see in my life! As a young child I couldn't really appreciate the film so highly beyond it having some neat animation sequences, but as an adult there's so much more I have noticed and grown to be even more fond of.As I said a moment ago, Fantasia is a very inventive piece of work where you have such an eloquent blend of music and animation that come together to create a massive spectacle that you're unlikely to forget. The blending of these elements make each animated sequence full of meaning, emotion, splendor, and awe. Music is such a powerful tool when used to convey meaning within any visual entertainment, which in 1940 a film like this one was rather new for audiences to see. In a way, this film acts as a big experiment bringing filmed orchestral performances played to visualize the story in the music. As a child I was so fascinated by several of the animated sequences, but particularly I was most taken away by 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and 'The Rite of Spring' segments. Both of those segments blew me away with their animation and presentation. I never got tired of seeing these two segments, constantly watching them on repeat almost to the point where you could blindfold me and I would be able to describe to you exactly what is happening on screen. While at times, these animated segments delighted and wondered me but at the same time some would terrify me, specifically 'Night on Bald Mountain'. Getting an emotional reaction from a film like Fantasia is quite interesting not just because you wouldn't expect that from such an old film, but that acknowledgement of credit goes to stellar musical composition+visuals. Even though some moments did scare me, yet that wouldn't be enough to keep me from coming back.From the time I was maybe five or six to now being in my twenties, I will find myself coming back to Fantasia from time to time no matter what the occasion is. It's a timeless piece of entertainment that anyone of any age can go watch at any time in their life.

It is essentially a series of short stories - each as different from the other as you can imagine. I think that's the most important principle when enjoying this - you must use your imagination. The representations try, with varying degrees of success, to put more defined, ambiguous and occasionally abstract imagery alongside the music - some with humour (frequently using animals, birds, insects etc.) through to far more sinister and challenging imagery, that at times reminded me of something Fritz Lang might have produced in the 1920s.

Instead we are treated to eight pieces of classical music which are played over animated images that the creators thought best interpreted the music. These include a variety of styles of music; in some cases the animation tells a story; in others it is a succession of images, such as flowers and animals dancing, or appearing to dance and others are more abstract. Each piece is introduced to the viewers with a brief description of the music and its interpretation.It must be stated that the animation is absolutely stunning with incredible detail and motion; it is hard to believe it was hand drawn decades before CGI was invented. The most memorably section is 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' by Paul Dukas; where we see Mickey Mouse enchanting a broomstick to do his chores with disastrous results; this section also has the most obvious story and is the only one to feature an established Disney character. Other sections are equally enchanting; I particularly liked the interpretation of the 'Nutcracker Suite' by Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring'. On the downside it is a little long; younger viewers may prefer watching individual sections rather than sitting down for two hours.

When Fantasia came out, people didn't understand it. It was seen as being too high brow as it was cartoons set to classical music. This was something that the normal everyday citizen just didn't get. Walt's original idea was to have new scenes added to it every few years so it was always evolving while keeping some favorites intact. But since it flopped, Disney did what they always do. They put it into the vault only to be shipped out again decades later.Then came the 60's and suddenly the hippies loved it. The dreamy imagery, the surreal scenes, hippos dancing ballet. It all came together as something to see whether you were baked or not.The movie itself is a series of unconnected scenes of animation set to classical music. It starts with Beethoven's \"Tocata and Fugue\" and the animation here is very... experimental. It's not relying on any kind of linear plot but merely images that bring to mind what the music is suggesting.Next comes the Nutcracker Suite and we have scenes of flowers dancing to a Russian song, some mushrooms dancing to a Chinese song, fish, flowers and even fairies in the spring, summer, fall and finally winter.After that comes the one the everybody is familiar with where Mickey Mouse performs the Sorcerer's Apprentice and creates an army of mindless brooms to do his work much to his chagrin when they flood the room with water.This is followed by the Rite of Spring and as a child was my favorite because it features dinosaurs.Next is the Pastoral Symphony set in Greek times with all the fantastical beasts like Pegasi, centaurs, fawns and of course the gods themselves. This is so colorful and happy.The next is the Dance of the Hours with dancing ostriches, elephants, hippos and alligators. It starts slowly and then builds to a hilarious crescendo.And finally there's the sacred and the profane. There's Night on Bald Mountain representing Chernobog for the profane, and then Ave Maria to finish it off for the sacred.This is truly animation for the sake of animation. It shows what can be done and how music can truly elevate something that is so simple. They tried again with Fantasia 2000 but it just didn't work. Parts were good, it had some stand out pieces but for the most part they felt soulless. If you need to watch one, watch Fantasia 2000 first and then watch this one.

I hadn't seen it in years prior to this review so I was thrilled to watch it again. Fantasia is an enormous animation masterpiece, cut into segments all set to corresponding classical music. At the beginning and in between segments, Deems Taylor comes on screen, in front of the Philadelphia Orchestra to elaborate on details about the music and the story/scenes before they play. These parts are really insightful and regardless that this movie is otherwise entirely animated and known for it, I think they are important. It makes the world inside the movie so much more accessible. The animations range from abstract scenes with no meaning, to fictional stories, to historical accounts. They even have an intermission. I felt pretty classy just watching that part, watching the banter between the musicians. it made me wish I could get up quickly to buy a bag of popcorn. A very special \"guest\" comes on as well to educate the viewers about sound with Mr. Taylor.

All I can say is that the music, animation and narration are done wonderfully! My only problem with this film is that it doesn't have any audio, except for the music.

Fantasia takes that idea to an extreme, and what came from it was an unconventional, and beautiful film. The film is made up different animated segments, interluded with live action bits of the orchestra. Each segment tells a different story, but in a very unique way. The only dialogue is when the conductor directly addresses the audience, so the stories are told solely through music and animation. All of the movements in the animation line up perfectly to the music, and instead of taking a lot of time establishing characters, Fantasia delivers just the raw emotions. The only issue I have with Fantasia is that the segments are very different emotionally, so watching it all at once as a feature, while interesting, might not be as effective as just watching one segment at a time.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A Different Disney", "This film is a very different one, not only for Disney but in general.

As a kid we would always stop the movie before the quite scary and eerie Night on Bald Mountain segment. It was too much for us as kids, but now I can fully appreciate it.

Moving pictures edited sequentially to create a cohesive story, it was an art form that remained questionable as to whether or not people would leave their houses. Walt Disney himself decided to push the boundaries by making Fantasia. Typically music accompany film however the \"House of Mouse\" decided to reverse it by crafting film to accompany music. Six short animations providing imagery for the orchestral pieces of music that power these pictures. Safe to say this was incredibly experiment. There's no dialogue (aside from Deems Taylor introducing each segment), just a symphony or classic pieces conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The concept immediately had me hooked for the first few segments. One consisting of a montage of famous pieces from Tchaikovsky's 'The Nutcracker', Mickey Mouse returning in arguably the most memorable segment of the program titled 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and from there we have multiple tonal changes with each segment. It's certainly something I've not seen before, and for that I have to give it credit. It truly does deserve the critical acclaim that is has garnered throughout the years. However, I found Fantasia to have a slight novelty factor that made the \"film\" repetitive. After the intermission, you start to realise that you have another three segments to go through which nothing new will be introduced. I became numb to the revolutionary concept. The animated shorts are pleasant to watch that both entranced and enthralled me, yet I just felt like something was missing. It wasn't a \"film\" more so just an experiment to prove that the idea works. It's clear it does, so the next step would be to create a fully fledged story that involves classical music where there is emotional investment and a sense of wonderment. Experimentalism at its finest that evokes whimsical magic boasted by a euphoric selection of classical pieces and beautifully hand drawn animation."], ["Timeless", "I will review this movie and all the segments.1. Toccata and Fugue in D minor. This is a great way to introduce the audience to Fantasia, with abstract art. However it is one of my lesser favorite segments, since some of the visuals could have been done better. However this is just nitpicking. Not much to say about this segment, other than it's a great way to introduce the audience to Fantasia. 8/10.2. The Nutcracker Suite. This one i will have to say is my favorite segment from this entire movie. I find myself stoning to this segment everytime i watch it. And the visuals are just amazing. I mean, you just feel like your in the forest or in a garden throughout this entire segment. Probably my favorite scene is when Autumn comes and these fairies turn the green leaves orange or brown. Not much more to say other than, just perfect. 10/10.3. The Sorcerer's Apprentice. This one i love like everyone else, and i think it's a classic. However, i still think it is overrated. That is because this is most people's or at least alot of people's favorite segment, the reason is probably that it's the most famous segment. And i disagree with that, since there are many superior segments in this movie. But i still think it's creative, fun and well drawn. 9/10.4. The Rite of Spring. This i will have to say is my second favorite segment in Fantasia. Although science not art wrote the story of this segment, they create something artistic out of something scientific, and i love that. This segment is very need and original. This is what Disney's Dinosaur or Walking with Dinosaurs should have been. Sadly though this is some people's least favorite segment, since some people feel it's too long. Come on the Pastoral Symphony was just as long, and no one is complaining about that. And Dinosaur experts also complain about Jurassic Period Dinosaurs and Cretaceous Period Dinosaurs living together, and the fact that it wasn't a meteor but climate change that caused the extinction of the Dinosaurs. Now i'm not a Dinosuar expert, but from what i can gather from my research, this was pretty scientifically accurate for it's time. It wasn't generally accepted in the 1940s that a meteor caused the extinction of the Dinosaurs, and there were many theories as to why they became extinct. And as for the Jurassic and Cretaceous Dinosaurs living together, most Dinosaurs were at the time thought to have lived at the same time. Even Stravinsky didn't like this segment for some reason. Either way, this segment is a classic. I especially love the scene where the Prehistoric Bacteria are acting like cute Disney animals. That is just genius and adds alot of personality to the segment. And who can forget the famous fight scene between the Tyrannosaurus and the Stegosaurus. An absolute classic. 10/10.5. The Pastoral Symphony. This is another great segment. I love the idea of it, and the artstyle is great. Although it may be a little too cute for some people, the scene with Zeus makes up for that. Not much more to say about it. 9/10.6. The Dance of the Hours. This i will have to say is my least favorite segment of this entire movie. It's not bad, and it does fit the movie. And it is fitting to have a more comedic segment. However i for some reason didn't find it all that funny. However there were scenes that made me chuckle, and it is well drawn. 7/10.7. The Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria. This is my third favorite segment in this movie. I love the design of Chernobog and the depiction of hell. And the Ave Maria is just one of the most beautiful moment made by Disney. A great way to end the movie. Not much more to say about this segment that people haven't said before. 10/10.Other than a few of the segments not being that good, this movie does have a few other flaws. I really didn't think the movie needed the scenes with the host. I know Fantasia was suppose to become a film series, and this movie was meant to just be an introduction to that, and they were probably going to leave the host out for the other movies. But i still thought the host was boring to sit through.

We all praise Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, but for 2D animated films, Disney is most creative with Fantasia. It's wonderfully brilliant because if you think about it, it's one of the first AMVs to ever be made. It sets classical music to animation and manages to make wonderfully brilliant imagery. But its more than that, the music has three forms in Fantasia 1.) Music that tells a definite story, 2.) Music that paints definite pictures, and 3.) music that exists simply for its own sake.Fantasia is composed of eight orchestral pieces which I will list below.1.) Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach2.) Nutcracker Suite by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky3.) The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas4.) Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky5.) The Pastoral Symphony by Ludwig Van Beethoven6.) Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli7.) Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky8.) Ave Maria by Franz SchubertOne can love Fantasia purely because of the brilliant music but it's the beautiful imagery that really makes Fantasia stand out. So much of the life experience can be seen in these orchestrations because of how fantastically wonderful and yet mysterious it seems. Walt Disney really created something that was breath-taking in that he made something that added beauty to the life experience.Disney is known for being great at adapting stories: taking a story that we already know and adding a new take on it. The illusion is that Disney is creating new stories, which just isn't the case most of the time. However, with that said, Fantasia is something that is completely original because they're adding visuals to musical compositions. You can't adapt that, it has to be created and Disney really goes above and beyond with it.Fantasia is beauty incarnate, there is no better way to describe it. Watching Fantasia is a truly indescribable experience. It's wonder, it's joy, it's sadness, it's mystery, it's fear, but most of all it's magic, and it remains my favorite Disney piece. Fantasia truly is magnificent and will be remembered for all time."], ["I can't believe I haven't seen this until now!", "I grew up with the 2000's fantasia, which I have seen many times over. Maybe that's why I was so partial to it when I would hear that the first fantasia was so much better than the one I already knew. It turns out those people had a point. Nothing feels forced as the conductor and the musicians around him actually stop to breathe in between the pieces they're playing.In addition, many of the musical bits with their animation; (which I have inevitably come across on the Internet) are really so much more impact-full in context. More time and attention seems to be given to each piece, which leads to numbers that can slowly fade in or out at the musics' pace-unhurried.There are a lot of moments throughout that will make someone familiar with the 40's and some of its ideas laugh for sure. I also feel as if the orchestra is more connected to what they are playing; rather than being swept aside by the animation. Though, the animation is stunning. When you consider that computers and just technology surrounding film, (let alone that in everyday life,) was nowhere near it is today; it's hard not to appreciate the time and skill that it really took to create an animation: let alone a Disney Animation. So glad I watched this! Though I still recommend seeing the later 200's version as well, because there are a few breathtaking numbers to be seen within; just know that the atmosphere of the two films do differ some."], ["amazing movie ,a work of art", "Long time since i have seen a movie that has made me feel like i vas lost in in it ,it amazing its like seeing music visually dancing when its playing ,like it came to life in front of your eyes it like beautiful dream you don't want too wake up from ,there is nun like it that has bin made since fantasia ,it is the most fantastic movie ever made ,im lucky too one it on DVD ;)0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A standout in animation.

Instead of doing the typical fairy tale coming to life on the screen that Disney was known for, Fantasia is a collection of multiple shorts set to classical pieces of music. None of these shorts are connected in any way (asides from them being made by Disney) so you're essentially getting eight stories for the price of one. I personally have mixed feelings on the film, and I don't think I'm the only one. It's Disney's most experimental film to date and to some it's just not their thing. To put it bluntly, for anyone going in expecting something akin to Pinocchio or Snow White, don't. This is nothing like any other Disney film out there (except for maybe its 2000 sequel). The music and animation are amazing, but that's a given when you're talking about a Disney film. The shorts and their content vary greatly, but my personal favorite is Night on Bald Mountain just because of how not Disney it feels. It's basically a horror musical, and it's great. The design for Chernabog (basically Satan) is simple, yet effective in being nightmare fuel for children. I honestly have no idea how his inclusion got the green light seeing how family friendly the rest of the shorts are in comparison. But I personally think the collection is better for it, because the other shorts, while visually interesting, just don't do it for me. The Sorcerer's Apprentice acted as an attempt to make Mickey Mouse more popular again, and I'd say it's probably my second favorite of the shorts. The story here is simple: Mickey starts messing around with his boss' magical artifacts and it eventually gets out of control. I will say this one has more \"wow\" factor than Night on Bald Mountain with what the animators decided to do visually, but again, it's also not extremely interesting to me. While I don't think Fantasia is for me, I will acknowledge how it was expertly crafted and a bold departure from what people were used to seeing from Disney at the time. I also think the songs meshed really well with the animations, so I'll give it props for that as well. If you're looking for something a little weird and wildly different from other animated movies out there, or you're just into classical music that's accompanied by interesting visuals, Fantasia is probably your best bet."], ["Reliving My Childhood", "First class animation by Disney.

Yet when I watched it last night I grew restless during some segments, particularly \"The Pastoral Symphony\" and \"Dance of the Hours,\" both of which feel too long. The dull, flat live action introductions, featuring a stuffy and overly dry Deems Taylor, stop the film cold. I found myself wishing Walt Disney had simply used title cards with a brief summary, which would have made it shorter and sweeter. Having said that, \"Fantasia\" is certainly one of Disney's most stunning, ambitious, and, for its time, daring achievements. The dual closing segment, \"Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria\" is the strongest and darkest one, with \"Rite of Spring,\" and \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" a close second and third, respectively. Oddly enough, I've enjoyed \"Fantasia 2000,\" though less ambitious and more commercial, more on repeat viewings.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Best animated film there is", "I was so excited to see that this was on the film list for cinema class because I love Disney movies, and Fantasia was a really great one that I have not seen in a really long time, so I was glad I got the excuse to watch it again.

But it was a fiasco in its original theatre release, widely considered too avant-garde for family audience then, only later revival from re-runs rescues its reputation and gives justice to the talents involved, each piece differs in its visual technique, in retrospective, they are rudimentary 2D prototypes, but in the core, it is their unbridled imagination that stuns us,The seven programs (in total eight pieces whereas Mussorgsky's NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN and Schubert's AVE MARIA are fused into one), visually run the full gamut from the abstract patterns (Bach's TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D MINOR); follows by a seasonal alteration with ballet dances based on Tchaikovsky's NUTCRACKER SUITE; then a mesmerising lesson learnt by Mickey Mouse in Paul Dukas' THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE; next one is the awe-inspiring chronicle from Earth's beginnings to the extinction of dinosaurs (Stravinsky's RITE OF SPRING), which includes a battle sequence of a T-Rex slaughtering a stegosaur, quite candid with brutality in the animal world, which is my personal pick in the miscellany; after the intermission, in Beethoven's THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, we are ushering to explore the mythological world of centaurs, fauns, cupids and Gods like Bacchus and Zeus himself; next in line is an upbeat ballet (Ponchielli's DANCE OF THE HOURS), four groups of animals, ostriches, hippos, elephants and alligators represent four different time of a day, eventually gyrate together in ludicrous jolliness; the final chapter is the said NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN and AVE MARIA combination, the darkest, scariest one, with Chernabog summoning evil spirits from graves to a night of revelry, only retreated by the church bell in the dusk when a congregation of monks march towards a ruined cathedral, wraps up a two-hour optic and aural feast in solemn peace and tranquility.A belated sequel comes almost 60 years later, which self-betrays the concerns of its commercial prospect from the executive level, the 1999 version runs in a succinct 75 minutes (against the original's 120 running length), comprised of eight segments (seven new pieces plus the original THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE), where each is presented by well- known celebrities, unfortunately it bombed in the box-office too, so clearly the running length is not the crux, what one might find lacking is the innovation, since Disney has reached its creative height in the 1990s after BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (1991), ALADDIN (1992), THE LION KING (1994), etc., the updated FANTASIA is enchanting for sure, my favourite is George Gershwin's RHAPSODE IN BLUE, where a caricature of different characters in NYC in the 1930s is given simplistic beauty and ingenuity, but paralleled with the 1940 version, the leap-of -progress of six decades is not so perceivable, as THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE can comfortably hide its age with the new additions, the traditional way of technique prevails, as excellent as each episode is, exuding their different vibrancy in coherence with the orchestration, it simply cannot overshadow its aged predecessor's glory, although both Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are heading a piece in this picture, and narratives are strong in this version (at least 4 out 8 depicts a story with suspense).Will there ever be a third venture into this unique format?

I saw this picture for the first time when my 2 daughters were in grade school, back in 1992 and I thought it had recently been released. I find the fact that this was made in 1940 astonishing and I believe it deserves the highest praise because of that! The compositional pieces accompanied by brilliantly colored, animated, abstract scenery just increases my admiration for this film. The Philadelphia orchestra tuning up, Mickey's reactions and the wonderful sound quality make this a movie for the ages and I can say that because my grandchildren are now watching it and hopefully instilling in them a life long love of classical music.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Beautiful animated music film", "Some people may find this movie to be boring because there is little to no dialog, and it doesn't have much of a story, but it is a classic motion picture, and I love it. The music accompanies the animation in such a beautiful way, and the animation is so cool, the part with the dragon is my favorite. The part with Mickey and the broomsticks is the most memorable sequence for most because he's the mascot for Disney. If you want to relax and listen to music while watching something, this is a fantastic movie. You don't even need to be a fan of classical music because the cartoons flow seamlessly with the music.

Each segment has its own orchestral piece or suite, composed from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic and Contemporary Periods, including pieces from composers such as Bach, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Stravinsky and Mussorgsky. The music is rich and dynamic and the animation sequences are bright, colorful and scenic. At times, you could see the silhouettes of Stokowski and the orchestra, letting viewers see the people behind the musical magic.My favorite sequences are the Nutcracker Suite and the Night on Bald Mountain. You could see dancing flowers and mushrooms and falling leaves and snowflakes during the Nutcracker sequence, looking very carefree and innocent. And, you could see a demon and spirits performing in some sort of sabbath in the Bald Mountain sequence - very powerful and eerie.One of Mickey Mouse's most familiar public trademarks has him in a robe wearing a sorcerer's hat (with stars and moon images on it). This first came from the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence, where this trademark was introduced.If you are looking for a Disney fairytale with a story to follow, you would not find it in this movie. However, if you enjoy classical music, anthologies and Disney animation in general, this film is for you.Grade A"], ["The epitome of the animated musical genre!", "Back when this film was made there were two broad schools of thought on animated films. One school believed that the animated action was the main point of an animated film and that the music should fit the animation. Sadly, this is how almost all animation is done today. The other school believed that the music should be the main focus and that the animation should enhance the music by providing an artistic visual representation. This is the school that \"Fantasia\" represents.I love this film and have watched it (or at least listened to it) countless times. The musical selections are among the best that classical music has to offer, and the animation and styling of the characters are classical Disney at its best. The scenes depicted vary from the hilarious to the terrifying to the awe-inspiring. Most satisfying are those that take your breath away and hold you in fascination with their beauty and elegance.My only complaint about the film is Disney's choice of Leopold Stokowski as conductor. Stokowski arrogantly took it upon himself to \"improve\" Mussorgsky's \"Night on Bare Mountain,\" and effectively ruined the best parts of the score. Compare Stokowski's version with the original and you'll see what I mean. But with the exception of Stokowski's occasional interference, \"Fantasia\" is the best animated musical film ever produced."], ["3rd out of 5 in the Golden Era", "Fantasia was released in the same year as Pinocchio (1940), but this film was released 9 months later in November.This film has he perfect amount of classical music, breathtaking animation, and memorable shorts to make the best package film ever made.Even though this film is 2 hours long, it does not feel that way, as you are just enjoying the shorts, which will go by so quickly.The best and the most iconic short in the film was \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". This is the one where Mickey tests out his master's tricks. The other shorts like \"Rite of Spring\", \"Nutcracker Suite\" and the others hold up as well.The children will enjoy the pretty animation and colours, while the adults will like the music and substance.

Leopold Stowkowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra give us the music to fit to the beautiful pictures.The film was originally intended to be released each year (as a roadshow film) thereafter with different scenes intact as well as some old ones. This was not the case when WWII broke out and the US got involved. Walt Disney's vision would not be complete until \"Fantasia 2000\" was released in 1999.Probably the most important and proclaimed piece of \"Fantasia\" would be The Sorcerer's Apprentice starring Mickey Mouse. In fact, this sequence was reused in the sequel film in 1999 to achieve the roadshow feel that Disney wanted. It was also this sequence in the film that spawned another film in 2010 starring Nicolas Cage, \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\" A wonderful film and one that will delve into your imagination and take you places you thought you may never see."], ["The Ultimate Adult Fantasy!", "I am a person who consider Art, or rich Art, being able to elevate our minds and from which we are able to draw huge amount of information. Fantasia is not only a unique film, its also the only film which with musical pieces illustrates evolution at work and prehistoric scenes pretty scary and violent with the last groups of dinosaurs parading towards doom. Development and Extermination. Also, here you have sceneries of the Hellenian mythological world portraying the mating ritual and the Bacchus celebration, \"sex, drugs and party!\", and the battle between the light and the shadow world - the world of death and decay and that of light and peace. We get the living Nature in its transgressions through the different seasons, comical portraits of animals and veggies impersonating humans, and a moral tale of a young who forgot that he is not the tutor yet, etc. The basic thread of the movie is the music of course! To begin the film with J S Bach's Toccata and Fuge in d minor, is not only supercool, but is the perfect upwarming piece. As the music itself is pretty impossible to create a simple visual story with characters from, the visuals we see are closer to abstract and expressionism in form, with natural elements to illustrate Bach's famous cosmic flow of his fugues!Walt Disney was so serious with this project, that a psychological consult with experience of peyote, was hired to give guide lines to the different segments, not to mention all the ideas which came from the big crowd of artists that was working with the pictures and the translation of the music into pictures. Just like other Disney films of the period, like Three Caballeros 1946 and certain scenes in Dumbo and others, could easily be placed side by side with Yellow Submarine and experimental underground shorts in the late 60's, in a period when LSD, Psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis was the inspiration, for both young hippies and soul searching intellectuals. Disney was really psychedelic!The imagination at work in this film is so rich, that one can view it over and over again, to find details as well as new interpretations to the different segments. When viewing this multi artwork from beginning to end, through the music to the visuals and its themes, it seems to encompass the human and natural world on Earth,in a trancendental way, so it seems to be the perfect movie to send with a probe out into outer space, hoping to encounter an alien species, who might be able to watch it! They would not only consider it a colorful gem, but would find the film be a treasure for understanding Humans from the planet Earth. Of course, I am exaggerating, but still, if NASA could pack a satellite with chosen music, which I know they had, why not a movie?Anyways, this is a way for me to say, that Fantasia, as the film looks, could not have been made today, as the most powerful film companies would not bet a huge some of money on a project like this. Also, a feature film, all drawn and painted by hand, gives a decidedly more impressive look than one that is made in a computer. The fact is, that around 1939 - 1940, in the midst of Second World War, some of the most popular, hailed by critics and audience alike, greatest films were made. If the time consuming, painstaking efforts behind Pinoccio, Wizard of Oz, The Thief of Bagdad and Fantasia all are made to be true fantasy films, they seem to tell us that during war time it better works to make \"timeless\" films. In other words, films which not occupy themselves with the ever changing societies of Humanity and the issues of the times in which they were made. Instead, and this is what make them work as true art, they seem to speak to us, in matter of symbols, archetypes and themes which have been with us through the history of time. It could be seen as a work of a great shaman, who wants to remind us about the most important and utterly most sublimely beautiful things we have on this Earth. The Greatest Movie Achievement Ever In History!I only give full points (10/10) to films that are more than a film!"], ["The Best Disney Music Video Of All Time", "All right, it can get better titles than that. But at least that's one thing we can all agree on about 'Fantasia.' 'Fantasia' was Disney's second or third movie, and thus stems from the time it churned out actual quality, not just cheap genre-spoofs like it does today. At the time, Disney was not just the *best* animation studio, it was the *only* one. Even then, Fantasia is the most ambitious Disney project from that era - rather than just translate old Mother Goose and Grimm works, the limitless imaginations of the Disney animators were going to translate famous pieces of music.So what this boils down to is a head-on of two art forms: the movie and the music. And who wins? The movie, by far. It's far more entertaining to watch Fantasia than to actually go to the symphony.Why? Well, it's simple: 'Fantasia' is a trip to the symphony, but when you go on the trip, you borrow the mind of a true music fan with boundless, colorful imagination. This is way better than anything your head could cook up for these songs.That's not the only reason, either: The songs are performed perfectly, and the announcer/composer is the perfect guide through this strange and fantastical world. And the animation is arguably the best of any movie. Literally, any frame from this movie is worthy of being hung up in an art museum. It is that quality.That's basically what 'Fantasia' is: a two-hour night at the symphony, with illustrations. It has no plot, no recognizable characters, no dialog, none of the conventions of a regular movie, and yet it overcomes all of this. I mean, there is just a handful of movies out there as original as 'Fantasia.' This is really something special.The best segments, in my opinion (everybody has their own favorites), are 'Toccotta and Fugue,' 'The Rite of Spring,' and 'Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria.'"], ["Walt Disney's Magnum Opus", "Fantasia is not the kind of movie that has a coherent plot or features a battle of good versus evil. It's an experience movie. It's a movie that reacts to classical music and changes it's tone to fit it.The film is basically The Philadelphia Orchestra performing various classical pieces(The Rite of Spring, The Pastoral Symphony etc.). But the pieces are set to animation from the Walt Disney Company. The animation is some of the best Disney has ever done.There are some pieces like Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor and The Nutcracker Suite that are just random events happening one after the other. While others like The Rite of Spring or Dance of the Hours have a sort of plot. There never is a main character or real plot in any of the stories. Except one.Possibly the most famous bit of the film is The Sorcerer's Apprentice starring Mickey Mouse. He takes his master's hat and starts enchanting the brooms to do his work for him. This... doesn't end well. This is the only original music composed for the film and it is by far one of the best appearances of Mickey Mouse.But by far my favorite scene is the end. Night on Bald Mountain depicts a demon on top of a mountain summoning the dead and damned to dance and party around him atop his mountain. He casts a few into the pit, transforms them into beasts and demons and does it only for laughs. But he is eventually driven back into slumber by the church bells and the film closes on a procession of priests through a forest. All mixed with Ave Maria. This ending is one of the strongest endings to a film I've ever seen, animated or otherwise.Fantasia isn't just a film, it's an art. The visuals are magnificent, the score is beautiful and it is really one of the best animated films to ever be conceived. If you haven't seen this amazing movie I definitely recommend it. While you may not come out of it with the same feelings I have, it is a must see for any fan of Disney or animation."], ["A classic for years to come", "Fantasia remains one of the most influential films ever made, plus one of the best Disney films ever.

Almost each of the segments were brilliant, but only 3 stood out for me. First off, who could ever forget \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", easily the best performance by the one and only Mickey Mouse. Secondly, \"The Dance of the Hours\", Lolz. Thirdly, the chilling \"Night on Bald Mountain\", with some of the best animation of the entire film.

From Mickey Mouse as the mischievous and rather comical \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" to the scary and strong imagery of demons in \"Night on Bald Mountain\", it is all spectacular. This movie maybe over sixty years old, but I have to say that this is among the masterworks of animation not only of Walt Disney, but of everything else.I have to admit though that the \"Rites of Spring\", the life and destruction of the dinosaurs is rather dull and almost never-ending (since the piece is over 20 minutes long).

Those might apply to some of the experimental work nowadays.But would you expect that one of the first avant-garde works would come from Disney?? The thought is surprising, but it's true! \"Fantasia\" is vastly different from anything made before its time, and it's still vastly different from anything made after its time. Disney would never make a film so daringly inventive nowadays.This film is a gem. From its mesmerizing cinematography during Bach's \"Tocatta & Fugue\" to the comical storyline in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" to the idyllic animation in Beethoven's \"Pastoral Symphony\" and all the way to the finale with \"Night on Bald Mountain\", this movie charms the viewer. This may be early animation, but the way it's put together allows it to compete in quality with even the most dazzling effects that modern computer animation can accomplish.However, although it bears the name of Disney, \"Fantasia\" is not for kids. I tried to watch this movie at least 4 times as a youngster, but I wasn't able to get all the way through it until recently, at the age of 17. This movie requires a level of patience that most kids (and some adults even) don't possess. I'll put it this way: if you liked \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (which also has vast tracks of pictures put to music without dialogue), then you're good to go on this movie.

Most of the stories with classical music are absolutely beautiful and completely magical, which is why I like this film. Some other people will find all the stories boring, but they are simply classics and masterpieces in Disney. Here is a list of all the story pieces with their music accompanies:Johaan Sebastastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor: Fantasia begins with this portrayal of what may pass through your mind when you hear music. When the music first plays, you see the large orchestra away at their instruments. As it goes onto cartoon, you see many different shapes, colours and movements. Whether this would pass through your mind or not when you listen to music, this story, to begin, is very beautiful and well animated.Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker ,Part 1: This is the first part of the Nutracker, each one very short and showing a little story, all the parts are related. This part shows fairies in the night decorating flowers. Nice animation and music, but that is pretty much it. 6 and a half/10. Part 2: This part shows toadstalls dancing and is probably the most noticeable of the Nutcracker parts. The music here is pleasant and the toadstalls are entertaining, resembling Chinese people. 7/10 Part 3: Possibly the most mediocre of the Nutcracker parts, here flowers in water dance and there is one white flower that dances about the most. There is nothing really special about this story at all. It is not even that beautiful. Frankly I am not sure why the Disney company bothered. 5/10. Part 4: Other people will certainly think otherwise, but this is almost definitely my favourite Fantasia story. It shows fish in a river and has very beautiful animation and the situation under the water feels very interesting and surreal. The music is also very good here, but it does not seem to be very popular compared to some other parts of the Nutcracker. Well worth it for me. 10/10 Part 5: Also noticeable and very jolly, is this part of the Nutcracker. It shows flowers dancing, resembling Russian people. The animation is very interesting and so is the music. It is possibly a bit too short. 7/10 Part 6: A rather well-known part of Nutcracker in Fantasia, this one features fairies creating autumn, then spring. The animation and music are very beautiful here and the colours are well-portrayed for the seasons shown. 8/10Paul Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice: The most famous of all the Fantasia pieces, this one starrs the ever famous Mickey Mouse wtih his sorcerer's hat - trying to do magic - but not managing very well. I personally do not find this as good as it could be, but Mickey Mouse has a bright personality and this makes the story bearable. 7/10Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring: This has been transformed into a portrayal of the ancient world - the forming of the earth, the first creatures on earth and dinosaurs. Personally this is my third favourite of all the stories. The animation, the music and the modern (of that time) portrayal of ancient earth. 9/10.Meet the Soundtrack: This is a sweet little introduction of the person whom we all know well - the Soundtrack! As we meet him, portrayed as a line, he performs different pieces of instruments and forms into many different shapes and colours. The meeting is very pleasant, nice and relaxing - not really a story. 9/10Ludwig van Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony: This story shows many different creatures (none of them entirely human) in a mythical world, resembling Greek Mythology. The music, colours and plot are very interesting, bright and mythical. This piece has a very \"Disney childish\" feeling to it, unlike any of the other stories. Well worth watching. 8/10Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours: Also showing a slight \"Disney Childish\" style, is this story - featuring dancing ostriches, hippopotami, elephants and crocodiles doing ballet. The plot is not very structured, but it does not spoil this piece. This story is very light and silly. 7/10Modest Mussorgy's Night on Bald Mountain: This is my personal least favourite story in Fantasia as, because of the devil, it is very disturbing. The piece of music chosen helps with this scariness of the story, but it is really the animation that makes this story so terrifying. Funnily enough, this is one of the most well-known stories of Fantasia, among with, of course, The Sorcerer's Apprentice. I personally think that the music is very good. 3/10Franz Schubert's Ave Maria: This story is my second favourite Fantasia story. It comes right after Night on Bald Mountain and shows, in fabulous animated detail, who look like nuns going into church through a forest. The music and forest make this slow but incredible piece worthwhile. The opera is incredibly beautiful and so is the last five minutes of the story, which is very emotional.I recommend this to anyone who respects classical music and enjoys Disney.

It let us know that someone could take the notes and put them into a form accessible to all of us. Something that elementary teachers tried to do with \"Peter and the Wolf.\" I know a couple of the pieces seem a little dated now, but collaborating with a a great conductor, Stokowski, brings this to us with great love.

Shadows of musicians walking to their seats onstage cross the screen. The sounds of the orchestra warming up grow louder...then fall silent. The narrator walks on. And so \"Fantasia\" begins.Having two musicians for parents, I grew up watching this movie. It's hard to remember that this is actually quite an old Disney film--my grandmother remembers its debut. She and I are both of the opinion that \"Fantasia\" is a movie unlike any other, and still far ahead of its time, even generations after its release. I feel that perhaps the greatest asset of this film is introducing classical music to the public in a form that young children and adults alike can enjoy and get involved in.\"Fantasia\" involves eight very famous pieces of music, each one set to a backdrop of differing and engaging animations. Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' is an excellent opening: it is the oldest piece of music in the film, and the animation consists of abstract visions that coincide with the music beautifully. This is the only purely abstract animation of the entire film, with the exception of the modest Soundtrack character that appears later, which introduces various instruments in the orchestra.The orchestra itself is often seen during the film, the musicians backlit with various colored lights, or their instruments spotlighted. The musicians themselves remain in the dark; even their conductor, the great Stokowski, is never seen in the light. We are forced to sit still and concentrate on the sounds that are made--a skill which many people today have not developed. However, even these people are riveted to the simplicity of the orchestra scenes, and even moreso to the animated sequences.The show continues with Tchaikovsky's famous (or infamous) 'Nutcracker Suite', where each dance is represented by different figures ranging from fancy goldfish to fairies to walking flowers. Then comes perhaps the most well-known part of the film: Dukas' 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'. This is the only section of the film where a Disney character (Mickey Mouse) appears, as the title character. He learns the folly in pride when a magical spell goes horribly wrong and floods his master's castle.Stravinsky's 'The Rite of Spring' is a tale of the origin of life, and the epic battles of dinosaurs. It begins alone in space, with only a few stars and a bassoon's tune for company. It quickly moves to scenes of early earth, and simple ocean-dwelling creatures. Later, the dinosaurs take over, finally dying out when the earth's water supply disappears. While some of the science may be outdated by today's standards, it is still a spectacular piece of work that includes fairly realistic dinosaurs--a step away from Disney's habit of 'cutesy'ing animals.This solemn music is followed by the rambunctious ballet 'Dance of the Hours' by Ponchielli, where ostriches, elephants, and hippos dance, and are courted by excitable alligators. This one scene elicits the most smiles from its viewers out of the whole movie. The whole setting is like that of a real, staged ballet...the only difference being that unexpected animals perform the roles.The last animation of the film is actually a melding of two very different pieces: the nearly demonic 'A Night on Bald Mountain', by Mussourgsky, and the sacred piece by Schubert, 'Ave Maria'. While Chernobog, the demon from Bald Mountain, can be scary to young children, 'Ave Maria' offers relief with its soothing scenes of mountains and forests, and worshipers walking calmly through the early-morning light.\"Fantasia\" remains one of my favorite films, and a testament to the amazing skills of the Disney animators who worked on it over 60 years ago. While modern copies of the movie tend to warp the sound, it is not to the extent that the overall experience is lessened. I DEFINITELY recommend this movie for everyone--especially those who think that classical music is boring and stodgy."], ["Nothing ever like it - either before or since", "No other movie ever had so much detail put into it.With \"Fantasia\" full of glimmering dewdrops, exploding stars, cascading water, writing ghouls and Satan-by-moonlight, the average rate of exposure for each frame of this ambitious film is 2.5.In addition to all this, to adequately convey both the sound and the feeling of an orchestra in a symphonic hall, Disney had his sound engineers design \"Fanta-Sound\", an elaborate multi-channel stereo system, the likes of which was probably never surpassed until the age of digitization.Innovation after innovation (like extensive use of the multi-plane camera) shows up in \"Fantasia\".Still amazing audiences after all these years, this film is the Rock of Gibraltar among Disney's cinematic milestones - and a major achievement in the history of movies.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["This film introduced me to classical music", "I've seen Fantasia about two times, both times when I was a young girl.

In fact, I wish the new short Destino could somehow be added to a future Fantasia update, since it was probably originally intended for one, along with Clair de Lune, which was cut from the original because of time limits, but is only available in its restored form in the deluxe Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 version, which is way too expensive for me. I would love to see what Disney (under Roy Disney, hopefully) would do with Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition; that could be a group of artists' tour de force.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["The Path Not Taken", "In 1940, animation was still in infancy. Before -Fantasia- the usual view of animation was that it could be anything other than high art. It could be effective for entertainments for children, suitable at best for use in fairy-tale stories. To be sure, -Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs- got some respect, but could animation be art for its own sake? Could it have appeal without forcing one to revert to childhood?In a time of great movies, -Fantasia- had severe competition, and it created difficulties in presentation, most notably for the sound system necessary for showing this feature to its fullest effect. Today that is no problem; the home stereo and DVD or VHS player and home theater system serve adequately. In the early 1940s the expense of a sound system for the music alone was a BIG problem.-Fantasia- succeeds as art for its own sake. The \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" sequence sets one up for the contrast between realism, representation, and abstraction. The music may be hackneyed, but the visuals begin with something predictable (silhouettes of musicians, as) in the Toccata, only to lead to visual variations largely exploiting partial views of stringed instruments, their bows, and the fingerpads of flutes against odd landscapes.Music from Tchaikovsky's -Nutcracker- is used in a ballet, but one very different from the ballet that we see around Christmas. The dancers are fairies that force the changes of season and creatures of nature. The fairies bring spring plants to life. The dancing mushrooms are fluff, but the goldfish give a subdued, yet seductive dance. Thistles that we might despise in nature form a chorus line that daffodils join -- very impressively. Then the change of seasons from summer to fall is shown as fairies turn the colors of leaves  (leaves turn in bunches as they do in nature where I live) and then bring the frosty chill of winter, complete with dancing snowflakes.\"Mickey Mouse\" appears as the Sorcerer's Apprentice in a cautionary tale about using great powers before one fully understands their consequences. Little need be said but that the animation gives a power to the story that no other visual treatment could give to the music.We then get a treatment in a somewhat-educational, yet still-entertaining, depiction of the creation of Earth through the downfall of the dinosaurs. \"Science\", namely Darwinian evolution, sets the stage for a surprisingly-modern view of the dinosaurs as lively (if often violent) creatures capable of emotion -- almost sixty years before the animated -Walking With Dinosaurs- treatment.Beethoven's Sixth, or \"Pastoral\" Symphony is the setting for a depiction of the fantastic creatures of Greco-Roman myth: unicorns, pegasuses, centaurs, satyrs, and gods in a mostly-delightful romp, aside from a fearsome thunderstorm from the Big Boss, Zeus.Disney gives a witty treatment of the trite ballet \"Dance of the Hours\" from Ponchielli's opera -La Gioconda-, with ostriches, hippos, crocodiles, and elephants dancing in a nobleman's palace. At the end, Disney sets two pieces of music symbolizing an apocalyptic struggle between Evil (Mussorgsky's -Night on Bald Mountain-) and good (Schubert's reverential -Ave Maria-) that, although almost polar opposites in mood feed seamlessly as daybreak consigns nocturnal creatures to the netherworld where they belong.This feature should be seen in entirity because some of the images of one scene have parallels in another scene. This is the deliberate choice of one of the cultural giants of the twentieth century. For example, the dancing fish in -The Nutcracker- is recalled as an elephant blows a bubble in -The Dance of the Hours-.-Fantasia- had few imitators for decades. It was too good to imitate. Disney had ideas of replacing some of the scenes in re-releases, but that all came to naught. Animation of this sort would prove costly; moreover, World War II would create a need for propagandistic and educational materials at the expense of 'ars gratia artis'. Disney's postwar successes in more populistic animation probably kept him from making any sequels.Animation came of age in -Fantasia-  and proved its usefulness not only in childish cartoons, but also in art and education. Disney took one great step along a path from which even he was compelled to retreat. It's not for a lack of music. Much music begs for such treatment."], ["psychosis?", "I saw this movie today and actually, I liked it. Most i liked the first part, it didn't really have an actual plot, it was more like colours created by the music. It suprised me how much each tone was shown as aline, a bubble, a wave ore something else. even I, who am not especially musically tellented, could see how good the film represented the music.I more disliked the part with the greek mythology kind of story, and also the part with the evoulution. it felt kind of far-fetched.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A brilliant and progressive film and a hallmark of animation", "In 1940, Walt Disney released the ambitious film \"Fantasia,\" a marriage of classical music and (for the time) contemporary animation in an effort to expose audiences to the possibilities of animation as well as the beauty of the music presented.  A dismal failure in its initial release, \"Fantasia\" was close to being forgotten by the world, and even Walt Disney himself had distanced himself from his once beloved creation.  Subsequent re-releases, however, have exposed new and more receptive audiences to this brilliant film.\"Fantasia\" takes many well-known pieces of classical music and presents them in new and dynamic ways.  While some work better than others, none of them falls below a very high standard of quality.  By today's standards, the animation could be considered crude and the images simplistic, but all of the CGI flash in the world couldn't replace the impact some of these images maintain.Several high points dot the film.  The \"Nutcracker Suite\" is cast as a ballet of nature, with bouncing mushrooms in the \"Chinese Dance\" and tiny faeries spreading dew across the awakening world in \"The Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy.\"  \"The Dance Of The Hours\" takes a familiar, and perhaps staid, ballet piece and turns it on its ear, casting such unlikely prima ballerinas as ostriches, hippos, elephants, and a pack of menacing alligators.The crowning achievement of the film, however, is not the over-played \"Sorceror's Apprentice,\" as many claim.  Although the music is expressive and the animation well-done, it's commonality has taken some of the dynamic that the piece once had.  No, the most striking moments come from the pairing of Mussorgsky's menacing \"Night On Bald Mountain\" and Schubert's celestial \"Ave Maria.\"\"Night On Bald Mountain\" marks an undeniably mature moment in the Disney universe.  In this piece, Tchernabog, an ancient god of evil (although he is associated with the Christian Devil in the film) summons his followers to Bald Mountain, where all manor of demons, wicked spirits, and imps cavort in his unholy presence.  But as powerful as he may be, even the mighty god trembles before the power of the dawn, and with the church bells, his revelry is finished and the world sanctifies itself to the \"Ave Maria\", one of the most beautifully pure pieces ever composed (at least in this reviewer's opinion).As with all other Disney films, \"Fantasia\" is subject to the whims and fancies of the Disney marketing department, who infamously take titles out of production for years on end in an effort to build up consumer demand. Should \"Fantasia\" ever come to a theatre near you, do not hesitate to see it.  Should you be lucky enough to find a copy to purchase, do so.

I personally don't like the \"Rite of Spring\" segment, but that's fine-it's allowed one bad segment, and the \"Nutcracker\" and \"Pastoral Symphony\" more than compensate.  I also love how the narrator gives background on the music and the animation but isn't a well-known actor.  (Perceptive readers can probably guess that this was my biggest gripe with Fantasia 2000.)

For a masterpiece it truly is , a one-of-a -kind, oddball array of eight short features that depict in cartoon form a \"story\" to illustrate a popular work of classical music. Ever since its initial release in1940, music critics have generally scoffed at the film, deploring the act of illustrating a composer's work. Public reaction to the picture has varied widely, from wild applause to total apathy. Lacking a cohesive \"beginning to end\" storyline , the film seems to be geared more toward adults than children. The sequences are strung together by a very dry commentary narrated by DeemsTaylor. These introductory notes set up a brief explanation of what is to come, coupled with an anecdote about each specific composer. Although each segment is fascinating (and beautifully drawn), there are four standouts : the \"Nutcracker Suite\" is a sheer delight, featuring fairies dropping dewdrops on cobwebs and in a later section, mushrooms dancing as Chinese men ; Mickey Mouse as Dukas's \"the Sorcerer's Apprentice wherein the famous little guy gets in over his head using magical powers ; the uproarious \"Dance of the Hours\" in which a company of crocodiles,elephants and hippopotamus divinely bounce, leap and pirouette in front, around and behind Grecian columns ; and finally Schubert's \"Ave Maria, depicted as a calming aftermath to the frightening \"Night on Bald Mountain\" by Mussorgsky. FANTASIA is not a perfect film. It's very structure makes it difficult for some people to sit through all the way. It has its longueurs. But it also has some of the most inspired and gorgeous animation you'll ever see, and thanks to Mickey Mouse and Meastro Leopold Stowkowski, along with Disney's brilliant craftsmen, FANTASIA remains an indispensable work of motion picture art."], ["inspiring", "One of the few good things about \"Fantasia 2000\" is that after I saw it, it compelled me to dig out the original Fantasia and watch it again. I fell in love with it all over again. When I first saw it in 1990 at its theatrical re-release, I was only 8 years old. Ten years later, in 2000, I had taken up the violin and I was about to graduate from high school. Watching this film with a new appreciation for classical music that I didn't have in 1990, this film inspired me to stick with the violin and pursue a music major. Another thing that changed when I watched it again in 2000, was my view on the final segment, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. Today it is my favorite segment of Fantasia. Fantasia's presentation of \"Ave Maria\" is one of the most spiritually uplifting endings in the history of cinema. The music in this segment is just gorgeous. It showed me that music can have an impact and that it is just as important as any other form of entertainment.Of coarse, it wouldn't be fair not to list some of the other highlights of this film. Highlights include J.S. Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D minor\" which shows off the orchestra and then dissolves into an abstract dream with flashes of light and flying bows and quaking landscapes, Beethoven's \"Pastoral symphony\" which is a pretty accurate perception of Greek Mythology, except for the centaurettes. Those are purely Disney's idea. Then we have \"The Dance of the Hours\" Fantasia's funniest and second-most famous (next to the `Sorcerer's Apprentice') this segment features dancing hippos, elephants, ostriches and alligators throughout the coarse of a day from morning to the afternoon, then into the evening and night.

I could not imagine what manner of person could look at a plant and think it looks like a person, or create a ballet danced by the four creatures on the planet who are most ill-adapted for dancing. There are certain parts in the film which are not what you would associate with a film viewed by children, because they are the sort of thing that may give some people nightmares, but nobody took much notice about things like that in 1940-at that time they had more pressing matters to worry about.

Many exhilarating moments when images and music explode on the screen, several really magical spots with incredibly good animation, like the dancing of the mushrooms and flowers, but the last few minutes of it are uninteresting and drag quite a bit. Far from FANTASIA's worst, though. ***3rd segment: the best known --and arguably best-- segment of the film. It's the famous segment with Mickey Mouse as a sorcerer's apprentice. Magical animation, excitement, great music, and a classic bit where he's dreaming of shooting around stars and rising waves with his powers. Only complaint: it could've been longer (it's probably the film's shortest sequence). ****4th segment: stunning representation of Earth in its very prime, this is the one that has haunted by mental projection of our planet in its first millennia. Fantastic music and wonderfully drawn dinosaurs too. Great detail in the volcanoes, lava, and environment.

Set in mythological environments, this lengthy chapter has unicorns, centaurs, Zeus launching thunder bolts, rainbows, and lots more. Some really good moments, but lots of boring ones as well. Music is nothing exceptional, but the segment is surely worth seeing. ***6th segment: another uneven segment, I would put this one in more or less the same league as the previous one.

Though one might assume that this is a film for children, it really knows no age, and it is just as enjoyable for adults. The combination of beautiful classical music led by renowned conductor Leopold Stokowski, and amazing animations from the Disney team is a banquet for the senses.What is so amazing about this film is how far ahead of its time it was. Disney had already pioneered the concept of bringing classical music to children with `Silly Symphonies' which were animated shorts set to familiar classical pieces.  He had developed the Multiplane camera, which allowed animations to appear as if they had depth.  He had assembled an enormous team of animators and redefined the industry.  Everything was in place for a chance meeting with Leopold Stokowski that flowered into a collaboration of obsessive geniuses that would become Fantasia.Fantasia really consists of a series of enchanting animated shorts, each adapted to a particular piece of classical music.  There are free form abstract interpretations like the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (Johann Sebastian Bach), a Mickey Mouse version of the Sorcerer's Apprentice (Paul Dukas), and interpretive pieces such as the Pastoral Symphony (Ludwig van Beethoven) and the Nutracker Suite (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky).  The selection of the music and the animators' perfect synchronization of the visual images produces a magical and seamless product that makes it seem that the music is written for the images rather than the other way around.Another groundbreaking concept was the sound.  Disney invented a system of multiple tracks that he called Fantasound, that placed microphones throughout the orchestra and recorded each track separately.  The theaters were then fitted with numerous speakers all around the room that made the sound feel as if it was coming from everywhere.  With this, Disney created surround-sound fifty years before its time.  To understand what an achievement this was, one would need to understand that simple two speaker stereo hadn't yet been invented.  The DVD was re-mastered from Disney's original Fantasound soundtrack making the surround-sound spectacular.The animations were nothing short of miraculous.  There was neither digital technology nor computer graphics in 1940.  Each frame of the film had to be individually drawn by an animator.  One frame took an animator about three hours to complete and there were 24 frames per second.  That meant that each second of the film required three full days of labor to produce.  The work necessary to produce the smoothly flowing images we see is mind-boggling.The DVD contains a fascinating featurette on the making of the film, including some priceless footage of Disney interviews.

It can easily top most lists of the greatest animated film as well.Of course, by today's computer generated standards, the animation seems simple. But, to watch \"Fantasia\" you have to put it into perspective: it was released in 1940 and every single frame of the film was created by hand.Obviously, there were no hi-tech methods for film creation 60 years ago. \"Fantasia\" proves that low-tech can still be amazing.Warner Brothers was creating low-tech animation at the same time. As a matter of fact, 1940 saw the birth of Bugs Bunny. But, \"Fantasia\" easily shows that Walt Disney was the animation master of his time.Even within Mr. Disney's lifetime, (he died in 1966) there would be fancier and more beautiful pictures. Look at \"Sleeping Beauty.\" However, if you keep in mind the era in which \"Fantasia\" was made, and the state-of-the-art at the time, you can appreciate Disney's work even more.Films like \"Fantasia\" were stepping stones for Disney that led to greatness like \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", and others.Look at the innovation that Disney used. For example, in 1940, he had the soundtrack RECORDED IN STEREO! Practically every theater in the United States was unequipped to present it sufficiently.I bought my video of \"Fantasia\" in 1991. But, for the true Disney fan, the DVD is a MUST!I give an absolute, 100% recommendation to it.

But let's stop a minute to think about when this film came out: it was 1940. Fast food didn't exist, color movies were not universal, and toy marketing tie-ins weren't necessary to support crappy movie plots. Walt Disney, God rest his soul, went and made his 2nd feature film... a long-form full-length music video! 41 years before MTV began broadcasting!But enough with contextual social history. The animation in Fantasia is now 60 years old. It's not perfect; frankly it looks grainy and old compared to Fantasia 2000. However, the imperfections in the film's animation give evidence to its artistry: the animators of this film were human beings not Macs or Sparcstations. Now, I'm a big Lucas fan and I'm all for CGI work and digitally inserted characters... but my heart bows in awe to the color texturing and attention to detail that jumps off the screen at you when you see this film!And now, for the other star of Fantasia after its animation staff: its MUSIC. Whoever chose the music, chose very very very well.I was never a big fan of Tchaikovsky... but the Arabian Dance sequence alone, converted me to liking his music. The sequencing of Mussorgsky and Schubert is truly a yin-yang tour de force of musical history and more than makes up for the singular disappointment I have with almost all things Stravinsky [see my review of Fantasia 2000 for the exception!]. Beethoven, Dukas, Ponchielli... all masters. And then there was one, the master of masters [I freely admit to my bias here]: good ol' JS Bach himself. All united under the banner of mouse-ears. Hats off to Disney!To sum up: the animation is old, but give it a break, it's a classic! The music is without parallel.

Initially a bomb, it took decades for it to be recognized as the work of art that it is. The animation was amazing for its time, and still holds up beautifully today.  This film was just so visually inventive and flexible, from the abstract yet completely appropriate imagery of the Bach piece in the beginning, to the epic grandeur of the creation of life on earth for Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\", to the dark and hellish feel of \"Night on Bald Mountain\".  Even throw in the giddy silliness of the dancing hippos, and the famous \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\", featuring Mickey Mouse at his best.And not to forget the music, either, which features some of the greatest pieces from composers such as Bach, Beethoven, and Tchaikofsky, my personal favorite of which was Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony.  And of course, the people behind the music- conductor Leopold Stokowski and the Philadephia orchestra- sounded completely on the mark and accomplished in their trade.And both of these aspects perfectly mesh in the 120 minutes of this film. This time, the music does not simply aid what happens onscreen, but the animation and music are accompaniments for each other.  Normally, music supplies the emotion, and visuals convey story.  Here, it's a little bit of both- the music clearly weaves part of the story itself, and the animation adds to the feeling of what's going on.  Never before have music and visuals so perfectly intertwined like in this movie."], ["The definitive animated film", "This is the one movie that anyone with even the slightest interest in either classical music or animation simply must see.  Whether or not they enjoy it will vary individually, as the film is pretty dated and drawn out. Personally I love Fantasia, but it has its share of problems.  It is not, as logic would suggest, a good movie for kids.   Fantasia is to animation what 2001 is to sci-fi movies-- the classic genre favorite that ends up boring uninitiated viewers.  There's a reason why the only images from this film that ended up permeating popular culture are Mickey's Sorcerer's Apprentice and the Night on Bald Mountain sequence at the end; those are the only two segments that entertain everyone who sees them (except the younger audience members, who'll be terrified by the satanic finale).  It's probably just because I'm a child of the short attention span '90s, but I ended up enjoying Fantasia 2000 a lot more than the original.  The new film's segments all have plots of some kind (even the triangle butterfly story at the beginning, which claims to be an abstract sequence but really isn't) and they seem to accommodate the musical selections more closely.  I still love Fantasia, and I hope Disney gives us good DVD's of both Fantasia films (think about it-- that idiotic straight-to-video Lion King sequel is on DVD but not Fantasia, or even the first Lion King movie).

We have to suffer blips and bloops twinkling across the screen as acid-trip visuals match the music that is being played (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor). Kind of like turning on the spirograph-like visuals on Windows Media Player. This is a bad way to introduce the film and it's techniques. I can only imagine the audience of the time watching it and thinking 'What the hell is this?'

The movie itself is vastly overrated, patience pushing overly-long and aimed almost purely at classical music lovers, and I can only wonder how many children (and adults) this bored to tears over the many decades. Between each unrelated segment the conductor waffles on describing the very simple story you're about to see (thanks for that) and the segments themselves are a mixed bag. The Mickey part is good, along with the dinosaurs and devil parts, but many of the others are just too dull, overly simplistic or hardly anything brilliant, and they go on for far too long. Overall it is very well made and certain parts are still impressive, but the length is overindulgent by a least half an hour and it becomes a chore to sit through, and I doubt many kids, if at all, could make it through until the bitter end without wanting to do something else.2 out of 6 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Uneven in quality; what's great is great, what is not is mediocre or weird", "Having rented a DVD and seen \"Fantasia\" for the first time in my life, I will say this: what is great in \"Fantasia\" is great, what is not great in \"Fantasia\" is mediocre or just plain weird or underdeveloped. First, let's start with the great. \"Night on Bald Mountain\" and the following \"Ave Maria\" are stunning. Those two cartoon segments should have been part of a separate movie altogether, blowing away all the contemporary \"Horror\" Manga comic stuff coming out of Japan. I never seen a cartoon before show the sides of \"Good\" and \"Evil\" in such contrasting manner, with a strong depth of spirituality. \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" is a great Mickey Mouse feature that should have been made into a separate movie. That's segment's strong messages of \"consequences\" of one's actions is outstanding. The rest? The other segments are not worth talking about, because Warners Brothers Bugs Bunny and Co. did that stuff 20 times better and with a sense of humor. In ending, the uncut version presented here, with the narration, well, let me say this, the narration is not needed, it only slowed things down."], ["Lacking in a Major Place...", "\"Fantasia\" is quite remembered as one of Disney's first ever films, and an essential of the company; from it's unique style to the beautiful animation and compositions, it's Disney's art house film. \"Fantasia\" is what most would call a classic.However, just because it's a classic, doesn't mean I'm required to love it. Don't get me wrong, when the movie succeeds, it succeeds. But when it flops, it REALLY flops.Okay, if you don't know, \"Fantasia\" is a series of animated shorts with composer segments in between, the film entirely relies on visual storytelling through the movement of the animation and classical music playing in the background.Now, that idea is simply perfect; that has great potential. But my problem with the film lays in the fact that it's all wasted, the stories have no story. It's all nonsense.The closest thing to an actual narrative are two of the short films; the Mickey Mouse one, and \"The Night on Bold Mountain\" are the closest thing to one, and even then, it isn't much.And this movie thinks sense it's a series of shorts, it doesn't need story; which far from the truth. To argue, I point at the ten minute Japanese animated short film, \"The House of Small Cubes\". Centering around an old man saves his home from tides by continually making it taller, but when he is forced to venture into flood waters, he comes to terms with his past. This film tells the personal journey of a man in both a creative way and in a short length. It's beautifully made and a perfect short. And \"Fantasia\" could have had more stories like that. While yes, the prior segments from \"Fantasia\" I mentioned have the most story, and are actually very good, they could have benefited from more of a plot.And at that, I can compare it to \"Fantasia 2000\"; by far the best short of from that film is \"Rhapsody Blue\", it tells several interwinding stories and events happening during the great depression in New York, as everybody has a simple problem (usually having to do with money), and they're able to recover by the end. The story is simple, but again, still there.Okay, another problem; the film a hard time appealing to kids. Sure, the animation segments can easily entertain a child. But what about the composer segments? These boring and unnecessary part of the film derails it completely, and it's derailed to go against the point of the film. Because the composer explains everything that happened in the film. Why? I don't know. This design makes no sense, and it honestly drives away an audience, because these segments feel like they go on forever.However, among my many criticisms I have more than a few praises, as I mentioned before, the film benefits from the animation and music; along with that, some of the segments are really good, and I do enjoy watching the film even if it has a few writing problems.\"Fantasia\" is an alright movie. I honestly believe the sequel was an improvement, but even then that still has issues. Regardless, the film is not bad in my eyes."], ["A new form of entartainment", "\"Fantasia\" (1940) is art in its absolute form - beautifully combining the visual (represented by masterfully done short clips, each of them deserving an entire film of his own) and the hearable (taken on another level by orchestral music, in an effort to present the classical music to a broader audience).

Between each short the composer explains what the next short will be about and the concept behind it and the composition.Probably the best known short is the Sorcerers Apprentice starring Mickey Mouse.

Now while there is absolutely nothing wrong with this and i love many of the classic and new Disney film released for children that is the mindset i had when i heard the title about fantasia and after watching the film i now have a different mindset. While Fantasia is a animated musical that you may assume could be directed towards a child audience i would say that this film is directed to an older audience who have a better understanding and appreciation for it. I was very impressed by the skills used in the animation of this film. It seems that those who worked on the animation of this film paid great attention to detail, and i also loved the stunning colors seen throughout this film. Overall i think this is an adorable movie with good music and amazing animation and super cute characters, although i think some parts may be to scary and slow moving for young children it is great for an older audience."], ["Fantasia", "I watched \"Fantasia\" a couple of weeks ago, and it's been on my mind a bit since. This isn't a film with a flowing narrative; it consists of a series of animations set to popular classical music. There are segments which have a little story to tell, but none flow into each other. It seems like the animators were just told to animate what they feel (if I recall, that is exactly what the host, played by Deems Taylor, says), and that is what this film seems like to me \u2013 the animator's emotions and experiences whilst listening to timeless music.Some of the segments left little to no impact on me. That is not to say that the animation in such segments wasn't stunning, as it is throughout. All were beautiful and the music is fantastic. Instead of focusing on all of the segments, I'm going to focus on those I remember most, the ones I enjoyed the most. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" based on the piece of the same name by Paul Dukas, shows Mickey Mouse (voiced by Uncle Walt himself) as the apprentice of a powerful sorcerer. The sorcerer has Mickey do chores like mop the floor and so on, while Mickey idolises his mentor to the highest degree. However, one evening when the sorcerer goes to bed, Mickey doesn't feel like filling the well with water, so he dons his mentor's hat and brings a broomstick to life, making him do all the work. However, this leads to hundreds of brooms flooding the place, and Mickey having to figure out how to stop them. The animation is beautiful, as is most done by Disney, and the timing is magnificent. It's just a fun little cartoon. It's easy to see why sorcerer Mickey is one of Disney's biggest trademarks, heck I even have a pair of the furry years ant hat from Disneyland! My favourite segments would have to be \"Rite of Spring\" and \"Dance of the Hours.\" The former is just so poignant and breathtaking, and the music just seems to match the tone the segment is trying to set. The animation, especially on the lava and water and during the t-rex attack, is just phenomenal. I have no idea how they paced this thing, but by God they did it will. It's also heartbreaking! These poor animals just drop dead! I liked these creatures; they had so much character even though they spoke nary a word! It ends on such an ambiguous note, with such subtlety and intrigue. It's just lovely. \"Dance on the Hours\" is a rather baffling affair, but my God it looks beautiful. The lighting, the colours, the designs on the animals. How did they make a hippo so graceful? I have no idea, but then again that seems to be the magic of Disney. They can make the impossible possible. The little romance between the hippo and alligator is just adorable; sometimes things can be said without uttering a word.People are going to smite me for this, but I didn't see what was so special about \"The Night on Bald Mountain.\" It's beautiful and thought provoking, the music was nice ... and that's it. The only thing massive about the last segment to me was Chernabog himself; I mean, he is the devil. The devil is one scary guy. Other than that, after all I'd heard about Bald Mountain, it just seemed underwhelming. In my opinion, \"Rite of Spring\" would've been a better finale. It's much more evocative to me.Overall, \"Fantasia\" is pretty damn good. I don't find it as amazing as other Disney fans do, but it is gorgeous to look at, and groundbreaking to boot. There is this sort of charm about it, this air of grandeur. It is worth checking out.8/10."], ["Fantasia Review", "Fantasia is an animated masterpiece. Though this film is most popularly attributed to providing us with the inception of the beloved character that is Mickey Mouse, there is much more here to appreciate. The animation of the film is executed with grace, and really catches and holds the eye for the duration. The coloring in the film is done beautifully an does not go unnoticed. The music adds to the excitement and is a masterpiece in itself when you really get down to it. Fantasia is a magically journey through the head of Walt Disney.

The idea of bringing a whole new meaning to sound both technologically (First movie in Surround Sound) and artistically was a brilliant venture. To say this Feature is not visually appealing is straight up a crime; it still holds up today with such elegant designs and vivid tones.Fantasia knows its audience. The movie really feels as if you are watching a full orchestra play in front of you and the MC treats the audience as such. There's no crude humor or blatant need to keep the viewer interested other than admiring the very fabric of what music is and how it can look, sound, and feel. Every visual is captivating and strikes well with the music. Whether it be abstract, themed, or a narrative, Fantasia takes the artistic views from so many perceptions that it's just as pleasurable to watch as it is to listen to.It's a very lengthy movie, especially for the time, and if you are not the kind of person who is very interested in music or animation, then this movie will most likely have you asleep by the Rite of Spring. I will admit, that one sometimes gets a yawn or two out of me in the beginning, but it only emphasizes how much the animation compliments the tone. When the music is soft then the animation is tame, but when the music is accented or loud, then the animation is alive and powerful. The tones can go from happy and carefree such as The Pastoral Symphony or Dance of the Hours, to vague and mysterious like The Nutcracker or Toccata and Fugue in D minor, or brash and powerful like The Rite of Spring or Night on Bald Mountain. It has a little bit for everyone.Music lover or not, this movie has a way of grabbing the attention of an audience of any age and can even spark the interest in music for anyone.

A brilliant piece of cinema that I have enjoyed again and again as a child as well as an adult. I never get over its wonder, its beauty, and its presentation. Even if Fantasia 2000 is just as good, this one holds a special place.This was when Disney had it made. This was when Disney made quality films that would not reach this kind of quality until the 90's. I didn't even re-watch this film to give this review, because I know it by heart and it is just stunning all on its own. Growing up on Disney films in general doesn't hinder my love for this film as well as many others.As a child, and an adult, I adore the Rite of Spring scene, the Pastoral Symphony, as well as the Night on Bald Mountain with the devil on the mountain. I don't remember being afraid of any of it, and I loved its color, form, and transition. I never get over it. I was--am--an animal lover and those scenes made my life as a little girl obsessed with horses, dragons, dinosaurs, fantastical creatures, and everything art. Fantasia is a fire to the imagination and a major inspiration for me as an artist.One thing though that has bothered me for a while was The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Even as a kid, I never liked it as much as I had everything else. I was never into Mickey Mouse as a character anyway (I preferred Donald and Goofy); I liked the old cartoons, but nowadays Mickey has been sugar coated beyond recognition, and he seems more like a children's cash cow more than a beloved character. He used to be so very charming, like he was in this short, but even now I can't really enjoy it as much as the other ones. It felt kind of out of place for me, simply because we have this lovely bounty of beautifully drawn Pegasus horses and devils and realistic-looking dinosaurs that are anatomically incorrect juxtaposed to modern science; and yet, even though it is their company's namesake, they add Mickey Mouse to an otherwise serious yet lighthearted picture? It is in the Disney style, sure, but I wouldn't be missing it. That sounds harsh, but it's just my personal taste. On its own, though, I like it. It's a nice story and I love the work that the company went into it. I understand why so many people loved it as a short.10 out of 10 is rarely a given, but this is something that holds an importance to me and for film in general.

Thank God for re-releasing, not to mention today's VHS & DVD's!", "The development of the animated motion picture is one of such swiftness as to only be rivaled by Aviation's rapid evolution from the Wright Brohers, 1903 through 2 World Wars. The Animated Feature evolved from the Cartoon Short Subject. It was a period of about 30 years or so from the most primitive works like 1906's HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS(1937). The animation as an art & science really made the strides, and when it was added to all of the technical achievements in film, like color, sound, etc.,we wound up with a seemingly different thing altogether.The overwhelming success of SNOW WHITE, was achieved in spite of a lot of folks in the Hollywood Establishment and The Press saying it wouldn't work and would not be a favourite at the Box Office. Insteasd of his critics getting to say, \"I told you so!\", it was old Walt who got to do his best Nelson (from THE SIMPSONS) impersonation by giving a loud and clear,\"Ha Ha!\" It has been that Mr. Disney had no musical training*, yet possessed a great sense what was \"good\", and what would be the best type or particular pre-existing songs to use in his animated cartoon shorts. Not to rely on his own layman's 'horse sense' kind of judgment, Walt sought counsel in film collaborators, the Host of Many of the Classical Music Radio Broadcasts of Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Deems Taylor. His other chief consultant in these musical matters was, no doubt, was one Mr. Leopold Stokowski who is the on and screen Conductor of his own Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra and, if I may be so bold, was quite a 'Ham' in front of the movie camera.Now the Walt Disney Studio had probably the best equipped, trained and talented group of Artists, Animators and Script Writers in the World. It was a veritable 'Animation Army' and no other company, except maybe Max & Dave Fleischer's, could even compare.So, there would be no problem with doing the stories. Once the number of segments and their lengths were determined, Walt had the horses to deliver the visuals. The animation or moving of the drawn image had already hit its peak several years earlier and the artists & animators would have benefit of such processes as Disney's Exclusive Multi-Plane camera.After the selection of the Classical Pieces to be used and adapted to each of the segments, and story lines developed and assigned to various Disney Animation Teams, it would seem that the job was just about done. Well, it just wasn't true. This greatest of Disney's projects was just getting started.The fundamental problem of 'The Concert Feature' (its working title)was one that really did not plague earlier animated films, at least not to this extent. FANTASIA was being billed as \"a completely new form of entertainment!\" It was beginning to live up to that claim.In making this Classical Music and Animated Film feature film, the Disney staff was working with two absolutes. On the one hand the fine application of the stop action photography. The other was the magnificent combination of the fine sounds of the Symphony Orchestra, which combine to give a single, beautiful feast to our auditory nerves, our hearing. This was clearly an exercise in bringing the two widely disparate sensual stimuli.So combining he two should present no new problem. After all the world has had sound movies or \"Talkies\" for some time now. There seemed to be no trouble in synchronizing the voice with the lip movement. Any problems in that area had surely been worked out long ago. Talking Pictures were nothing new, and this FANTASIA was surely no different. After all, we had already seen SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS and PINOCCHIO (1940) and they proved to be highly successful and handy at the old Box Office, to boot!But their is no great amount of 'spoken' word by the animated characters. Other than our M.C., Mr. Taylor and a brief sojourn by Mickey Mouse into the \"Real World\", there is none. The synchronization would be that of proper mood and correct movement to be coordinated with the rising and falling of the melodious sound track.Okay, let us concede that it wasn't easy, but the Disney crew did it! They brought about the on screen marriage of the sound and the imagery. But there's one problem left.The object of FANTASIA, as was so explicitly stated by Deems Taylor at the very beginning, was to present the audience with images and stories that were conjured up by the Disney Artists. The story segments would be, in many cases, far different from those of the Composers' original intents. Well, we concede that they succeeded.But there remains one major problem. In the process of making this 'Concert Feature', the production staff was essentially blending opposites in the Symphonic Score with the Bright and Beautiful Moving Images. They succeeded in combining Fire and Water, representing the two elements.But what about the other element, one that these various musicians and scribblers had no control over. And this element is at least as strong as the Images and Music. It is the Power of Imagination, not that of the Creative Team, but that of the Movie Audience. That would be the only obstacle they could not control. And it begs the question, why would anyone want to 'interpret' these musical segments when it will be done by the imagination, anyone's imagination.Please,don't think I disapprove of FANTASIA. To the contrary, I love it (and I've never needed to \"turn on\" to view it.) If nothing else, our Uncle Walt brought truly beautiful, \"Long Hair\" music to the mass audience of movie-goers.

The idea of matching music with images may be commonplace to us nowadays, but this is still a unique experience. As it is, I don't know how much I can say about the movie that other people probably haven't already said, so I'm going to talk about various aspects.There was a Looney Tunes cartoon loosely spoofing \"Fantasia\" called \"A Corny Concerto\", in which an unkempt Elmer Fudd - with uncontrollable clothes - presented skits featuring the famous characters; one featured Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig (that must have been the only time that they co-starred) and the other featured Daffy Duck.During the \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" sequence while Mickey Mouse was controlling the stars, I got the feeling that if I could do that, I would make the stars spell out messages. In fact, I would probably make them spell out dirty messages over religious fundamentalist gatherings (I would maybe write something about Elke Sommer; she fuels some of my raunchy thoughts). Speaking of religious fundamentalists, it's pathetic that they removed a scene from this movie that would have showed the evolution of mankind, lest they offend religious fundamentalists. I would have shown the evolution of mankind with the INTENT of irking religious fundamentalists. But getting back to \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", \"The Simpsons\" once portrayed a spoof of it in which Scratchy chops up Itchy, who keeps multiplying, so Scratchy chops him into dust, which he inhales...and the particles chop him up from the inside!Next, the Greek sequence. I noticed that some of the female centaurs were partly naked. How did that pass the censors?! And for a Disney movie, at that?! I now realize that \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" featured a few characters from this movie, namely the brooms, ostrich and hippo. In fact, the song played to accompany the dancing hippos has the same tune as \"Camp Granada\" (although I figure that this one came first). What would Walt Disney have thought had he known that this tune would one day get used for satire?And then, there's the whole end sequence. I see that the evil demon is Chernobog, the Slavonic god of evil. To be certain, the name Chernobog means \"black god\" (when the name got created how ever many hundred years ago, they probably didn't figure that the name might sound racist). \"Night on Bald Mountain\" leading into \"Ave Maria\" reminds me a little bit of the end of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", where the fetus oversees what may be a new stage of humanity.To crown everything, they filmed the movie in Pathe Studios in Culver City, now the home of Sony Studios. To be specific, that's where they film \"Jeopardy!\". Whodathunkit?! OK, so I admit that I've written a totally incoherent review. I just write any idea that comes to me. But my point is that I totally recommend \"Fantasia\".PS: Deems Taylor mispronounced Modest Mussorgsky's last name. It's pronounced MOO-sorg-sky, not moo-SORG-sky."], ["works better as time goes on, and with a little more classical music appreciation", "When I first saw Fantasia it was when it was re-released in theaters some fifteen or so years ago. I remember also it was one of the only times my family and I decided to walk out due to feeling increasing boredom &/or restlessness. I can't remember entirely why it happened, but maybe too many half-hour cartoon shows and other elements had my family and I yawning or not taking what was going on in the film with much enthusiasm. Plus, I was definitely not a fan of classical music. As times have changed, however, I come across Fantasia for the second time and it feels so new, looks so remarkable, and sounds incredible to the point of this being one of those classical-music mandatory experiences. Over time composers like Stravinsky, Beethoven, Shubert and Bach are now my favorites and the selections given for the segments in the film fit wonderfully. And after having gone through many years of animation and seeing its transformations from hand-drawn into computer (which can be great and sometimes can be just crap, just as in the hand-drawn style), some scenes and moments, either in part or in whole, stand as staggering individual works where storytelling is key even as dialog is nil.The Sorcerer's Apprentice was one I saw multiple times by itself on TV and in the 2000 sequel film, and is still pretty sweet and kind of timeless in its own respect. And even as the segment with the ballerina hippos is not entirely successful, there are some movements that do work to no avail. But the masterpieces of the film are, for me, the Stravinsky segment with the creation of Earth and the dinosaur evolution/destruction, which on its own would work well as a short but strung together with the rest of the segments is like the best piece of the puzzle. Unlike what is usually considered the norm in Disney animation, this is dark, bombastic, and unsettling in how it depicts the million-years gone circle of life, and it's probably the most mature piece of animation ever to come out of the studio. The segment that goes hand-in-hand with this one is also equally subversive with the Night on Bald Mountain segment. These are contrasted then with the lighter, fluffier, and genuinely cute segments with the Nutcracker suite and Unicorns and such.So, coming from my past experiences with the film, I'm conflicted as to whether I can recommend the film as much to kids as to adults; those into the simpler told and non-abstracted animation meant for the younger crowd (and those not too fond of the centuries gone composers in a very contemporary age) or those who don't even watch Disney but love art films. It's an experience to see to believe, and whether you can sit through it or not is neither triumph or shame.

I like classical music, especially the more famous parts. 'Fantasia' contains a lot of those famous parts.It starts with Beethoven's \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\". The animations don't have a real storyline here. The same goes for the next segment put on Tchaichovsky's \"The Nutcracker Suite\". Then we get one of the most famous animated things Disney has ever done, \"The Sorceror's Apprentice\", In Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" we see the beginning of the world. Then we have a intermission where a string shows us how instruments look like when the sound would be animated. After this we have Beethoven's \"Pastoral Symphony\". This segment is set on Mount Olympus and we see all the famous creatures that lived there. This is followed by Ponchielli's \"The Dance of the Hours\" in which animals represent different parts of the day. The final segment is split in two. The first part is with the music of Moussorgsky's \"A Night on Bald Mountain\" in which the devil makes his dark creatures dance. This is probably the darkest thing I have ever seen in an animated film done by Disney (not counting the Nazi-cartoons they have made). The second part starts with church bells interrupting the devil and after this the morning comes and we hear the world-famous \"Ave Maria\" from Schubert. It is all beautiful, music and animations.If you don't like classical music just watch the wonderful images on screen. \"The Sorceror's Apprentice\" is my favorite segment, may be because it is the only one with a storyline that involves only one real character.

Producer Walt Disney - together with his legendary artists, the equally legendary Leopold Stokowski, and the music critic Deems Taylor - together, these artists absolutely exploded the idea of a what a film could be, and in the process, forever ended the notion that the medium of animation was a children's medium.The film ignored the conventions of mainstream film, especially in its original release version, and tossed all narrative and dramatic conventions overboard like so much dead weight.It was the first film to feature multi-channel sound. It was the first - and only - film to receive TWO special Academy Awards. It was among the first films added to the National Film Registry, officially declaring the film a National Treasure of the United States of America.

And ever since FANTASIA's re-release in the wake of YELLOW SUBMARINE, Disney's film has succeeded in collapsing the American prejudice against the animated medium, and the film's reputation has only grown more and more, almost exponentially, with each passing year, and each subsequent re-release.There are few films that can be described as true icons of American cinema.

The art is noticeably cheaper looking and the music was often much more forgettable. The net effect was to make me appreciate \"Fantasia\" a bit more.

Both had plenty to offer, both influenced the animation industry heavily, and both made me not want to see them again. The entire premise of Fantasia is pretty cool though. The people behind this movie made various animations that they felt went along with several classical musical pieces. The best segment out of all of them is the very last one with the devil. It was incredibly atmospheric and well done. The Sorcerer's Apprentice bit was good for a laugh, and the abstract pieces at the beginning did a fine job at letting the animator's creativity flow.

The soundtrack was, as I expected, fantastic; however, several of the animated sequences are dreadfully dull, whilst some of the more 'experimental' imagery seem tame by today's standards.A rather dry narrator introduces the film and reveals the intentions of its creators: to represent the music through visual artistry. The orchestra assembles and the conductor, Leopold Stokowski, takes his place. Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor begins, accompanied by garish multicoloured silhouettes of the musicians. Resisting the urge to switch off at this mind numbingly awful start, I soldiered on.Next up for the Disney treatment is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker Suite, in which all manner of animals and plants are anthropomorphised and dance to the music. The animation here is pretty good, but the sequence seems to last forever.Mickey Mouse takes centre stage in the third segment, playing The Sorcerer's Apprentice (with music composed by Paul Dukas). This is certainly an iconic piece of cinema, but I never was a fan of the helium-voiced rodent and once again found my mind wandering, despite the great instrumentals and the chaotic kinetic power of the visuals.Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring accompanies the story of life on Earth, from the forming of the planet to the death of the dinosaurs. Impressive animation and rousing dramatic music make this my favourite part of the movie.In complete contrast, Ludwid Van Beethoven's The Pastoral Symphony and Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours are teamed up with some of the dullest animated moments in Disney history. In the first, sickly sweet cherubs, centaurs, unicorns and flying horses frolic in an idyllic country setting whilst boring the pants off the audience. And the latter features unlikely animals (hippos, ostriches, crocodiles) performing ballet routines. It's yawn inducing and not in the slightest bit funny.Fortunately, the film ends with a wonderfully dark interpretation of Modeste Moussorgsky's Night On Bold Mountain (demons, ghosts and spirits party 'til dawn) and a beautifully tranquil finale accompanied by Franz Schubert's Ave Maria.This is certainly bold movie making from The House of Mouse, but it is not entirely successful.

Every family must know where the image of Mickey with a sorcerer's hat came from. The beginning Toccata and Fugue segment, although only with orchestra musicians, shapes, and colors, is a good beginning segment. The Nutcracker segment is also somewhat classic.The second half is not nearly as important as the first. The short segment where the narrator is talking to the Soundtrack (vertical line that makes shapes for every musical sound) is very fun to watch. The ballet segment with ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators is very good for kids. Other than those latter two, Fantasia could have done without the second half. The Rite of Spring segment with volcanoes and dinosaurs, is enjoyable to me personally, because I like dinosaur movies, but it may be a little too tense for some young kids. The same with the big black devil in the last segment. There is some partial nudity in Beethoven's mythological segment and the last segment, though some may say it's not too offensive. And in my opinion, the second half of the last segment, with nuns walking with candles slowly in the soft music, is just plain boring. There's no music in the closing credits, which makes my personal hobby of watching credits less fun.As for comparing it to Fantasia 2000, I actually like 2000 better, because every segment is good to watch. For more on comparing the two, look for my Fantasia 2000 comment.My recommendation: Own this movie. Whenever you watch it, you can watch the whole thing if you want, but more often, you can watch the first half, and stop after The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

This movie is just more or less of the same the whole time, no matter how good looking it is all and how well the music sounds.Of course it's not an horrible movie though, not at all. It was a very special and original project for its time to mix animated sequences with classical music, from some well known composers, conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The movie for its time also used some unique stereo techniques to really bring out the best when it comes down to its music. All of the animations from the Disney studios are great looking and the movie features some unique moments but most importantly it fits the music very well, A real accomplishment and it must have been a real pain for the animators to work on this movie, to get the timing constantly right.The movie features 7 different segments, to 7 different classical compositions from composers such as Tchaikovsky, Bach and Beethoven. Of course some of the segments are better and more enjoyable than others but overall it's balanced out very well, although some segments drag on for too long.This is also a complaint.

In my opinion, one of the best Disney has ever created. Fantasia is a combination of animation controlled by the classical music. Yes, controlled. In fact, it is actually the music the protagonist of the movie. All the characters and the stories are meant to follow the rhythm of the music, and not vice versa. There is no need of dialogues because the music provides a full understanding of what it is going on in the movie. For example, Tchaikovsky's music is associated to the changing of the seasons while Musorgskij' Night on Bald Mountain and Shubert's Ave Maria symbolize the presence of \"good\" and \"evil\". I believe that this movie created a new way to delivery storytelling, where there is no need of chronological stories or dialogues to understand it, but it only requires lot of imagination. Another thing I really liked is the accurate use of color palette. For example, for the changing of the seasons, they would use soft colors to describe fall and blueish and cold colors to refer to winter.

Maybe I'm just tired of hearing \"The Nutcracker\", as it's easily one of the most famous and overused pieces of classical music.The Sorcerer's Apprentice: It's an okay Mickey Mouse short. The water looked really nice in certain shots, particularly in the dream sequence and the whirlpool, but other than that it was probably the most average short on the fronts of both storytelling and animation.Rite of Spring: Easily the strongest of the shorts from a storytelling standpoint, and has some of the best animation as well. I wouldn't call myself a fan of classical music, but this was also probably my favourite composition out of the bunch. Picture \"The Land Before Time\", only even more brutal and with no dialogue.The Pastoral Symphony: This short is colorful, cutesy, and for the most part completely inoffensive, though I think it does go on for a bit too long. Of course, it's impossible to talk about Fantasia without mentioning the controversy surrounding the racial caricature that appears in this short. Normally I can accept this sort of thing as a product of its time, but whatever your personal feelings are, it's made a MILLION times more offensive by Disney essentially trying to hide the scene from existence and acting like it was never part of the equation. Seriously,  Disney for doing that.Dance of the Hours: Not really a whole lot to say about this one; it's just a bunch of animals dancing ballet, with some decent physical comedy. I will say that this probably has the dullest colour palette out of the bunch, and kind of stands out in a bad way for that reason (that really sounds a lot harsher than what I actually feel, but I can't think of a better way to word it, so whatever).Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Marie: Definitely has the best animation out of the bunch, though I think it's somewhat weaker than \"Rite of Spring\" in terms of storytelling.

Setting scenes of wonderful animation to a backdrop of classical music, the movie acts more as a collection of independent shorts, connected by the theme of their music. Unlike most movies, Fantasia is designed so that the visuals occupancy the audio, not the other way around, and is simply an interpretation of the pieces by a group of artists and animators. That being said, there's always that connectedness of what's going on on screen, and what is coming out of the speakers, the well crafted animations have timing that never fails to be spectacular. The charm of the film comes whether or not it can get you to enjoy the music it accompanies (provided you're someone that doesn't exactly listen to classical music on a daily bias.), and for me, at least, it did just that. There are some segments that do this more successful than others, The Sorcerer's Apprentice obviously being the standout example, but none of the segments are really bad, just not as engaging as their companion pieces. It's entirely personal preference which pieces one likes better, but even if you absolutely hate what's on screen or being played at the moment, it isn't the entire movie, and will change to something maybe more your style.

Most of the movies are about musical numbers performed by live-action pedophile actors with live-action children superimposed with anthropomorphic plants and animals scurrying about a cartoon forest and everyone in that scene is singing about something stupid. How are these movies supposed to represent American family values!? The only reason why Fantasia is better than every other Disney movie is because there is absolutely no singing (not counting the Ave Maria segment, I did not notice there was singing in it until just a few years ago and I could not tell it was in English until literally just at the time of this writing) and only a few seconds of legitimate dialog. Instead, animated segments timed to classical music are projected to give a surreal audio/visual experience (like a drug trip). This saves the trouble of having to go through with a bunch of idiot animals running around singing about how great manual labor is.I feel that this movie is revolutionary because its segments are the first music videos. Without this movie I could never justify why Pink Floyd: The Wall is a real work of art and not just an overlong music video.The direction that this movie takes is genius. Instead of overly happy dogs bursting into inappropriate dancing, the audience enjoys the sight of a T-Rex mauling the crap out of a triceratops, Mickey Mouse chopping a walking broom to pieces with a battle-ax, Zeus throwing a bunch of lightning bolts at some naked horse chicks and scaring them s***less, and Chernobog, the giant demon of Bald Mountain, kicking ass and taking names.This movie is much too good to pass up. There has never been a movie with so much appeal to watch again and again and the animated sequences even sync up with Metallica (try Master of Puppets with the Sorcerer's Apprentice) just like how Dark Side of The Moon syncs with Wizard of Oz.

Would he take another famous fairy tale and turn it into an animated musical? Or would he try to do something else? Something crazy? Innovative? Extraordinary? Well, simply said, he did something else. And not something ordinary, nor rudimentary.Disney, along with his faithful collaborators, created \"Fantasia\". What is \"Fantasia\"? For objective writers, it's a set of animated cartoons mixed with famous classical music pieces. For me, it's the most wonderful animated feature created by Walt Disney.The main reason why \"Fantasia\" is a unique animated picture is because animation becomes an entity itself, something that never happened with any animated feature, before or since. The best example is the first piece: \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. In this part, music is mixed with simple images which represent nothing. You can see musical notes flying over a uniform font and dancing over and over. This kind of animated trick could be seen as easy and unextraordinary today, but remember that this was done in 1940, with archaic methods. The result of this part is the most intricate of all the sketches, while it may not appeal to everybody. In fact, it's the only moment where you can follow the music. Anywhere else, it's the animated scenes that catch you first.The second cartoon is \"Nutcracker Suite\". Here, it's still a ballet, but it's done by mushrooms, fairies, leaves etc. I loved it. The mix of natural elements with animation is simply well done and the music is enthralling.Then comes the most famous part of them all: \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". The main reason why it became the most popular piece of \"Fantasia\" is Mickey Mouse's presence, who stars as the young apprentice , who decide to test the wizard's hat powers in order to allege his tasks. Eventually, it turns into a catastrophe, but things go back in order with the wizard's intervention. That's maybe the easiest part to follow, because it's the only one which has a narrative. The catchiest parts are surely Mickey's dream with the shooting stars, the waves and the clouds.\"The Rite of Spring\" is next and it features the Earth's evolution, from its creation till the dinosaurs' extinction. Inbetween, there's a spectacular volcanic eruption extravaganza and dinosaur battles. These scenes were controversial to me, because the level of fright during the battles was high and I don't think it should appeal to young children. But for more mature audience, it's a great show.Beethoven's 6th Symphony was one of my favorites, as it features mythological creatures, such as centaurs and Cupids, but also a funny Dionysos.The last ones (\"Dance of the Hours\", \"Night on Bald Mountain\" and \"Ave Maria\") were great as well, but I didn't find them as entertaining as the others.Overall, the musical feelings of the classical pieces and the animated scenes are matched together like magnets on a refrigerator and they perfectly fit together. They create a sense of wonder and magic, that makes the viewer dreaming and smiling for a long period of time. The failure of subsequent \"Fantasia 2000\" shows at what point \"Fantasia\" has a unique impact on today's culture and that nothing will ever be as well crafted and executed as Disney's masterpiece.I repeat it, it's the best animated feature of all time and it will certainly remain 'till the end of times."], ["Challenging", "Challenging?

Just artists and musicians.My personal favorites have to go to \"Rite of Spring\" and \"Night on Bald Mountain\".  In \"Rite\", the animators aren't trying to create some bulky hippo in a tutu or dancing fawns.  It is concerned with realism and fluidity, not exaggeration.  In that respect, it succeeds.  \"Night\" remains the best marriage of music and visuals in the entire film because it is not afraid to go the distance.  I haven't a clue what Disney's religious affiliation is, but this this is probably the closest he gets to debating \"good and evil\" in the harshest terms possible in all his work.Overall, beautifully made, this should be a must for music and art appreciators, Disney fans, and those looking for something different.  4 out of 5 stars."], ["A classic film which has had a considerable influence on the cinema", "After 60 years it does not need to be said that this is a great classic film, and it is one that certainly repays viewing periodically.

I have noted that the IMDB already has some 60 viewer comments about this film on line, and until today have not felt justified in adding to these. However I recently reviewed the very few films which I believe have made a major contribution to the development of cinematography as we know it today, and this has led me to decide to send you one brief additional review, making a point which perhaps has not been adequately covered by the comments you already have on line.The modern cinema is far too dependent upon the use of electronic mood music, usually of very poor quality, to help a viewer follow a story. Fantasia stands almost alone as a very popular film which showed that a good cinema with a high quality sound reproduction system has immense potential for use as a concert hall in many smaller communities where this is an unavailable luxury. It is a great pity that more film studios do not appreciate this and generate a series of films where the story is ancillary to the sound track and where really high quality music is offered to the audience as the prime attraction."], ["Fantastic use of colours and music", "Fantasia is not a cartoon made for children. This is an animated film made for adults. After watching this film, I have come upon the realization that most children would get bored and stop watching. Yes Fantasia has its dry parts, otherwise it is the best animated film I have seen.The use of music from such masters as Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Schubert and Tonchielli form the basis for the seven animated shorts that make up this film. Other than short breaks in between segments used to describe the next episode and a brief intermission used to explain sound, the film is basically all animation. Walt Disney had the right idea to go for perfection when making this film and the animators he hired sure did a splendid job.My favourite short was the fourth of the film. Called \"The Right of Spring,\" it shows the formation of our planet all the way until the end of the dinosaurs. Starting off with a visually enthralling volcano sequence, we eventually see life change from one-celled organisms to crustaceans to fish to reptiles and then to dinosaurs. The whole dinosaur sequence was the best in the film with the close resemblance of the animated type to the real thing. The atmosphere and movements that surrounded the creatures was perfect, all flowing naturally until their death which is quite interestingly explained without words.The short titled \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" showcased Mickey Mouse and was quite entertaining, although rather short. Beethoven's 6th, \"The Pastoral\" was also done extremely well using the symphony piece in a mythological setting complete with centaurs, musical cherubs and half-man, half-horse characters and of course the typically fat leader who is having a jolly good time. Finally the seventh sequence using Moussorgska's \"Night On Bald Mountain\" showcased the transformation of all that is evil into \"Ave Maria\" and all things that make up heaven. The beast used in this short is rather frightening and would probably give many children nightmares for many nights to come. The short itself plays well to end the film, although could have ended on a greater high.I like the fact that some Disney films do not follow the formula that they use in all of their films today and in the past few decades. Perhaps Disney could try and create another film like Fantasia (I've heard of something called \"Fantasia 2000\" , but have no clue as to what it is all about) although most people would probably stay away from it just like most people stayed away from Fantasia in 1940.

Only Night on Bald Mountain (and Ave Maria, which is attached to Night on Bald Mountain) is completely unattached from the style of the rest of the animation from the film. Everything, from the abstract Toccata and Fugue segment, the Nutcracker Suite, The Rites of Spring, even The Sorcerer's Apprentice tend to look as if they were animated by Disney artists. This is why, I assume: Disney was the greatest producer of feature-length animation. The styles of other animated films, such as Warner Brothers and UA (e.g., Popeye), were rough and obviously made for sort subjects. Disney probably did not think that his animators needed to look at other artwork in order to inspire their drawings. Therefore, everything begins to look the same, except for the final two pieces, which are completely different. This film's sequel, Fantasia 2000, obviously searches around more to find different inspirations. You cannot tell that the Rhapsody in Blue segment, inspired by the caricatures of Al Hirschfeld, was created by the same person who did The Carnival of Animals, a work on watercolor that looks inspired by Matisse or other similar artists. The Symphony #5 piece does not in any way resemble any other piece. This can be said about every segment in Fantasia 2000. Different art styles, different colors, different media were used in every segment. I gave them both a 9/10, but I do think Fantasia 2000 provides more variety."], ["After 60 years, still one of the greatest animated films ever made.", "With \"Fantasia\", Walt Disney reached the pinnacle of excellence in the animated feature category.  The film, as most everyone now knows grew out of Walt's desire to cast Mickey Mouse in a cartoon short based on Paul Dukas' \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", but was expanded to a full-feature presentation, when costs of the short were three times that of a traditional Mickey Mouse cartoon.  The film is, for lack of a better work, spectacular. Never before, or even since, had the animators at Disney executed such a lavish treatment on the field of animation.  From the abstract drawings set to J.S. Bach's \"Toccata & Fugue in D Minor\" to the thrilling dinosaur duel in Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\"; from the ballet dancing hippo's in Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\" to the good vs. evil finale of Mussorgsky's \"Night On Bald Mountain\" paired with Schubert's \"Ave Maria\" this film is crammed full of memorable images.  Sadly, however Walt Disney never lived to see his most personal film become the classic that it is regarded today.  Critical and audience indifference in the '40's, '50's, and most of the '60's kept the film \"an expensive experiment that failed\". Today however there are few who don't look at \"Fantasia\" as a classic and it is still one of the most often cited films that provided many with the dream of becoming involved in the world of animation.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"]], "Dumbo": [["Short and sweet.", "All the other elephants shun Dumbo for his gigantic ears, and his mother has been locked up for protecting him, so he's all alone in the world... until Timothy Q Mouse shows up.A beautiful piece of work.

The design is beautiful and deceptive in its simplicity. While it may lack the overstuffed quality of `Pinocchio' or the abstract one of `Fantasia,' the style of `Dumbo' is elegant, vivid, and occasionally grotesque in ways that recall not only classic circus posters but also Paul Cadmus paintings and vintage `New Yorker' cover art.  In fact, the entire production has a hint of nostalgia about it; for all its dark story elements, the film presents a rosy-hued portrait of old America (with Casey Junior cheerfully pulling his traveling circus through green open fields) that must have seemed very comforting as audiences prepared for the unforeseeable terrors of another World War.  (A `Dumbombers for Defense' poster in the film's epilogue is the one joking reference to an increasingly unsteady world situation.)  In the midst of this cozy landscape, we find a simple, tender story about acceptance and mother love, with the characters of both Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo finding a wonderful eloquence in their muteness.  These performances are true triumphs of animation.  The other characters, both good and bad, are painted with broad, memorable strokes. It's become fashionable to look rather harshly upon the Jim Crow sequence and all its uncomfortable associations, and it can be difficult for a modern audience to watch it without cringing slightly.  But it should be pointed out that the crows are not only the film's cleverest characters (both in terms of thought and language), they are also the only ones except Timothy to show any sympathy whatsoever to the little elephant; after all, they are outsiders themselves.  The sequence is a play on a stereotype, that can't be denied, but I would argue that it is an attempt to revise that stereotype into something positive and sympathetic.  The songs and score are flawless, and the show-stopping, nightmarish pink elephant sequence keeps things from getting too artistically conservative--and, just like the rest of the film, it still thrills us no matter how many times we have seen it.  10 out of 10."], ["7.4?????

It is, I'll admit, a story that has made me cry more than once; and in this instance I don't feel that I've been cheated into crying, because there really is something poignant and heartbreaking about this ugly duckling variant.Like Hans Andersen, Disney has to pad the outfit a bit to make it fill the space available; yet, with the exception of the introductory bit with the storks, it doesn't feel like padding.

That's a pity because Edwards does a fine job giving voice to the best song from the score, When I See An Elephant Fly.

However, that's purely a personal opinion. Most people love the film exactly the way it is. And (aside from wishing it were just that mite longer), I do too.Oddly, my enthusiasm for Dumbo is a new-born thing. Many times I saw it as a child. I enjoyed the gossipy elephants (\"Listen, girls, have I got a trunk-full of dirt?\"), but I found many aspects of the film too grotesque for enjoyment - Dumbo himself; the clowns; particularly the \"Pink Elephants\"; even the circus train. As an adult, I enjoy these characters enormously. I revel in the inventiveness and wit of the drawing, I applaud the innovations of a more abstract, less formal Disney, I enjoy the polish and sophistication, the sly humor and satiric edge of the dialogue. Most of all, I gambol deliriously along with the songs, so consistently clever in lyrics (\"I've seen a peanut stand, I've heard a diamond ring, but I've never seen an elephant fly!\") and so catchily scored, who could resist?The answer is - children. If ever Disney made a cartoon that will appeal mostly to adults, Dumbo is it. No wonder Bosley Crowther went overboard in praise (all of it justly deserved)! No wonder Dumbo made the New York Times Ten Best Films of 1941.Admittedly, there are many grotesque elements in Disney's other feature cartoons which would repulse, terrify or antagonize children. Normally these are counter\u00acbalanced by an overdose of moralizing, by dreary stretches of sweetness and light. But Dumbo is uncompromisingly pragmatic. Its view of self-seeking self-fulfillment is undiluted by sentiment, strengthened by satire. Aside from Timothy Q. Mouse, the stork, Mrs Jumbo and Dumbo himself, the human and animal characters are either malicious (the elephants) or venal (the clowns, the ring\u00acmaster). Of the \"good\" characters, the stork is too earnestly stupid and Mrs Jumbo too possessively simple-minded to elicit much sympathy - and even Timothy and Dumbo are often viewed primarily as simple figures of fun.No child could appreciate the gentle mockery of Dumbo in which clowns are presented as an uncomfortable mirror image of adults, and cartoon children are unflinchingly drawn as loutish brats.From a technical viewpoint, Dumbo represents the Disney craftsmen at the apex of their powers. From the timing of the visual gags to the swift editing of the fall of the pachyderms, from the brilliant atmosphere and color of the backgrounds and effects to the faultless dubbing of voice and song, from the clever characterizations of humans, animals and train to the amusing artistry of inventive surrealism on parade, Dumbo is a masterpiece."], ["It broke my heart but it's a masterpiece", "Baby mine scene was the most emotional scene in any movie in my opinion.

It may be Disney's shortest feature, but it's possibly the biggest in pure heart, as the emotional appeal of it is positively through the roof! I always responded quite strongly to it, I think it's one of those magical works of animation that speaks to the inner goodness and child in all of us. At just over an hour it chugs along steadily and it feels like just the right amount of time to me, not too little nor too much. And animation-wise it is something of a downgrade from the pictures that preceded it and is less visually rich and distinctly more cartoony, but that was by design and out of necessity. I like the animation style, I think the more vivid colour scheme and more brighter open backgrounds add to the very distinctive circus atmosphere and visual style of the film that to me makes it a lot of fun. Nobody should ever make the mistake of thinking of this movie as 'lazy' filmmaking, because no mere half-hearted effort could ever have inspired such love over so many years. How it can make you so sad you want to cry during the masterful work of emotion that is the \"Baby Mine\" sequence which is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching moments in Disney movies ever, and then how warm and joyful the feeling is at the end when he flies into her embrace as Casey Jones the train moves off into the sunny distance is? That's great scripting, voicing, and characterisation at work, this clearly had a lot of love put into it. There's a reason amusement parks the world over have cute little whirly-gig rides that lift off the ground bearing Dumbo's image! The characterisation of him is truly exceptional. Despite never saying a word except for some adorable sneezes and squeals, Dumbo is a great character and you always know exactly what he's thinking as he reacts to everything with his big blue eyes. I think the reason he's such a beloved little character isn't only because he's so cute, but because of how much we care and root for him and want to see him pull through and be reunited with his loving mother. A lot of characters are very mean to him but it does make it count more when someone is nice to him, and it does make his eventual victory all the more triumphant as he flies high over all and becomes the biggest ever star of the big top. I also love Timothy the mouse who appoints himself as Dumbo's mentor and protector. He's such a great witty mouse, and he's nothing remotely like Mickey. Ed Brophy did a fantastic job. Note the possible reference to Nosferatu as Timothy approaches the sleeping ringmaster to subliminally give him his inspiration! Oh my, the crows. Well I like them, apart from Timothy they're the only ones in the story to be sympathetic to Dumbo's plight and it's because of them why Dumbo really learns how to fly. The moody animation sequence of the \"Roustabouts\" song is the best in the whole movie, dark and powerful and driving as everybody works together to gradually raise the tent, the quality of the animation is leagues above the rest of the picture during that one sombre song. So anyway the legendary Pink Elephants sequence remains such a blast to watch after so many years. I don't know quite what to make of it, except for finding it so awesomely random. You just don't know if it's meant to be funny, very odd or plain spooky! It's so crazily creative how all the elephants merge and break apart while keeping a great visual and thematic flow to the whole surreal exercise. It's like the animators couldn't keep their creativity in check and just had to sneak in their big bizarre musical number! I'm so glad they did, as it adds a lot of spice to the movie all by itself.

There is much that's utterly charming about this wholly appealing fable, with some extremely endearing heroes, a healthy amount of comedy, moments both sad and scary, wonderful ditties, and some of the most imaginative animation for a Disney film of the time. (The \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" sequence is stunning in its imagery.) And it sure does have a great message about self esteem and finding ones' way in the world.Mrs. Jumbo, an elephant in a circus, gets a delightful present from Mr. Stork: a little bundle of joy who just so happens to have oversized ears. Cruelly dubbed Dumbo by Mrs. Jumbos' ignorant fellow pachyderms, he is befriended by the engaging, upbeat Timothy Q.

It isn't until after a night, when Dumbo accidentally imbibes, that he and Timothy discover the hidden talent that will make him a star.Guaranteed to stir the emotions of young and adult viewers alike, \"Dumbo\" is very short (an hour and four minutes all told) and sweet. Based on a book by Helen Aberson & Harold Pearl, it does pack a good story into those 64 minutes. In addition to the characters mentioned, the ones who deserve a mention are those amusing crows who start out mocking Dumbo like so many others here, but get their own heart strings tugged and end up helping him a great deal. Dumbo himself has no dialogue, and therefore his character is established with irresistible expressions and reactions.

Both of these films are generally considered to be the pinnacle of animation and for good reason. The artists went all out with visual lushness, elaborate use of the multiplane camera, and extensive special effects. Yet, the timing of the production and release of those films could not have been worse. WWII and economic setbacks caused both films to lose money at the box office. This led Walt to produce a film on a modest budget to recoup the costs.When comparing DUMBO to the films that preceded it, one can see that the lushness is not there. However, lushness doesn't equate to an excellent film. And without a big budget, DUMBO is a showcase of what a Disney film was all about; solid storytelling with solid character animation. Although very few other animation studios at that time had the budgets to produce a film like PINOCCHIO, they're films almost never elicited an emotional response from audiences like a Disney film did. And with a modest budget, DUMBO has stood the test of time as a prime example of that.There has been some controversy in recent decades regarding the crows that befriend Dumbo. I don't question why modern viewers may object to the stereotyped depiction, but it's never made sense to me why DUMBO has been readily available for decades on home video when SONG OF THE SOUTH has not. Both films have characters rooted in derogatory stereotypes (i.e. the head crow's name is Jim Crow, but his name isn't uttered in the film). I haven't seen a consistency with the stance on political correctness.Although not having the lushness of PINOCCHIO, DUMBO is often cited as one of Disney's greatest films."], ["Still in my top ten favorite Disney films", "Dumbo is one of those films that works for all ages- the kids will gleefully follow along with the comic-tragic story of Dumbo and his friend Timothy Mouse; teens and young adults will want to watch it for the strange, surreal animation (and the humor, which is actually at times not quite meant for kids- i.e. the scenes with the crows); adults won't be bored by it in the least when they watch with their children. I would even equate the entertainment value of Dumbo with one of the more recent Pixar films- it's funny, but there are serious elements (in this case fairly dramatic; the animation is lively, detailed, and experimenting with the possibilities; and, its got heart behind its wit. For such a short film, it gives a lot to offer.Although not quite a fairy tale, Dumbo presents a story that most kids can identify with- the importance of having someone to look after you, fitting in, being the outsider, and accomplishing something over odds with the world. Dumbo, of course, got the name from the gossiping, talkative elephants who are shocked at \"Jumbo Jr's\" huge ears. This becomes part of the tragedy of the story, as Mrs. Jumbo (in one of the more intense scenes of the film, among others) does everything she can to protect her from the circus crowds. Dumbo is befriended by Timothy the mouse, who helps to trump him as the elephant to give the ringmaster his big \"climax\" for his act. When it goes disastrously wrong, and Dumbo is made into a clown, it leads to a night of heavy drinking between the two friends (by accident, of course kids), and this leads to one of the virtuoso sequences in any Disney film.The 'Pink Elephants' sequence, involving massive, perfunctory dream-like images of these creatures doing the strangest, most random things, is an example of something that Disney could do that could be appealing overall to an audience. Even today, there's something about the power, the danger, and the song and lyrics itself behind it that makes it effective. It has a message behind it, I suppose (maybe not to drink champagne and blow bubbles), but more than anything it adds a perfect sense of illusionment in the part of the story that needs it- Dumbo, before this scene, has had an extremely heart-felt connection with his mother (behind bars), and story-wise there has to be something that happens to him that takes him to the next step, the real discovery he and Timothy make about his future (i.e. the crows). Although much of the film is, like the circus itself, fantastical and bigger-than-life, I can't say enough about the pink elephants.Not to say that the film isn't at all dated (I even knew when I was very young watching the film that it was not of my time- the way the crows speak has an underlying racist quality to it that was acceptable in Hollywood at the time), but there is a lasting power to 'Dumbo' that works more than sixty years later. The themes are clear, the songs are enjoyable, and the tones of the film shift like the best drama/comedies of the time in regular films."], ["Very simple and nearly perfect.", "Years ago, I thought \"Dumbo\" was a bit of fluff--a simple film that Disney made between their 'better' films, \"Bambi\" and \"Pinocchio\". However, when I saw this film again many years later, I was extremely impressed and would place this among the best of Disney's films--even though it's not a perfect movie. While it is true that the animation style is a bit simpler than these two other films, \"Dumbo\" still is a nice looking film. Its use of bright primary colors works great and is perfect for a picture set at a circus. And, as far as the story goes, it's really, really hard not to love the characters and find yourself choked up as you watch the film. Seeing the portion where Dumbo's mother sings to him as she's locked away from his will touch ANYONE'S heart--no matter how jaded they are--it's just brilliantly written and executed.My only real reservation is that some will no doubt find the crows in the film a bit offensive. While they are NOT stupid or evil, they are clearly meant to be like black people--with exaggerated language and features. Still, considering the times, this is a relatively benign slight compared to what you often saw in films!Well worth seeing and a delight.By the way, this is NOT a complaint, but for anyone interested, the beginning is a bit strange, given that I live only a few miles from the old winter quarters for the circus, here in Sarasota, Florida. First, Sarasota is not THAT far south (like they show on the map)--that location would actually place the circus in the Everglades! Also, they show lots of huge hills/mountains, but I think the highest natural elevation in this part of Florida is about 9 inches!

I've always loved the classic Disney cartoons (\"Snow White\" in particular) and have not loved the more recent Disney cartoon movies (though I appreciate the animation and Robin Williams in \"Aladdin\"). So I'm struggling with why this movie didn't bowl me over.It was supposed to! It's made in the middle of many American cinema masterworks\u2014the same year as \"Citizen Kane\" after all\u2014and it's just a few short years since \"Snow White\" and one year after the amazing (if long) \"Fantasia.\" (That film lost so much money, Disney made \"Dumbo\" short and on the cheap, which explains a little.)What gives? I think the movie ended up simply being \"cute\" and \"for children,\" I put these in quotes because these are good things. But they didn't work for me, sitting up alone watching it as a movie. It's great on many levels of course, including \"Elephants on Parade\" where the animation takes a spin into fantasy. But the story line is as thin as it is cloying, sad as it is obvious. It's perfect for kids of all ages, as long as they don't mind getting their heads messed up. (Kids handle it well in general, but many comment on how it deeply affects them.)One interesting thing to notice: there is a hint (that I can tell) of World War II affairs in the telling. The Ringmaster's voice is by German-born actor Herman Bing, a Nazi sympathizer who later committed suicide. His accent, famously pan- European, is toned down, but it's here.This is no social protest film, of course. Charles Chaplin, being a concerned artist type, made \"The Dictator\" the previous year. Disney, a famous patriot in the old sense (and Republican), later went on (after Pearl Harbor in late 1941) to be extremely active and generous making wartime films (propaganda films, mostly) for the government. The most famous, of Donald Duck having a nightmare about Hitler in 1943, shows what is not here to an extreme.In fact, \"Dumbo\" has become more famous for the crows being voiced by African-American actors, and a debate, easily discovered on-line, goes into how racist this may or may not be. The voices are certainly typecast in a way very common in Hollywood movies of the time. They have a huge role in the film, however, and an interesting one to dissect. It's also been pointed out that poor Dumbo is never empowered\u2014he never speaks, for example, but he does get drunk, poor child. Of course, he also flies. For real. And he doesn't have peanut allergies, thank goodness. That's power.So \"Dumbo\" is a brilliant trifle, a compact flexing of some great animation muscle. It is not a brilliant story but it's a very sad one for children who love their mothers (or miss them very much, as I do). It's not a very imaginative telling of the story, for the most part, or even a groundbreaking bit of animation, for the most part.But it is enjoyable\u2014yes, endlessly.

Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever.And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful \"Baby Mine\", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes.Disney \"A\" League is Dumbo. 10/10"], ["An animated classic", "When the storks come to the circus delivering baby animals Mrs Jumbo is upset as her expected package has not arrived.

At first things don't go according to plan but eventually after an encounter with some friendly crows he comes up with an idea that will make Dumbo the most famous elephant the world has ever known!At just over an hour in length this film is definitely rather short; that doesn't mean it shouldn't be considered a classic though; it just means the creators told the story in the required amount of time and didn't pad it out with unnecessary material. The story is quite delightful even if it is surprisingly bleak at times with its theme of bullying, the ostracism of the main character and the treatment of his mother; thankfully it is told in a way that shouldn't be upsetting and any sadness caused by those early scenes is more than made up for with the happy ending. The animation is delightful if a more cartoony than I was expecting; a particularly liked the expert use of shadows in many scenes. The characters were pretty good; especially Timothy, the catty elephants, the crows and Dumbo of course.

In regard to the crows, I saw nothing racist about them, they are stereotypical yes in a sense but in a positive way. Timothy the mouse is also memorable, a bit like Dumbo's conscience in a sense.

The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, \"Jim.\" It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, \"the Sambo.\" The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other \"white\" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, \"When I See a Elephant Fly\" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was \"Baby Mine\", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films.

It could be easily used in the classroom, or by parents, to spark discussions on how to treat others.Anyone upset with the 'fantasia\" scene (where Dumbo and his friend get drunk by mistake), can leave it out. It is not an integral part of the story, but is indeed a work of art.Some crows help Dumbo, and apparently some see them as a stereotype on afro Americans. Frankly, both as a child and as an adult, I didn't realize the connotations...(if any are there); I just noted the Southern accent. The crows scene is more problematic to leave out, as it is really an integral part of the story. And if one minority group helps another discover that self-belief is a powerful tool, I don't see it as being bad, frankly. The crows are not negative, in my opinion.

Unfortunately when protecting Dumbo (the young elephant) she gets chained up for going mad at people picking on him. Dumbo is now alone, will new friend Timothy Mouse comes along and plans to make him famous with his big ears. The first attempt goes horribly wrong, and as a result Dumbo is turned into a clown. Dumbo and Timothy do get their fame in the end, after demonstrating to some crows, and then the circus audience, that his ears are big enough to make him fly, and he gets his mother back too. The sequences that are most memorable are the teary brief reuniting of Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo with the song \"Baby Mine\", and of course, my favourite, when Dumbo and Timothy get drunk, blow bubbles, and have the great hallucination of many pink elephants, the song and the sequence are just brilliantly imaginative. Dumbo is the only Disney character that never speaks, and I never realised, but this film is almost exactly one hour long (plus one minute), no wonder it is considered a bit of an underdog film. It won the Oscar for Best Original Music, and was nominated for Best Song for \"Baby Mine\", and it won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Animation Design.

Fantasia, the previous Disney film, had been a catastrophe in the box office, and thus Dumbo was made with a very limited budget to earn some quick cash.And it shows. As a child you probably didn't really notice, but watch Pinocchio/Fantasia and this back to back and you can see that the animation level is nowhere close. The character models are simplified, the movement seems jerky and/or too fluid, like everyone is made of melting wax, the lines are somewhat rough and even the backgrounds are not that impressive. Of course, this is only when compared to Disney's previous standards. By any objective measure this is a well-animated film.And what it loses in aesthetics, it more than makes up in characters and charm. The story of Dumbo, a young elephant born with ears way too big, is a string-tucker beyond comparison. The story is also short and sweet enough that Dumbo doesn't overstay his welcome, and contains some really memorable scenes, like the Pink Elephants on Parade or Dumbo's mom's lullaby to her son. Good stuff in general. It's not the most complex of stories, but it's a lot better than it has any right to be, given the film's rushed nature.And that's Dumbo. It's probably meant for younger children than the typical Disney film, but like most films from the self-proclaimed greatest animation studio on Earth, it has some good material for adults to appreciate as well.

Dumbo feels lonely and sad not for long as a mouse named Timothy who tired of seeing the others pick on him because of his ears.Timothy and Dumbo quickly form a friendship and Timothy tries to find a way to help free Dumbo's mother once they make him a star.Now the movie does share the true value of friendship as shown with Timothy who is one of those friends who accept someone for who they are and don't care for those who pick on others because they're different.Looking back that is what makes Timothy the mouse a huge part to the plot as he helps the Protagonist Dumbo throughout the film.Now the plot of the film for a short classic does tell a great story about never giving up and how a true friend really cares.The animation is well done and perfectly time as well goes to show how well Disney films did for their animation films from the day.The voice acting is top notch and each actor perform very well for the characters they play.Dumbo is just one of those timeless classics that any movie fan will enjoy.Overall Dumbo is a wonderful classic with very well done animation and voice acting that help tell the story of Dumbo, The movie is fun and wonderful for the whole family to enjoyI give Dumbo an 8 out of 10"], ["Dumbo is short, but it's still very impressive.", "The Walt Disney Company had made some incredible progression throughout the 1930's. The first full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, was very successful and the second one, Pinocchio, although less successful financially, proved to be a critically acclaimed hit. But because of the ongoing World War II, Disney lost a lot of money with the releases of Pinocchio and Fantasia, since the European and Asian markets were cut off. So Walt Disney had to reduce the costs for his next feature. The result was the release of Dumbo in 1941. The film only lasts 63 minutes, the animation isn't as richly detailed as the much more expensive Pinocchio and the story of Dumbo is very simple. But still, Dumbo manages to offer a lot for such a short film.Based upon the story written by Helen Aberson, Dumbo is a film about a little elephant named Jumbo Jr, although most of the other characters call him 'Dumbo'. After Mr. Stork (a stork voiced by Sterling Holloway) delivers Dumbo to his mother, Mrs. Jumbo, the other elephants make fun of Dumbo because he has enormous ears. The kids who visit the circus Dumbo and his mother perform at, humiliate Dumbo, which upsets Mrs. Jumbo, so she attacks one of the boys. She gets locked up and Dumbo is left all alone. The other elephants want nothing to do with him, because of his big ears. A mouse named Timothy Q. Mouse (voiced by Edward Brophy) feels sympathy for Dumbo and they eventually develop a friendship. Timothy envisions Dumbo as the crowning jewel on top of a pyramid of elephants. He reveals his idea to the Ringmaster (voiced by Herman Bing), while the Ringmaster is asleep. The idea fails miserably, as Dumbo makes a mistake and the pyramid falls apart, costing injuries to the other elephants. To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to Mrs. Jumbo, which leads to the emotional scene where Dumbo and his mother rejoice, although it's only for a short while. Dumbo and Timothy drink some water from a bucket, but there's some champagne in the bucket as well. They end up drunk because of the champagne and have hallucinations of pink elephants, better known as the 'Pink elephants on Parade' scene. The next morning, they wake up while they are in the top of a high tree. There are some crows in there, who make fun of them at first, but after a while they start to feel sympathy for Dumbo and help him to fly by using a magic feather, while in reality, Dumbo flew up that tree without even realizing it. When Dumbo is set for another circus show as a clown who has to jump out of a window, he looks to fly so he doesn't have to fall down. He loses his feather on his way out of the window, but still manages to fly. Dumbo becomes a hit as a flying elephant, along with his manager, Timothy. Dumbo and his mother get their own car on 'Casey Junior', the circus train.While Dumbo is not a groundbreaking picture, it's still very enjoyable. Dumbo has a lot of heart and that's what makes it worth the view. The songs are great, especially the 'Pink elephants on Parade' and the 'Baby Mine' stand out. The animation isn't as dazzling as it was in Pinocchio or Fantasia, but still features some eccentric visuals like it does with the 'Pink elephants' scene. Dumbo is a likable character. He doesn't talk, but you can easily sympathize with the little elephant. The crows and Timothy Q. Mouse make for some memorable characters that help to move the film along nicely. Dumbo isn't as mesmerizing as some of the other Disney classics, but if you're looking for some lighthearted family entertainment, Dumbo is definitely worth the view."], ["Dumbo Blu-Review", "The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001.The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name \"Dumbo\" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one.Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts \"The Flying Mouse\" and \"Elmer Elephant\" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids.

I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby.This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour.Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10."], ["Amazing story", "I don't understand why people have been giving this lower points due to it not being for kids....ALL Disney films are supposed to be FOR ALL AGES not just kids so it shouldn't have lost points for that!It's an amazing heartwarming story.

Made to recoup the big budget of \"Fantasia\", it's only fitting that Disney, by making its first and only original story, created the most representative illustration of the Disney spirit through the adorable little circus elephant.Indeed, on the surface, \"Dumbo\" is the Disney film with the most cartoonish feel, it is inferior to \"Snow White\" as far as animation is concerned and had nothing to be compared to \"Fantasia\", as for the animals' design, they can't even be seen as a draft for the next masterpiece \"Bambi\". Still, \"Dumbo\" has something that elevates it above all these considerations, an emotionality that raises it above all the other Disney films and that still inspire many people afflicted with a social handicap in the world. Through the figure of a little elephant who can't speak, \"Dumbo\" speaks the most universal truths about acceptance, tolerance and the capability to accept the others' flaws, its message is universal, and its charm is unique.I feel guilty to put \"Dumbo\" above \"Bambi\" because I've always considered the second as Disney's ultimate masterpiece, and many would argue that \"Pinocchio\" has the same message than \"Dumbo\" but with a better drawing, but the force of \"Dumbo\" lies in the pure and blue eyes of the little elephant and the characteristics that make him the most endearing of all Disney characters. Bambi is great but as I mentioned in a previous review, the film is more about the passing of time and the little fawn is only an element of an eternal circle of life. \"Dumbo\" is about a character, the cutest thing that ever been drawn, the pride of his mother, Mrs Jumbo, that an unfortunate sneezing would makes his ears enormous. And in one second, Jumbo Jr. Is renamed Dumbo by the mean-spirited gossipy female elephants of the circus troop, in one frame; Walt Disney created the character that would embody the sort of benign handicap that would crystallize all the mockery and cruelty of the world.My ears are not big, they're even smaller than average but I know many kids who were given the terrible nickname of 'Dumbo', or other meaner ones. I remember my younger brother having issues with his ears and I couldn't understand why one would make such a big deal, but this is what childhood is about, either we learn to accept our flaws and the others' flaws, either we learn how to point our fingers on what is wrong with the other and take pleasure from that. Walt Disney, contrarily to what his current reputation make people believe, never sugar-coated the reality or depicted a cute world with talking animals and sappy songs, all his films had an intelligence, a message for kids and adults, and kids were not necessarily depicted in their advantage. Take \"Pinocchio\" and the Island sequence, in \"Dumbo\", the adults are the bullies, and \"Dumbo\" represents the poor little infant incapable to perceive hostility and trying to do his best to please everyone.This is where I identified with \"Dumbo\", as a child, I was awfully shy, to a point I never spoke in class, why? Because I was easily impressed and couldn't deal with more than one person, it's over since the age of six but I remember how hard it was, to face the ugly comments of some adults who asked if I was deaf, dumb or something. The name Dumbo represents the constant mix-up between silence and dumbness, the fact that someone who doesn't talk back, who doesn't express his anger is either weak or dumb, and that there's no place in this cynical world for good hearts. \"Dumbo\" takes all the hostility and his mother replies to the rest of the world. In a heart-breaking scene, she defends her son bullied by the kind of kid that would have deserved the Lampwick-treatment. Therefore she's immediately locked up in a cage as a mad elephant. The film works as a wonderful tribute to the purity and indivisibility of a mother's love, incarnated by the song \"Baby's Mine\" that echoes the beginning where the storks send all the kids to their mothers.\"Dumbo\" carries a powerful message about love as the only true sacred element in life, love and friendship, incarnated by the protective figure Timothy the Mouse, Dumbo's only friend, funnier and less patronizing than Jiminy Cricket. Still, Disney doesn't send the wrong message that even if you have a handicap, you'll still have people who love you and help you. Dumbo is not a passive character and his journey with Timothy will end up by learning how to overcome his weaknesses not by denying it or getting rid of it but by translating into a force. The ears would turning into wings mirrors the eternal theme of the metamorphosis, the ugly chrysalis that turn into a magnificent butterfly, the ugly duckling who becomes a beautiful swan. \"Dumbo\" teaches us in his language that what doesn't kill us -and being different never killed anyone- makes us stronger, if we find the strength to get over it. The message of \"Dumbo\" justifies its place in the American Film's Institute Top 100 Cheers, along with \"Pinocchio\" as both shows children who achieved things by themselves.But in all honesty, the film wouldn't be half the classic it is, if it didn't provide us the unforgettably nightmarish \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" sequence. I would never forget the haunting sights of these Technicolor pachyderms with absent eyes and how I used to cover my eyes when came the elephant made of elephants' heads but as a grown-up, I see this part as one of the greatest Disney moments ever, with the all-seeing eye that almost winks at the adults we became with still a little of Dumbo, inside our hearts."], ["A film that made me cry as a kid, proves it's okay to be different and one can even fly!", "\"Dumbo\" is one of those Disney classics that I will never forget it's a film that stayed with me from childhood.

To say that Dumbo \"is about an elephant with big ears in a circus\" is only the start of what Dumbo is about.A closer look at Dumbo - it's about having physical abnormalities and over coming the fear of others shunning or making fun of you because of it - the movie shows you can still 'shine' no matter what you look like. In this respect, Dumbo is similar to the films \"The Elephant Man\" or \"Roxanne\".The saddest scene in the film, to me, was when Dumbo was ripped away from his mother Mrs. Jumbo.

Shunned by the other elephants, he is forced to be a castaway until he is befriended by a little mouse and enters the circus with his new trait - ears that can make him fly.There are some depressing moments in this movie, especially the scene where Dumbo's mother is in confinement. You won't see any magic or tricks in this one like you would normally see in a fairytale and I think the music is not as remarkable as in other Disney films. Though the animation is colorful, characters are lovable and the story is pretty compelling, this movie overall is little on the short side, with just over one hour in length, and I think it lacks the majesty you would see in many of Disney's classics. However, it's still a good fun movie showcasing courage, friendship and a mother's love. The climax is my favorite. It's great for the kids.Grade B"], ["Disney's most basic early film, but no less memorable and emotional", "Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, \"Dumbo.\" At an unusually short 63 minutes, \"Dumbo\" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself.\"Dumbo\" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film.When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him \"Dumbo.\" At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself \u2014 until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion.The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, \"Bambi\") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song \"Baby Mine\" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy.\"Dumbo\" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give \"Dumbo\" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics.\"Song of the Roustabouts,\" for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie.\"Pink Elephants on Parade\" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of \"Fantasia,\" which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent.At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him.Over time, these regrettable choices have given \"Dumbo\" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off \"Fantasia\" and \"Pinocchio,\" \"Dumbo\" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but \"Dumbo\" stands out with more than big ears.~Steven CThanks for reading!

And this little wonder glided straight to the bank. With most of his animators on strike, a strangled budget and a severely abbreviated time length, he was able to create what the world craved: magic in the true Disney style. The less expensive watercolors added a brilliant vibrancy to the backgrounds, and he stuck to his guns releasing it as an A-film with no additions to the running time.As for the film itself, it has all the elements: humorous characters from the stork to the crows. A catchy and memorable score. A tear-jerking rendition of Baby-Mine. A character you could cheer for, though he said no word, and snobby villains you delighted to triumph over. Tight pacing that moves briskly along without losing you. I can scarcely believe it when the film draws to a close.My criticisms: while admittedly imaginative and not long enough to really throw a kink in the pace, I am not a fan of Pink Elephants on parade. It's just too weird and acid-trippy. A baby elephant gets drunk and is chased on screen by hallucinations of elephant-demons- you have to admit it's freakin weird. Though I will give my props on making it one of the most memorable scenes in animation, even if just because it is so terrifying.Overall, I have to admit to liking Dumbo for what it is- a cute and very entertaining little film. It's wonderful for its intended audience and far from unwatchable as you get older.Quote of the Film:-Did you ever see an elephant fly? -Well, I've seen a horse fly. -Ah, I've seen a dragon fly. -Hee-hee. I've seen a house fly."], ["Another Masterpiece from Walt Disney", "\"Dumbo\" was made at a horrible time for the Disney studios. World War II broke out, the ambitious and expensive \"Pinocchio\" and \"Fantasia\" failed at the box office. Disney toned down the ambitions planned for \"Bambi\". In the mean time, Disney quickly put \"Dumbo\" into production, a relatively cheap film that would help the Disney studios get some revenue.Despite the budget and schedule, Walt Disney knew that story and character came first, and that's exactly what \"Dumbo\" shows. At a short 64-minute runtime, \"Dumbo\" accomplishes a lot. The animators bring a lot of appeal into the title character and every other character. The villain in \"Dumbo\" is society, and how it treats an outsider like Dumbo himself. The story is about Dumbo overcoming this and becoming a success.The animation in \"Dumbo\" is more like a Silly Symphony, rather than the likes of \"Pinocchio\" and \"Fantasia\". For its small budget, it looks great and the movements are great. The backgrounds may not super-detailed, but they look great none-the-less. The character animation fires on all cylinders. The music is good as well. The film has the same emotional content as the previous Disney films, and the film makes you feel bad for the outcast elephant, successfully.Unfortunately, it tends to be looked at as inferior. The film is not advertised properly anymore (like any Disney film) and it comes off as something children's-like, when it is really one of Disney's darkest and borderline-depressing films (Depends on who you are). \"Dumbo\" may be one of Disney's saddest films (along with \"Bambi\"), but there are moments of joy throughout. There are funny bits that are more cartoon-like in a slapstick way. There's some funny business where Dumbo and Timothy get drunk on a barrel of wine, which leads up to the magnificent \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" sequence.If you were to take that scene and release that as its own short, it would a masterpiece on its own. It's like it shifts into a completely different film. This scene predates most psychedelic and surreal animation, which leads younger people to assume that the animators were on acid. Truth be told, they were not, they were using their imaginations and being very creative. It's not that hard. It was produced a good 25 years before the psychedelic era anyway.A 10 out of 10.

The film definitely has its moving moments, but it's not as entertaining as it should be. It's too earnest for a cartoon feature. Although the (extremely weird) dream sequence is the most widely praised, my favorite part has always been the delirious clown sequence: two hugely enjoyable minutes, with hilarious surrealistic jokes and perfect comic timing.

It tells the story of the mute baby elephant Dumbo as he goes through a series of trials and humiliations before learning to fly and having his ears insured for a million dollars. Quaint. Charming and quaint to be sure.What you can fault this film for, however, is its racism. Musical number 'Song Of The Roustabouts' which depicts a gang of African-American work- hands is awful by today's standards and was pretty horrendous even for the time (\"We work all day/ We work all night/ We never learned to read or write\"), I mean do you really want to be showing your kids this stuff? Not to mention the gang of shady stereotypes who croon out the regrettably catchy When I See An Elephant Fly (sung by Cliff Edwards and The Hall Johnson Choir as \"when I see a elephant fly\").It just strikes me as rather odd that in this day and age we still throw this stuff in front of our most impressionable minds and don't have the forethought to think about what's actually on screen. A group of faceless black men who's only purpose appears to be working for the man is really not the sort of thing that I want my kids to be told is normal. Yes, some might explain it away as a product of the times, or simply ignore it under some half-formed 'the magic of Disney' excuse, but the fact still remains that at least two of the major sequences in this film are prime examples of insidious racism.Still though, as an adult this film does have its merits. I mean, the Pink Elephants On Parade sequence is certainly inspired if a little terrifying, and the animation, while generally basically constructed, has its moments of stylistic grandeur. When Timothy Mouse's shadow throws out its Nosferatu shadow a la F.W Murnau, for instance, was a real delight to see. It also has the interesting historical distinction of being the second of only two classic Disney films to have had their backgrounds done solely in watercolours (the other being Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs (1937)).But, overall I've got to say that Dumbo really isn't one of the finest achievements to ever come out of the Disney studious. The storyline is, to be frank, utter nonsense and is poorly executed with the thing jumping from sequence to sequence with no real rhyme or reason. Nevertheless, there'll always be a small fondness for the floppy eared pachyderm in my heart (and I'm willing to bet the hearts of others), and for early animated cinema it is a considerable landmark.

They are funny and happen to be black, not black and therefore funny. There's a difference.

I can chuckle at Chico Marx's pseudo-Italian because there's no insult intended in most of his movies--he exaggerated and put a funny spin on what he'd seen growing up.

These are minor details, but the main issue I have with the film is the tone. It goes from being very happy and Disney like to very dark and sad and then at the end from sad to happy again. The tone of a movie, animated or not should always be defined within the first few minutes of the film and there are some major tonal inconsistencies here. Also, there are some weird stereotypes in the movie and I understand it was released in the 40's but it also feels weird. Like the workers of the circus who put up the circus tent are all black and the first words to come out of their mouths are something like \"We work all day, work all night.\" I'm probably paraphrasing though.

It was made on a relatively low budget, in a short amount of time (probably because of World War II which is noticeable in the film in almost a propaganda-like way in the end of the film). The quality of animation is definitely not Disney's best (with many of the backgrounds being rough shapes, circus workers without faces, using shadows to portray people in tents, simply drawn line characters), but this proves to be unimportant. The story is simple, entertaining, and incredibly emotional.The film is about a precious infant elephant who is made fun of for his big ears which is where he receives his nickname Dumbo. He is part of a circus troupe with his mother who is taken from him after protecting him from mockers.

Ironically, it's also one of their finest. With Disney's 'nine old men' working on other projects to hopefully re-vamp the studios financial prospects, Dumbo was developed by Dick Huemer and Joe Grant, two of Disney's founding fathers, who took an unconventional approach to adapting the story from Helen Aberson's children's story. Written almost like a book, the film's charm and appeal lies in it's no frills approach.There's no heavy-handed morality message, just a simple tale about a cute elephant with a physical affliction trying to get by in a world that will not accept him. In fact, away from Jumbo Jr., cruelly dubbed 'Dumbo' by some unsavoury elephants, and his only friend in the world Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy), Dumbo's world is full of unkindness. The faceless men who run the travelling circus Dumbo is apart of, do little but hammer and build with a depressing resignation. The other elephants, apart from Mrs. Jumbo (Verna Felton), refuse to accept him due to his comically large ears, and do everything to ridicule and exile him. There's no moment of realisation for these characters, just a satisfying pay-back.It's strange that this is rarely mentioned as one of Disney's finest. Perhaps it's the lack of musical numbers or the use of silent-era slapstick and facial humour as opposed to the usual quipping sidekick. But for me, this enhances the enjoyment, putting more focus on the wonderful animation, and reducing the story down to something we can all relate to. Much has been said about the crows encountered by Dumbo towards the end of the film, and their racial stereotyping. I will not deny that some of Disney's early output do leave a nasty taste in the mouth, but, in fact, the crows are part of a select few who are sympathetic to Dumbo's plight, and Dumbo feels too innocent to be accused of such.

Who hasn't ever felt like the titular elephant, lonely and outcast? How many of us haven't realized we need no magic feather to unlock the potential within ourselves, so as long as we have confidence and faith? It's a beautiful theme.The only drawback to Dumbo are the infamous crows.

These little fellows have caused much debate, with some people seeing them as harmful and some - perhaps surprisingly - seeing them as helpful. Though they are clearly walking caricatures, they are mostly sympathetic and more than one are actually voiced by a black actor. Their inclusion doesn't feel malicious in any real way and their representation isn't as backwards as a lot of similar stuff from the era or, for that matter, Disney's own collection. 'Dumbo (1941)', as a whole, is still one of the studio's absolute best. It's short, sweet and full of charm, effectively telling its simple tale of a bullied elephant who - and I don't think this is a spoiler by now - discovers that the source of his unwarranted ridicule also allows him to fly. The film is fun throughout, brought to life with wonderfully energetic animation. One of its stand-out sequences is its infamous 'pink elephant' dream sequence, which plays out like an impressively surrealist art piece. The picture is also genuinely affecting; its 'baby mine' song easily, yet sincerely, tugs at the heart and is, quite clearly, the thing's most emotionally resonant moment. The movie isn't a dour experience at all, though, and it achieves its balance of character and fun remarkably well. For a silent protagonist, Dumbo himself is oddly compelling. He's charming and carries the plot exactly where it needs to go, remaining one of Disney's most memorable heroes despite the fact that his journey is very down-to-earth and, ultimately, small.

Not saying it is bad, it is not at all dangerous to children, but a few of the ideas and themes in the film are shocking, especially for a Family Picture, making this one of the greats.First off, Dumbo being separated from his mother is one of the worst things that could happen to a young child.  Seeing his mother take action against the children at the circus can be a bit frightening. And seeing her in the cage is such a sad sequence.  The Crows that help Dumbo are stereotypical of African-Americans, but it *was* made in 1941. Watch \"Holiday Inn\" and tell me if the crows are still too bad.You can't write a review of \"Dumbo\" without mentioning the psychedelic \"Pink Elephants On Parade\" sequence, brought on by Dumbo's drinking of wine. This sequence is reminiscent of the \"Huphalumps and Woosles\" in \"Winnie The Pooh\" or the cards in \"Alice In Wonderland\" or basically anything in \"Fantasia.\"Finally, Dumbo learns that he can fly at the end and does... and uses his power to get revenge on those that have wronged him.

After the financial disappointments of Pinocchio and Fantasia a year earlier, the studio tightened its belt on Dumbo in an attempt to make up for the losses. It worked in one sense, giving Disney the box office victory it needed, but that penny-pinching and corner-cutting hurt the finished product. It's astonishingly short, barely weighing in at an hour including credits, which forces a sudden, jarring climax. The story's pace is quite smooth until then, taking its time to build characters and back-story, so by contrast the immediate rush to wrap everything up in a frenzied flash is disruptive. While it's cruising along in the first half, though, things are good enough. Speckled with colorful characters and a fresh circus setting, it bottles that classic, emotive Disney magic while still taking a few risks. The infamous pink elephant scene, in particular, is an unexpectedly surreal animator's playground that's several decades ahead of the curve. I was shocked to find offbeat similarities Danny Elfman's work in the film's score, too, which may suggest an even broader influence.

It's only over an hour long, and the main character is silent. It's a simple story about an outcast trying to get along in an unjust world with the help of an unlikely friend. It's simple, to the point and the underlying message touched me more than it ever did as a child.Disney's fourth animated classic tells us the story of Jumbo Jr., or Dumbo. Dumbo, the large eared, big hearted child of Mrs Jumbo, is ridiculed by the rest of the elephants at the zoo. He's very close to his mother, and is devastated and left alone when she is locked away after defending her son from a nasty little boy. Rejected from his kind, and the laughing stock of the circus, Dumbo is befriended by Timoty Q Mouse, who sees nothing wrong with the youngster's apparent disfigurement. With Timothy's help, the silent elephant learns that it matters not what one looks like, but what you're made of, and that you can learn to use your weakness as your vehicle to achieve greatness.Dumbo himself is just adorable. I love silent characters like this, who convey emotion through action, expression and noises. He says so much by saying so little. I loved him.The message of hope in the face of adversity is profound and done beautifully here. It isn't hammered in. It teaches us not to judge on looks alone, but to look beyond it. An age old lesson, but done here so well that it feels fresh and new. As someone with disabilities, this film touched my heart; Timothy is truly what a great friend should be. If there was more people like him, we'd have far less problems in the world. The relationship between Dumbo and his mother is just lovely, and the song \"Baby Mine\" made me see how much I love my own mother. I feel for little Dumbo; my mother is my rock, and if I lost her I don't know what I'd do. He's a brave little guy, no doubt.It surprised me that the humans and circus workers didn't seem to hate Dumbo at all. It was all the elephants (and that one boy who took it too far). Your own kind can me much crueler than others.The animation is beautiful, especially the little details they added such as rain and flags blowing in the wind. I was pleased that the animators showed Dumbo and his mother rocking side to side after being separated; this is a tell tale sign of depression in elephants.The music is lovely. I've always liked the choir in these older Disney films. In the opening song, they mentioned my hometown, County Cork, which surprised me a great deal. The crow scene didn't bother me in the slightest, I actually found them quite funny. It's a product of the times, and they sing that awesome song. The Pink Elephant scene dragged on a bit too much for me, but the song was cool. I better mention that there's flashing lights in this sequence.The length of the movie is perfect.

Watch This Animated Film And See For Youself.", "This is one of the most memorable cartoon film I saw as a young boy. It introduced me to a lovable character that I'll cherish forever. The character is an adorable baby elephant with blue eyes and ears which are longer in proportion to its body, which eventually enable it to fly.Jumbo Junior is its name. However it has the nickname of Dumbo.Plot: While circus animals are being transported, Mrs. Jumbo, one of the elephants, receives her baby from a stork. The baby elephant is quickly taunted by the other elephants because of his large ears, and they nickname him \"Dumbo\".Once the circus is set up, Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper at a group of boys for making fun of her son, and she is locked up and deemed mad. Dumbo is shunned by the other elephants and with no mother to care for him, he is now alone, except for a self-appointed mentor and protector, Timothy Q. Mouse, who feels sympathy for Dumbo and becomes determined to make him happy again.The circus director makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt, but Dumbo's ears causes the stunt to go wrong, injuring the other elephants and bringing down the big top. Dumbo is made a clown as a result, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo hates this job and is now more miserable than ever.To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his mother. On the way back Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup so Timothy decides to take him for a drink of water from a bucket which, unknown to him, has accidentally had a bottle of champagne knocked into it. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become drunk and see hallucinations of pink elephants (the famous Pink Elephants on Parade sequence).The next morning, Dumbo and Timothy wake up in a tree. Timothy wonders how they got up in the tree, and concludes that Dumbo flew up there using his large ears as wings. With the help of a group of crows, Timothy is able to get Dumbo to fly again, using a psychological trick of a \"magic feather\" to boost his confidence.Back at the circus, Dumbo must perform his stunt of jumping from a high building, this time from a much higher platform. On the way down, Dumbo loses the feather and Timothy tells him that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as the stunned audience looks on in amazement.After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager, and Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the circus train.A famous song in the film \"When I See An Elephant Fly...\":I saw a peanut stand, heard a rubber band, I saw a needle that winked its eye. But I think I will have seen everything When I see an elephant fly.I saw a front porch swing, heard a diamond ring, I saw a polka-dot railroad tie.

The simple film only cost $813,000 to produce, half the cost of Snow White, less than a third of the cost of Pinocchio, and certainly less than the expensive Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release; it and Snow White were the only two pre-1943 Disney features to turn a profit. It was intended for Dumbo to be on the cover of the December 1941 issue of Time, but the idea was dropped when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, resulting in the United States entering World War II and reducing the box office draw of the film.Dumbo won the 1941 Academy Award for Original Music Score, awarded to musical directors Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace. Churchill and lyricist Ned Washington were also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song for \"Baby Mine\"10/10 points.

This is one of the most touching, short, perfect films ever. Nobody should have to pass their childhood without seeing it.The story is incredibly simple. It isn't cluttered by subplots, it doesn't have more than one story line, it's just a straightforward fable of how a baby elephant rises to fame, but not before being ridiculed for his foolishly immense ears, named Dumbo, and worst of all being ostracized from his mother. But he is rescued by Timothy Q. Mouse, a fast-talking rodent who is the one guy who pities Dumbo. In the end, Dumbo finds his ears are perfect as wings. After the animators so perfectly portray his innocent joy, we see a great change in Dumbo. He suddenly punishes the clowns who made fun of him, shoots peanuts at the nasty elephants like a bombadier circling overhead. I know everyone who was punished for their horrid conduct towards the mute protagonist deserved what they got. But still, I can't help thinking: Is this really Dumbo? I would have expected him to just smile joyously and simply speed-dive into his mother. I just didn't seem like the kind of guy to punish wrongdoers. That's what most heroes do, they beat up the baddies, but Dumbo seemed more like the kind of character to mind his own business, content to be with his mother and not be picked on, not giving a hoot whether the rest of the world ran amok or not.Despite the last bit, I love Dumbo. The animation is very rounded, warm and welcoming. The cuteness of Dumbo knows no bounds. This is made even more noticeable when Dumbo's ears are revealed when he sneezes, as they were previously tucked back neatly. After everyone sees his ears, the scenes don't look quite so happy. After his mother tries to protect him from a redheaded brat, Skinny, she's labelled \"mad elephant\" and locked up. After the loss of his mother, all the layouts are dark and sad, reflecting how Dumbo feels. Even the circus' obligatory brightness seems in some way menacing, although the look isn't really different at all. The animation is very simple, not bothering with great detail, but just portraying a cartoon animal, without the added bother of fur, wrinkles and such like.The character of Dumbo is groundbreaking. It's a great achievement to make a pure, meaningful film without the title character uttering a single word. The medium of animation often expresses emotion better without verbal support. Add to that that the movie really emphasizes Dumbo as an innocent baby who isn't responsible for his long ears, and dialog would ruin the baby image. What makes the meanness of the outside world look even worse is the fact that Dumbo can't even say anything about it. Timothy is a great character. That's nothing more than what you'd expect, for mice are always portrayed favorably in Disney, for obvious reasons. You just love him for helping Dumbo when no one else will. He's also quite the talker, persuading the ringmaster to use Dumbo as his climax, and bringing a bunch of nasty Afro-American crows to tears with a dramatic rendition of Dumbo's tragic story. Which brings us to the crows, presumably cousins of the vultures in The Jungle Book. Both are outcasts themselves, both make fun of the outcast hero before accepting him with an excellent song and then helping him. Mowgli and Dumbo develop friendships with their feathered acquaintances the same way.No one could ever talk about Dumbo without mentioning the \"Pink Elephants On Parade\" sequence. A year too late to make the cut for Fantasia, but certainly a surreal, colorful, innovative sequence. It's one of the best animated sequences ever, with lots of strange shots, like when you only see highlights of two waltzing elephants. Timothy and Dumbo endure this nightmare after accidentally imbibing the clowns' champagne. The crows' song \"When I See An Elephant Fly\" is one I battled with for a long time, trying to get it out of my head. I failed, needless to say. \"Baby Mine\" is one of the most touching sequences in animation history. The eyes and and the trunk (!) of the two elephants express the mother and son's feelings far better than words. All Dumbo can see of Mrs. Jumbo is her trunk, which cradles him through the bars of Mrs. Jumbo's tiny cell window, as he cries.Okay, enough of the sadness and despair, the movie! Dumbo is one of the great Disney movies, immortal. Short, simple, basic, yet spectacular in its own simple way. It doesn't try to be Fantasia or Pinocchio. It doesn't go for extravagance. It doesn't wanna be the immortal masterpiece. It just aims to tell a good animated story.

Sure, they punch our \"cuteness\" buttons, but this movie has more to it.  Only 'Hercules' has done such an reflection of the Disney machine at work.Something like a spoiler warning...This movie really sums up prewar America.  Anyone who thinks this is a sweet story is blind.  Consider:--Heavy racial stereotypes.  The crows are obviously Blacks (as is the gorilla) so Ralph Bakshi used that theme for his 70s satire.  Compare this to 'Remember the Titans' where the crows were the victims and the \"white boy\" was only a miscellaneous outcast.--Listen to the lyrics of the working Roustabouts.  Probably the most depressing Disney music until 'Song of the South'.--The frequent militarist themes and images, some directly taken from 'Triumph of the Will'.  Remember that Disney was one of the largest distributors of nationalist propaganda during WWII, one such mascot was Dumbo.--The circus is tyranny and the gossiping elephants (\"proud race\") are Nazis.  So, Dumbo's escape and triumph becomes all the more patriotic. Orwell copied this for '1984'.--Having lost his mother, Dumbo gets drunk, hallucinates and has one heck of a hangover.So where does Disney invest itself?  The \"search for a climax.\"  This was after a few financial travesties so Disney needed a savior.  The story itself was a freak to the writers and barely got to Walt as it was.  What makes this good?--Modern Disney musicals are constructed in the MTV fashion of flashy colors and cuts.  Up until 'Little Mermaid' the method of music was appreciative meditation.  Just examine the \"Baby Mine\" sequence, a far cry from anything we've seen in the last 15 years.--Because Dumbo doesn't talk, he is reliant on expression like few other Disney characters.  The only other one that pops to mind is the Golden Eagle in 'Rescuers Down Under'.  These represent the epitome of the Disney design team.  Notice how the art is focused on the eyes.  Now compare it to the repressed designs of the Disney princesses, it seems Disney is better at animals when they don't have to worry about them speaking.  From here we get 'Luxo Jr.' and Phase IV.--Early use of morphing animation during \"Pink Elephants\".  This is still effective after 60+ years.  Sure, Gerald Scarfe used it in 'Pink Floyd', but it's not until the recent advances in computer technology where morphing has become more common.  Now who will change our outlook on the process?--In the finale, Disney completes the circle by flaunting the publicity machine (something they've exploited ever since) and announcing 'Dumbo: The Movie'.  'Bill & Ted 2' used the same gag in its credits.With those in mind, this goes on my Top 10 Disney films and it has nothing to do with sentimental attachment.  Well, maybe it does.

I watched this film recently with some grandchildren and the youngest ones were bored with the film before halfway into it. They soon lost interest and went off to cavort or do some other things. A teenage granddaughter stayed with it and said it was one of her favorite movies.There seems to be a difference in children brought up a mere 15 or so years apart. While kids have had cartoons and children's movies and TV since the beginning, those things have changed over time. Except for the bona fide learning TV programs (alphabets, numbers, etc.), most of the fare geared to young children even on TV and in the movies is of the fast-paced variety. Lots of action, comedy, excitement. So, the slower older films such as \"Dumbo\" soon become boring to modern-day children.In this case I have to side with the youngsters. Maybe it's because I knew the story and the outcome, but I too found this film very slow watching it these many years later. Perhaps some of the older films, especially the animated, once considered classics are just products of their time and not enduring masterpieces. I'm sure \"Dumbo\" will be around \u2013 as long as some semblance of the Disney operation exists. And, maybe future generations will prove its durability.

Short, simple and sweet. It made perfect sense for Disney to adapt this story. Many regard this as the essential all-rounded animated classic from their canon. Sure, it harnesses that Disney sparkle, but boy oh boy do I have some major issues with this. A stork delivers a baby elephant to a circus elephant, who is then cruelly named Dumbo due to his big floppy ears. Now an outcast, he befriends a mouse who discovers that Dumbo can actually fly.A pivotal plot characteristic for this semi-anthropomorphic, that we only discover during the last seven minutes. He shocked the audience at a circus knowing that he didn't need a \"magic feather\" to fly (it came from within...you just got to believe!), reunited with his mother and chugging along the circus train happily ever after. All that, in seven minutes. And that is my biggest criticism. The animation is only an hour long. So much of it is wasted on inventive visuals, most notably the drunk sequence and the elephant pyramid stunt, that the central story of Dumbo is constantly stopping and starting. Frustratingly, there are some really tender moments. When his mother cradles him whilst being locked up, it brings out some much needed emotion and parental themes. The subtle commentary on animal cruelty being unfairly used at circuses for entertainment. The parodying of elephants fearing mice. The over-the-top antics from the clowns to bring some hilarity.There are good moments in this, all weighed down by that ticking runtime. Everything felt underdeveloped. The musical numbers were unmemorable (\"When I See An Elephant Fly\" probably being the most famous). The voice acting somewhat hit and miss. Oh, and let's not even talk about the stereotype casting of the crows. The film just feels outdated. More so than any other Disney animated classic. That's not to say Dumbo is bad, because it's not. Self-confidence is an important and engrossing theme. It's just not the essential Disney film that many claim it to be."], ["A True Classic, My Personal Favorite", "for me, 'Dumbo' is the quintessential Disney classic and personally, my favorite of all Disney films animated or otherwise. i consider 'Pinocchio' to be Disney's ultimate achievement in filmmaking and 'Dumbo' to actually be his second best, but 'Pinocchio' is too disturbing and full of a lot of moralizing and archetypal imagery to be actually charming and fun. 'Dumbo' has it's dark and sad moments, but it's basically a pretty funny cartoon and is a lot more light and spontaneous than \"Pinocchio' which often reveals little more than it's dark, troubled nature. the imagery in \"Pinocchio' is also more heavy handed.if you don't know the story to 'Dumbo' that's your loss. it's a film everyone should see and a lot of people have. so there's little need to go into any detail about the plot. most people know it's about a baby elephant with big ears who can fly.also, as anyone who's seen it knows, there are many lessons to be learned here. mostly distressing ones, but interesting life lessons to contemplate none the less.'Dumbo' had the lowest budget of any Disney animated feature from the past. i think that was a asset. on a larger budget 'Dumbo' would have been too pretentious or heavy handed. simplicity is what this little story needs to fly.it really is a funny, charming little cutie. it's about little circus animals, baby choo-choo trains, a teeny mouse who saves the day, and about how every child had a mommy. even if you never knew her, you had one. it's also about nasty circus clowns and smart alecky black crows.if there is anything to for parents to be cautious about, there's, of course, the casual consumption of smoking and alcohol often found in older cartoons. there is also the fact that 'Dumbo' is also somewhat of a revenge scenario at the end and might inspire certain types to entertain retaliation. as for racism? of course not, that's stupid. any kid who has ever seen a rap music video or the Wayans black films nows how a lot of black people can act and this depiction is not very different from any of that.everybody should jump aboard the Casey Jr. circus train and experience the circus with 'Dumbo'. no matter how old you are you just might get something out of it. not all of it's pretty, but it's always cute and ultimately very funny."], ["I want an elephant for myself!", "When I was a kid I remember I loved to watch \"Dumbo\".

So, today, after many years, I watched it all over again. And I was mesmerized. \"Dumbo\" is adorable; every time he was sad I has to control myself so much not to cry with him. And when he smiled I just wanted to hug the computer screen. Plus, this talks about judgment: we usually judge people by their looks and that is wrong; very, very wrong. Dumbo was fooled by everybody because of his ears and, in the end, he became the most important animal in the circus. Other thing that the movie talks as well, is the way how some circus, sometimes, treat animals. I hate circus with animals: animals belong in the wild and, if for some reason they aren't able to return to the wild, they belong in a zoo or some kind of reservation so they can live their lives in the happiest way possible.

I enjoyed it at the time, even though I didn't know exactly what it was about. I don't recall watching it any time after that while growing up, so my memory of it was fairly vague before I watched it for the first time in ages earlier this year. When I finally did that, I was impressed enough to give it an 8/10. However, after another viewing very recently, I can't give it a rating higher than 7/10.Mrs. Jumbo is a circus elephant who gets a baby delivered to her by Mr. Stork. When this baby arrives, she names him Jumbo Jr. The other elephants like this newborn, until they see that he has abnormally large ears, which causes them to ridicule him, and dub him \"Dumbo\". Sadly, it gets worse for the young elephant. Circusgoers begin to torment him, and when his mother tries to stop this, she ends up being locked away. Now separated from his mother, the only one who cares for him, and shunned by the other elephants, things are going terribly for Dumbo, but fortunately, a good-natured mouse named Timothy quickly becomes his only friend, and begins to help him become a successful performer. However, this isn't the end of Dumbo's troubles.\"Dumbo\" is only slightly over an hour long, which is pretty short for a full-length movie. Apparently, it's the shortest full-length Disney film ever made. Because of this, you would think it would be easier to keep it consistent, but there are Disney flicks that are much more consistent than this one, even though they are obviously longer! There are several good things about this 1941 animated feature, including some catchy songs, poignancy, and impressive animation for the time. There's also a bit of humour, though not as much as there often is in Disney animated features. The funniest part is probably where Dumbo and Timothy accidentally get drunk. Personally, despite these merits, I had trouble staying into it the entire time.After over 65 years, \"Dumbo\" is still often considered a classic. Personally, it's not one of those in my book, but many would disagree. Many have adored this movie through the decades, I'm just one person who has been slightly disappointed by it. While it's not something I would want to watch over and over, I think it's still a good animated family feature, and I don't advise anyone to avoid it like the plague, other than those who strongly dislike Disney movies in general.

The truly remarkable thing is that nearly seventy years have gone by since this film was first shown, yet the central theme - somebody's life being one long miserable struggle because of a physical defect \u0096 is still totally relevant. How many kids face daily humiliation because of the size of their ears, the colour of their hair, a blemish on their skin, a problem with their eyes, the appearance of their teeth, or their weight? \"Dumbo\" is a story to bring hope and warmth to every person who has ever felt self-conscious, and to heap shame upon any person who has ever victimised another because of how they look.One night, the animals of a travelling circus show are brought babies by the storks. But for an elephant called Mrs Jumbo it is a sad night. As she watches all her friends get their new babies, she slowly realises that the storks do not seem to have a tiny elephant for her, even though she was expecting one. The next day brings a wonderful surprise though. A stork arrives \u0096 better late than never! \u0096 with a baby elephant for the despondent Mrs Jumbo. She is overjoyed and proudly announces that his name will be Jumbo Jr. Then, the little baby sneezes and from the side of his head unfurl the most impossibly big ears that anyone has ever seen. Pretty soon, Jumbo Jr. is the joke of the circus, laughed at and ridiculed by all, and cruelly nicknamed Dumbo by the other female elephants. One day, some mischievous children visit the circus and tease Dumbo; when Mrs Jumbo reacts violently towards them, she is taken away and locked in a cage away from her baby and the rest of the circus. A determined circus mouse called Timothy befriends Dumbo, and promises to make him a star. After many misfiring attempts to fulfil his vow, Timothy finally hits upon the inspirational idea of using Dumbo's massive ears \u0096 perfect wings, as he calls them - to achieve flight. Overnight, Dumbo goes from being the butt of everyone's jokes to the world's first flying elephant, a celebrated star of the circus and the most remarkable animal on earth!It's hard to know where to start when recommending this film. The animation is marvellous for the time, and the voice acting is simply superb. Edward Brophy as Timothy and Sterling Holloway as the stork are particular stand-outs. The film has some catchy songs, the best of which are the now-classic \"Elephants On Parade\" and \"When I See An Elephant Fly\", the latter brilliantly performed by a bunch of comical crows.

The fact that Dumbo and mother are non-speaking characters is a blessing; the sequence plays beautifully with expressions, eyes, shadows, movements, all lovingly animated by masters.

The music was now maddening, the sets seemed very flat at times, and the story is practically non-existent.Really there are just a couple of sequences where the animation is really special, the drunken sequence and the flying sequences.

I can only vaguely remember the Crows and their motivational speech, or the awe that we experienced when Dumbo started flying like a jumbo jet. The characters are fairly forgettable, but the animation on them is exciting and even creative in terms of the pink elephant hallucinations. Upon hearing rumors that a live-action Dumbo was coming out within a few years, I realized that yes, Tim Burton could give some improvement to the characters and also give the visuals a boost. The original is well worth your time, though my expectations were only slightly exceeded."], ["Effective at being emotional but sometimes insensitive", "The story of Dumbo (1941) is one of those classic films that most children do not go without seeing at an early age. At the time Disney was having financial troubles. Although Fantasia (1940) and Pinocchio (1940) were critically acclaimed, both failed to bring in a profit for the animation giant. Interestingly enough the screening of Dumbo (1941) did the exact opposite and even managed to be made during an animators' strike during the current time. Like a lot of the other Disney films, the iconic elephant would become apart of the library of assorted characters to represent the Disney company. The only thing that sets Dumbo apart from other Disney mascots is just how many people and fans remember him more than others. He probably comes 2nd or 3rd to Mickey. For this to stick that much there must have been something in the film to make it hang around so long in the conscious of the viewers.That something is what goes into this story's writing penned by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer. The story is about a newborn elephant with ears larger than normal being brought into the world by mother elephant Mrs. Jumbo. Yet with his ears being abnormally big, the name Dumbo ends up being his new name by the local snot nosed gossip circus elephants. Upon one show, locals begin to make fun of Dumbo, which enrages mom causing her to be separated from him. Feeling sad and alone, Dumbo befriends Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy) who sympathizes and wants to help him. There are two main components that work in the script. The first is the mother/son relationship between Dumbo and his mother. The other part is the life lesson of never stop believing in oneself and to never let others bring you down. Dumbo in some ways parallels that to an early version of WALL\u00b7E (2008); where the main character does not have much or if any dialog. This kind of writing isn't always effective because it's harder to portray emotions on a verbal level but that's not a problem here.Dumbo is one the sweetest little characters a viewer could watch. There is literally nothing to dislike about him. He's possibly even more innocent than Bambi (1942). Watching him interact with his mother is one of the sweetest moments in childhood history. It is this element that demonstrates how important a mother is in a child's life. As for Timothy Q. Mouse, he represents the self-preservation part about moving forward in life and not letting anyone stop you. If it were not for Timothy, who knows how long it would've taken Dumbo to get out of his slump of being mocked. Timothy is actually an underrated mouse icon and should be the second mouse to think of other than Mickey. However, even with these strong points there are some moments of question as to why they were even considered to be included. For these scenes, they involve the pink elephant sequence and racial representation.During a moment when Dumbo has the hiccups he accidentally takes a drink out of bucket that contains booze and gets loopy, which then induces him and the audience into a trippy sequence about pink elephants. From a particular viewpoint the scene does make sense, which is distracting us so we're thrown off guard when the scene ends, but from another point of view there really is no other significance. It's just a scene that gets a bit weird over time and may give some kids nightmares. As for racial representation Dumbo and Timothy meet a group of crows that are drawn and talk like African Americans at the time (as media had thought). For both situations it's understood that more adults viewed cartoons at the time and the way African Americans were portrayed in cartoons was much different, but both don't excuse for how that turns out now. Yes, it is all apart of history but it is still insensitive. Children nowadays watch this and could get the wrong idea. If these parts were managed in a less insulting way there'd be more to give slack on.For this movie there was no head of production. There were seven different directors for this feature; all of which handled different sequences. Nonetheless they all are directed as if it were one person. The animation headed by Art Babbitt was well crafted too. All the movement on each character and objects were fluid and smooth. For a Disney film like this, nothing but excellence is expected, otherwise it would not be considered among the memorable films. The music composed by Oliver Wallace and Frank Churchill was an addition to happily hear. There are several tracks that are recognizable and are catchy to listen to. The main theme for Dumbo is heroic and brave sounding with that classic mid 1900s sound of horn and string. Other tracks like the odd \"Pink Elephants\" and jumpy Casey Jr. train tune are catchy and memorable too. It's not perfect but it is still an enjoyable piece of film work.Unfortunately due to the time of its release, the film suffers from racial caricatures and adult content involving booze. It's not a huge anchor but it does feel insensitive. Thankfully the adorable main characters, effective writing, creative animation and memorable music help even things out."], ["Well, haters gonna hate", "The title does not mean I HATE this movie. I love it and I find it cute, but you learn from this film that even if you are the cutest elephant ever, there will always be someone (or many in this case) that despise you. This movie sets a good example for the \"haters gonna hate\" saying. It teaches you that you can always prove them wrong no matter what flaw you have or if you are constantly bullied. This movie has one of the best meanings out of any movie and I can see why so many people can relate to the pain that Dumbo went through, just because he has those giant ears.The only thing that I do not like about this movie is the timing. I do not want to watch a 64 minute movie with such an amazing message. And the flying sequence should be a lot longer and become a part of the central conflict which is the \"haters gonna hate\" thing.

Adding Timothy Mouse for the talking was a clever touch. \"Baby Mine\" is heartbreaking and I was nearly in tears. I can hardly believe Dumbo was a cheaper film to make. Sure it's shorter than the others but I've found that shorter movies are just as good, sometimes better, than longer ones. The only issue I had with Dumbo was the abrupt ending. He learned to fly and then it was over. But even that all wraps up nicely.People don't usually pay much attention to Dumbo but I think they should.

In the case of Dumbo, it is far better to have someone speak of it as \"dark\" than to hear the moniker \"dated\".The critique of \"dark\" can be one of the hugest compliments an animated film can receive, because you can judge by that its amount of cowardice in presenting the human (or animal, if you like) predicament, as compared with standard children's fare. But it is an inaccurate label for Dumbo, which has one of the most optimistic endings on record.The fact is, the dark makes the light more beautiful, more triumphant, and more moving. The dark is the true rendering of obstacles in the path of the hero, and Dumbo is perhaps the greatest animated hero ever. If you saw Dumbo's amount of \"darkness\" presented in a live- action film, you would complain that it was insubstantial fluff, that it blows off into the wind, never to be seen again.Dumbo will never blow off into the wind. It is on a straight course through the history of the best, most dramatic, and most inventive cartoon features ever."], ["Over-sized Pachyderm Sound Sensory Organs Prove up to the Task of Creating Sustained Lift & Drag, acting like the Upper Limbs of Avian Cousins!", "At our house, years ago while this writer was one of 5 young Ryan Kids on Damen Avenue, a virtual Holiday in our House whenever there was a Walt Disney animated film released, be it new, or especially a Classic Re-release. There was always great anticipation from the day we received the Great News, until the Great Day(usually Saturday or Sunday Matin\u00e9e, of course).At first, our Older Sister, Joanne (1942-1990), was in charge of any family excursions, our folks would pass on the chance and $ave a few Buck$ in the same day. (With 7 mouths to feed in the house, every little bit helped!) We had already seen PINNOCHIO, BAMBI, Cinderella, SNOW WHITE, THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW and THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS, when DUMBO came up in the rotation. It was an instant success, being a good example of a Walt Disney Animated film. And, yet it stood alone, having a certain unique feel all of its own.The story, based on a kid's book, DUMBO THE FLYING ELEPHANT by one Helen Aberson, was bright, quick moving and a delight. There is not a scene, nor even a frame of exposed, animated film that doesn't help in propelling the story forward from beginning to the Fairy Tale-like Happy Ending.It has been said that Mr. Disney did this DUMBO as a feature in order to offset some of the production co$t$ that were incurred with the costly SNOW WHITE, PINNOCHIO and (especially)the \"Concert Feature\", FANTASIA. Accordingly, more expensive techniques, such as the use of the 3 Dimensional Effects of the Multi-Plain Camera, would be held to a minimum. It would seem to have the tendency to give the finished product a \"cheap\" look. Quite to the contrary, the rich color work and lively animation work, it is really not noticed in its little over one hour running time. (64 minutes, to be exact.) And when these more elaborate processes were applied, the result is outstanding and even to the point of contending to be called the finest example of this Multi-Plained Camera effect. Take for example the fine aerial scenes of our little Elephant with the Crows. Certainly the nocturnal view of the star-studded sky full of countless 'twinklers',is unmatched in any other film. That sky that we view when little Dumbo is taken by Timothy Mouse to visit his shackled, caged Mother must be ranked as a high-point in Animation History.Of all the elements that go into animated sound film, the first to be considered have to be the \"Voices\"; the actors who will give life, personalities and that all important Anthropomorphism to the animal characters. Contrary to a commonly held misconception, it is the dialog comes first, not the action.* In DUMBO, the Disney Production team provided us with as fine an array of actors to voice our story.The cast of characters follows, with no one given as DUMBO's voice, as the little Pachyderm did not speak, giving him the distinction of being the one and only Disney main character to be mute throughout his film.(Dumbo's Mother, Mrs. Jumbo, says only one line. In telling the Stork the Baby's name she says, \"Jumbo, Jr.\".) So we begin with veteran comic relief man, Ed Brophy, who gave Timothy Mouse a sort of \"street tough\" Brooklynese accent. High pitched and smooth voiced Sterling Holloway does the 'delivery man', Mr. Stork, leading the other Elephants in \"Happy Birthday to You\". Verna Felton gives the cattiest of personalities to the lead female, the Elephant Matriarch. Herman Bing lends his very German accent to the Ring Master.** And 'Ukelele Ike'(Himself), Cliff Edwards, provided the vocals, both talking and singing, for Jim Crow, the Leader of the Negro Charicatured band of Crows.(more about that later) The rest of the cast is filled out by the following: Deep Voiced (former BIG BAD WOLF)Billy Bletcher, Jim Carmichael, Noreen Gammill, Eddie Holden, Malcolm Hutton, Harold Manley, Tony Neill, Dorothy Scott, Sarah Selby, Billy sheets, Chuck Stubbs, Margaret Wright, with Hall Johnson & The Hall Johnson Choir;and featuring the Narration of John McLeish.The use of the band of happy-go-lucky Crows portrayed as Negroes, may be a little out of line with what is considered to be proper or \"Politically Correct\" in today's world. But, alas, the whole sequence is done in fun and without any insult intended. And it is with the aid of the Crows, that Timothy is able to convince Dumbo that his big ears are able to be flapped repeatedly to create the lift and drag proportions needed for a sustained take-off and flight.As for emotions, like all Disneys, DUMBO certainly \"hits for the cycle.\"*** We experience Joy of his \"Late\" Arrival/Birth, the dismay and disgust at his ridicule and rejection by the Elephants, and the shock, alarm and sheer horror at his Mother's being Chained and solitarily confined. The shame of being relegated to a member of \"Clown Alley\".But we experience the joy, jubilation and tears of a triumphant laughter when the former \"Clown\" proves his talents and stands vindicated, triumphant and hailed as a World Famous Hero.NOTE: * An Animated Cartoon in which the sound, both dialog, music and sound effects are added after the filming, is known as being \"Post Synchronized\", of which Disney's STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928)was one.NOTE:** I had thought that it was the voice of Sig Ruman. But it doesn't disappoint.

The black crows are portrayed as lazy, comical, and entertaining. One may also note the substandard English grammar used by the crows. The black crows, unfortunately, were an obvious depiction of black men at the time the movie was created. The film was created in the 1940's, a period during American history in which no one could escape the hideous face of racism.

I'm convinced that Disney had to tear us down just so they could build us back up, my goodness, we are Disney Marines! Bambi is one of the training videos to make us tough, because if you can make it through this film without crying that proves that you have no heart and are dead inside. Bambi despite being one of the saddest movies of all time still has a lot of heart and is one of the best in the Disney classics. With it's beautiful animation, charming characters and breathtaking story this is a movie that no one should miss.In a forest thicket, a doe gives birth to a fawn whom she names Bambi. After he learns to walk, Bambi befriends Thumper, a young rabbit; then, while learning to talk, Bambi meets a young skunk whom he calls \"Flower\". After Bambi has completely learned how to talk, his mother takes him to the meadow, a place that is both wonderful and frightening.

But prepare to be jolted out of your seat.  The forest contains darkness as well as light.  The gunshots that ring out across the silences are truly alarming (and there are many ways Disney and Hand make them more alarming: consider the scene where a flock of birds are cowering in the grass, until one decides to fly into the air and risk death rather than put up with the suspense).  Also worth noting about `Bambi' is its use of psychological colour.  In at least three key scenes, the colour scheme shifts wildly, not because the sun has set or anything of that kind, but in order to illustrate Bambi's psychological state.  Particularly fine is the scene where he is running away from the clearing in fear and the world turns into just a few pale and dirty shades of yellow.The greatest thing is the way Disney manages to convince us that there is nothing else in the world, outside the forest.  Not once do we see a horizon.  Nor do we sense one.  By some standards not much happens in the forest - a few deaths, a few births, what else is new?

I found that while this movie certainly has a heart for its characters, it is not at all sugarcoated about the realities of animal life. Consider the following points it makes:1) Animals do not live in nuclear families.   Bambi lives with his mother only, his presumptive father is off in the background.2).  Animals often go hungry in the winter.3).  Male animals must be prepared to fight rivals as a prelude to mating.4).  Man (here assisted by canine lackeys) is easily the most dangerous threat creatures face.Rather than putting a Hollywood gloss on animal life, \"Bambi\" if anything is better than what would be made today.  Remember that the same studio recently put Hercules into a doting nuclear family, the actual circumstances of the hero's birth apparently thought too scandalous for contemporary children to be exposed to (though one presumes ancient Greek children handled them well enough).Plus when you consider that a large sector of the populace takes a \"humanity couldn't possibly be at fault\" attitude toward the decimation of animal populations, you know that Point 4). above would today be softpedaled if not entirely neutralized by the addition of sympathetic human characters.

You can mention \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Lion King\", any Disney's acclaimed masterpiece, still, nothing can beat the good old animation drawn by hand and on that level, watching \"Bambi\" is like admiring the 'Mona Lisa' of Animation. The American Film Institute recognized \"Bambi\" as number three in its Top Ten Animated films right after \"Pinocchio\" and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". I guess, the pioneer deserved the top spot if only because without \"Snow White\", there wouldn't have been \"Bambi\".And the progresses made between the two films are tremendous; look closer to the animal designs, in the former they look like animated creatures from short cartoons, while \"Bambi\" doesn't focus only on aesthetics but also on scientific exactitude. The film doesn't forget to be simply Animation, but the realism of the landscape, the drawing, everything makes it hard to believe that it was made only five years after \"Snow White\". \"Bambi\" is a tribute for the inspiring level of perfectionism that elevated its animated movies at the same level of Hollywood's greatest masterpieces, it's a tribute to Disney's ambitions as a true film-maker, as he never took anything for granted. Every successful film was an encouragement for making a better one and after \"Bambi\", it was naturally impossible to make something better. It's not surprising that the film closes what we refer now as Disney's Golden Age.I don't want to make \"Bambi\" sound only like a technical achievement, after all, even as a kid, my eyes and my heart were grabbed by the story. But now, as a grown-up, more familiar with today's animated films, I see \"Bambi\" with constant marveled eyes, I can turn off the sound and never cease to be amazed by how it look, or I could close my eyes and simply let myself transported by the music. \"Bambi\" would never work today, because animated films are marketed for a different audience, eager to see fast-paced action, hilarious sidekicks, lager- than-life villains and catchy songs. These are the must of Animated films and it's interesting to note that \"Bambi\" handle these elements with a sober maturity that would put most kids to sleep now. I can't believe I'm saying this, me who is 40 years younger than the film.\"Bambi\" was made in a time where people had a reason to see movies that was beyond the idea of entertainment. Audiences wanted to be transported in another dimension and to be emotionally engaged, their eyes marveled by a dreamlike world that transcends the banality of their life. Just look at the beginning of \"Bambi\", certainly the most haunting of all Disney overtures. From the first frames, it feels like a camera is filming a forest, it's a long traveling shot in a foggy, misty, dark setting we would never leave until the end. The audience is respectfully invited to penetrate the world of Bambi, quietly discreetly, until the first animals wake up to see the New Prince, then we follow them with excitement. \"Bambi\"'s opening sequence echoes the beginning of \"The Lion King\" in a much more intimate way, and when we discover the newborn Bambi sleeping beneath his Mother, we share the same impression than the animals.In many ways, \"Bambi\" reminds of \"The Lion King\" and vice versa, but while \"The Lion King\" was a sort of Disney take on typical Shakespearian themes, \"Bambi\" doesn't embarrass itself with a specific plot, but for me, what has often been pointed out as a flaw happens to be the film's most defining force. \"Bambi\" doesn't tell a story because \"Bambi\"s main protagonist is not Bambi, but Time, Time is as present as Man although both can't be seen, and the whole film consist for us to witness the passing of time in Bambi's. Bambi is the central character but not the core of the film, which helped to deal with a story without needing pointless foils. His best friends, Thumper and Flower are real friends not supporting sidekicks. \"Bambi\" is a movie about time, inviting us to contemplate time's effect on animals, nature. The way each season is portrayed through music and colors is simply magical.And \"Bambi\" ends just like it started, it's indeed the 'circle of life' with a scope so large that we can't even talk of a coming-of-age story: from the beginning, Bambi learns how to walk, to talk, he discovers this strange feeling we call love. And the toughest lesson the Prince of the Forest had to face is the one forever engraved in the traumatized minds of generations of children and adults. \"Bambi\" doesn't have a plot, which makes every piece of action absolutely powerful. After the first entrance of Man that interrupted the deer's ballet, there is one 'bang' that warns us about his presence. And when the Mother, who tutored Bambi for the two thirds of the film, feels Man's presence, she immediately covers her son by running behind him. The last shot of Bambi jumping followed by the fatal sound is one of the most brutal, shocking and admirably powerful displays of violence in a film, and the sadness that comes after the beautiful sacrifice is impossible to describe.This is the most disturbing death in a Disney film, and probably in any film, a necessary pivotal device in 'coming-of-age' stories but never equaled with this intensity. Disney created a villain even scarier because he was off-screen and his presence only identifiable with an ominous theme, doesn't that ring a bell to you, cinematic fans? Well, I guess no one can review \"Bambi\" without evoking the most characteristic and memorable part of the film, but needless to say that \"Bambi\" is more than that, a unique experience to be enjoyed because there would never be another film like it..."], ["The last film of Disney's Golden Age", "Bambi (1942) is often sneered at by contemporary film goers my age. In their minds, outside of the death of Bambi's mother, the film is a cutesy little joy ride about a happy little deer and his happy little forest friends frolicking about grassy meadows. They also find it much too slow and lacking in plot for their interests, instead switching on the film's spiritual successor The Lion King (1994), which most of my generation holds up as the greatest animated film of all time.No offense to The Lion King, but it doesn't even come close to touching the greatness of Bambi. Outside of a few whimsical moments, this is a dark film about the cycle of death and life. It's more of a meditative piece than a traditional narrative, which will not appeal to those who absolutely require a detailed plot. The animation and backgrounds are breathtaking. Like the other early Disney features, there's strong traces of German expressionism in there (ex. the fight between Bambi and a rival deer is mostly shown in silhouette and violent colors, Bambi and Faline's dreamlike run through the meadow, etc.).The atmosphere is not as cutesy as people recall. There is an undercurrent of dread to the whole thing, a sense of danger. As beautiful and enchanting as the forest can be, it is also dangerous. The way man is handled in the film is surprisingly mature: instead of putting the main characters against a laughable caricature, mankind's presence is unseen and feels more like a natural disaster than a living entity. In fact, Bambi might be one of the most adult films in the Disney animated canon. Ignore its saccharine reputation and give it another look."], ["Excellent Disney classic", "This is one awesome animated movie. If there are people out there who don't love this movie, they either have hearts of stone or bricks for brains. This is a simple, charming and heartwarming tale of innocence and the joys of youth. It doesn't need slam bang violent action or hokey bad humor. This movie, instead, flows naturally. The songs are also great, not the big, overblown affairs that modern Disney likes to do nowadays. They are charming, well sung and well scored, and more than one is about love. The movie itself seems to glow with a light so pure, it's almost angelic. The characters are also great. Bambi, Thumper, and Flower are adorable and well developed characters. The things they do and say will melt your heart. And not a stupid sidekick in sight. While this movie might not be as popular or as grand as Snow White or Pinocchio, grandness isn't usually such a good thing. Both of those movies don't have quite Bambi's charm or innocence, and both stop just short of being rather sadistic, Snow White especially. This is my second favorite animated movie, with only The Fox and the Hound topping it in my heart. I recommend Bambi to any Disney lover. They don't make them like this anymore. This is a perfect family movie.

Disney, the great innovator, toyed with surrealism in Pinocchio and created a sublime blend of music, dance and visual splendour in Fantasia, both released in 1940. With Bambi, Disney observed the quiet balance of the natural world and the troubling emergence of man. While it may contain an ensemble of cutesy talking animals with kids' voices and scenes that will have you saying \"awww!\" out loud, Bambi is pretty heavy stuff at times.We begin with the birth of a young prince, the wide-eyed, white- tailed deer Bambi (Donnie Dunagan), and while this opening may ring a bell with anyone who has seen The Lion King (1994) - which is everybody - Bambi is not near-mythical royalty with a destiny laid out for him. He is viewed with extreme curiosity by the other woodland animals, including enthusiastic young rabbit Thumper (Peter Behn), and they giggle as they watch the awkward deer try to stand up. As his protective mother teaches him of the dangers of the forest, his new friends teach him how to leap over fallen trees and ice-skate. Bambi doesn't so much have a plot with a beginning, a middle and an end. Instead, it's simply a portrayal of life, and the discovery, learning and danger we all come to face.The seasons change along with the film's tone and Bambi's increasing maturity, and the colder it gets, the closer you get to that scene. A few near-misses practically confirm that the doting mother isn't going to be around for long, but the moment still packs a punch even on repeat viewings. Brutally, the incident happens off-camera, and Bambi is informed of her death matter-of-factly by his stoic father. It's an incredibly brave and creative approach, and one that deals with the harshness of real life with incredible maturity. It also sums up Bambi perfectly - observational, unpatronising and thoughtful - but it will certainly warm your heart as well. Disney is frequently criticised for sugar-coating and over-simplifying our world, but I would point anyone in the direction of the corporation's earlier works, particularly Bambi, for elevating animation to a cinematic art-form."], ["An enduring classic", "Bambi is one of Disney's greatest...About the life of a young newborn deer and the triumphs and tragedies it endures from birth until adulthood..Quintessential Disney that is a must see..Released in 1942 so there are some WW 2 metaphors if you read between the lines  (or it may just be me) One of the greatest family films of all time..on a scale of one to ten...1030 out of 37 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Unique Animation That Still Looks Great", "The watercolor-type animation in here is tough to beat, even almost 65 years after it was made.

And , describing the often harsh education of a newborn , especially dealing with his friendship with an equally young rabbit called Thumper, a ground-drumming hare that unexpectedly proving to be the star of the show, and both of whom accompanied by a sympathetic skunk .Superbly made action scenes with spectacular scenarios and breathtaking chases along with a witty dialog , all of them combine to provide an excellent movie and impressive appeal .

Not while I'm around!Anyway, this famous and popular film is about a little fawn/calf (young red deer are called calves and he might be a red deer) called Bambi, who is learning to live in the forest with his mother and two main friends to play with, Thumper and Flower. Also, Bambi is not just any fawn/calf. He's the young prince! Will he manage to take his rightful place as great prince of the forest?I love and have loved this film for about 90% of my life.

They are the only baddies you see on screen - and I like that.So if you haven't watched this classic, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING THEN? Watch it, you're guaranteed to love it! :) ;) :()"], ["Appealing, Thoughtful Animated Classic", "The characters and story from Walt Disney's adaptation of \"Bambi\" still hold up as well as they ever did. The animation, likewise, still looks very attractive and detailed. It's understandable if the animation in itself doesn't strike everyone now as being particularly impressive, given the many recent achievements in animation, but in itself it is an excellent job with the resources of its time. It all makes for an appealing and thoughtful classic that is still well worth seeing.The main characters are well-chosen, especially Bambi himself and the always-engaging Thumper. Some of the best scenes are simply those of the various animal friends playing together \u0096 the scene of Thumper and Bambi on the ice being perhaps the most endearing of all. The change of seasons is used to great effect, both aesthetically and in advancing the story and its themes.It's pretty interesting to contrast \"Bambi\" with \"The Lion King\", by no means to decide which is 'better', but rather to take note of the slightly different ways in which they handle some very similar material. Both present the story of a young animal 'prince', the way he explores and learns about his world, and the ways that he must adjust to the tragedies and challenges of adulthood. There are also a number of other interesting similarities. Bambi is at once the more innocent, yet also the more somber of the two.One very interesting difference is that the greatest threats in \"Bambi\" come from humans, who are wholly external to the world of the characters, and over whose actions the animals have no control, whereas in \"The Lion King\" the threats and conflicts are all amongst the animal characters themselves. Both movies deserve to be ranked among the very best animated features of their eras, so there's no need to prefer one over the other \u0096 it can just make for even more interesting viewing to notice how these differences help to give each of the two movies its distinctive character.\"Bambi\" is the kind of movie that can stick in your mind for many years, especially if you first saw it when young. The characters and many of their adventures make it very appealing, often even adorable, and yet it also portrays some of the most serious (and frightening) things that can happen in the lives of the young. It's a fine movie that accomplishes a lot, and it has held up quite well over the years."], ["One of Disney's greatest animated classics", "Bambi is a remarkable film that captures the innocence and beauty of life, its challenges as we get older and nature being disrupted and damaged by \"Man.\" Bambi is one of the shortest feature films ever but what it lacks in length it makes up for in depth. The animation in this film is extraordinary every setting looks like oil pastels on canvas as we see the wonder of nature with its waterfalls, trees and beauty of animals and plants during the various changes in nature.Bambi is born in Spring a time of rebirth and beauty as leaves come return, flowers bloom and the world awakens from winter's cold grip. We see Bambi struggle to walk as he always falls down and as he tries to talk which are extremely humorous and give him the characteristics of a baby. We see his friends Thumper and Flower interact and have fun w/ Bambi and their innocence also builds up their happiness and bliss as their like young kids wandering around in the beauty of spring and the forest around them which protects them from harm. The dynamic Bambi and his mother share are poignant also as we see her nurture and instruct her son on how to act, walk and be around other animals and the love they exude for each other is also a shining staple of maternal love which again gives us a genuine attachment to this story .However, as Bambi grows his mother takes him to the meadow where we 1st observe the threat of \"man.\" His mom warns him not to rush onto the meadow and soon we 1st hear \"Man\" coming as the colors in the scene suddenly shift from light to dark as the forest are suddenly being overwhelmed by fear and chaos. Man's theme is a haunting piece of music that can only be matched with its power and intensity by Bernard Herrman's extraordinary score in Psycho and Carpenter's Halloween. Both movies capture horror because we don't know who is behind the actions in the film and why they're happening. By not showing \"man\" the viewer is terrified cause man's identity is unknown and they kill and torture animals for no apparent reason.As we move to Winter, the animation is gorgeous particularly the scene of Bambi and Thumper on ice. The wonder of this scene is the use of snow which is striking much like the thunderstorm sequence in how nature can be so beautiful and dangerous at the same time at different times. It's also ironic that in winter, as Bambi and his mother are out grazing at grass that man's theme comes and as his mother realizes what's going on she orders Bambi to the thicket. He makes it but as we discover she doesn't murdered by \"man\".While this scene is tragic and sad, it's a bit over-hyped as the \"most tragic moment in film.\" The fact that this was the 1st time Disney showed us a realistic moment in life when someone dies and nothing can alter this and that it occurred just as winter was ending perhaps gives this scene the tragic feel and notoriety it's gotten over the years. The fact that Bambi's mom ran behind him intentionally so to shield her son from harm is the true heartbreak of this scene : Sacrificing your own life so your child can have a future.As Spring comes again, we see Bambi ,Thumper and Flower as adults terrified of falling into \"twitterpating\" or love as owl describes it. Sure enough they all do and in Bambi's case its with faline the doe he met in the meadow as a child. We soon see the spring breeze of petals and song cascade as Bambi and Faline fall in love and Spring again gives birth to something love and beauty. But as the warmth continues, Man appears again with their campfire and Bambi is warned by the prince of the forest that man is back in greater numbers. Here man's theme becomes so unnerving as the sound grows louder and louder as the animals flee into the forest and it's as though we hear the footsteps of man creeping in to kill anything in their path.The gunshots come and once more the color scheme changes as nature is being killed and hurt by \"man. The fire which may have been intentionally set by man wipes out the forest and nearly Bambi and his father who barely escape along with other animals in the forest. At the end, Spring returns and bliss and happiness return as leaves and trees are growing back, and a new generation is coming to see Faline give birth to 2 new fawns .Bambi isn't a perfect film and its flaws are somewhat stark especially how Bambi becomes and adult full of bliss only months after his mom dies. This simply makes no sense and for me damaged my connection to these characters and kills the film, until it picks up when man returns to the woods. Also the scene where Bambi and the other deer fight over Faline while dramatic, is odd because we have no background to who he is(Bambi 2 explains this.) Also after her death, Bambi's mom is never mentioned again which is odd cause Bambi seems to have no issues dealing with her demise. It's a shame cause up to the death of his mom, Bambi is a perfect film and these flaws make this a very good, but not GREAT film.However, this is a shockingly simple moving and poignant film of human innocence, growing up, sacrifice and the horror of people who'll murder and destroy nature and humanity out of greed or sport. If someone ever asked me to see a film that captured the fear of how \"man\" is corrupting the world around us, Bambi would be my unanimous choice."], ["Life In The Forest", "Walt Disney's classic animated film about a young deer named Bambi, the prince of the forest, who tries to find his legs(and place) in the forest with the help of his friends Thumper(a rabbit), and Flower(a skunk) and of course their female counterparts to be enchanted by.

Films like Pinocchio and Fantasia had cost the company a lot of money due to the unavailability of the European market because of the ongoing World War II. The budget for Bambi wasn't as large as it had been for Pinocchio, but Bambi also didn't do well in the box office upon its release in 1942. Although Pinocchio received a lot of praise from critics at the time, Bambi wasn't received well. Critics noted that Bambi didn't feature enough fantasy elements, which was something Disney films were most known for. The film also wasn't received well amongst hunters. Raymond Brown, editor for the magazine 'Outdoor Life' stated in a 1942 edition of the magazine that Bambi was the worst insult ever offered to American sportsmen, due to the portrayal of 'men' as the villain in Bambi. Does that mean that the 5th Disney full-length animated feature is a bad film? Absolutely not!Bambi is based on the book 'Bambi, A life in the woods' by Felix Salten. The film starts with the birth of Bambi, the prince of the forest. Bambi meets some new friends like Thumper and Flower. Thumper is a bit of a rebellious character who attempts to learn Bambi how to make as much fun as possible. The film focuses a lot on the changing of the seasons. Bambi's born in the spring. In the summer, Bambi's mother takes Bambi to the meadow for the first time. Bambi isn't aware of the dangers that await him there, as his mother warns him to always be careful. Bambi is introduced to a female deer named Faline. He encounters his father, the great prince of the forest. The great prince discovers that the hunters have come into the meadow. The deer flee back into the forest. By the time winter arrives, Thumper attempts to learn Bambi how to ice-skate, although without much success. The food for the deer starts to become scarce, as a hungry Bambi asks his mother why winter seems to last so long. When the first grass pops out from under the snow, his mother takes Bambi to the meadow to eat some of the new spring grass. However, men arrives in the meadow again and while Bambi keeps on running back to the forest, he's unaware that his mother has been shot. His father meets him and tells Bambi his mother will not return. By the time Bambi returns, it's spring again, although it's unclear how much time has passed since the last scene. He's now an adolescent and meets his friends again. They eventually all fall in love. Bambi, of course, falls in love with Faline. Men shows up again and they set some parts of the forest on fire. Bambi has to escape, but he wants to find Faline first. He gets attacked by a pack of hounds. His father ultimately manages to save him and tells Bambi he must get up and so he does. The film ends with Faline giving birth to twins as Bambi takes his father's place as the great prince of the forest.Bambi is one of the most realistic features in the Walt Disney collection. The portrayal of the forest animals seems to be very realistic. That's probably because Disney's team observed wild animals to get an accurate idea of how they live their lives. That's exactly what a lot of critics disliked about Bambi. They found it too realistic without enough fantasy in it. I disagree with them. The simplicity of the story and the realistic imagery is exactly where Bambi's strength lies. Bambi is quite dark compared to the earlier Disney classics. Everybody knows the infamous scene where Bambi's mother gets shot. It is a powerful scene and something you usually don't see in a Disney film. Well, you don't really see it, but you know it when it happens. Men is the villain in Bambi and that's also very unique and strikes a chord with reality, because to these animals, the hunters do form a big threat. The characters are simplistic yet very likable, the songs are really good and story works really well. Bambi might not be the best film produced by Disney, but there's no doubt it's one of animations finest."], ["A love story", "People frequently say that the death of Bambi's mother is the scene most people cry in. You would have to be to be incredibly shallow and insensitive not to cry. Its a pretty good test of a person and I am so pleased that all these years later I still blubbered like a baby. Bambi looks wonderful and time has treated Walt's favourite film very well.Visually the movie is stunning. All the more remarkable in that it was made in 1942. The scenes of the animals in the meadow enjoying the airy freedom away from the safety of the forest lifts your spirits; it is just beauitiful. The music is brilliant and that rain drop song with the beautiful visuals is a glorious moment in film making. Indeed all the music is wondrous; the score for the fire is rich and exciting. The characters are wonderful. I love the much malinged American skunk, a truly remarkable little creature.I love Flower but Thumper is worthy of the recognition he has got over the years as one of Walt's greatest creations. There are so many wonderful scenes in the film. I love the raindrop scene, the parade and introduction of the stags. Bambi's father is a great creation, almost spiritual. The movie never speaks down to children and the final scene as Bambi's dad disappears is so gracious and beautiful. I love the images in the courting of Bambi and his girl friend. Bambi is a love story and its impossible not to be touched by this magical story. It has always struck me as odd how any one could kill or shoot wild animals and call it sport. Such people are obviously mentally unstable and certainly uncivilised. I dream of a day that recreational hunters get what they deserve. They are the most unworthy people on the planet.Bambi is a lesson in life and its a film that will live for ever as a masterful example of great animation. I really prefer it to the Pixar of today."], ["A real tearjerker!", "Bambi is short, but I don't care, because so was Dumbo, which is also very sad but beautiful, however I have always preferred Bambi despite the fact I could really empathise with Dumbo. Bambi is a gem, and overshadowed slightly by the flawless Beauty and the Beast and the stunning Lion King. This classic is right up there with the greats, and was coincidentally Walt Disney's personal favourite. The animation is unparallelled. Those shots of the forest at the beginning were just extraordinary, and it was so colourful and stylised. Another plus was the orchestral score which was so beautiful, that alone reduced me to tears. It matched the animation beautifully, which seldom happens in animation. The characters were both funny and touching, and the story simple and timeless. I laughed so much at Thumper, when he was teaching Bambi to speak. Bambi was great to watch too and so adorable, and I was among the majority who cried when his mother died, because this film was so educational thanks to her. The animals as adolescents aren't quite as appealing as when they were children, but Bambi and Faline's romance was one of the character highlights. The best aspect for me, was that they made the enemy so mysterious. We hear about them, and see what they do, but we don't see them face to face. That is what made the characters so appealing to the audience. This is one of the few films, where you care for everybody you are introduced to. In conclusion, a funny and ever-touching underrated classic. 10/10. Bethany Cox"], ["Walt's crowning achievement", "You'd have to have a heart of stone not to fall for Bambi. For me, it's Walt's crowning achievement, and when I watch it today, it still gives the same feeling of nostalgia as it did when I was six years old. In fact, I find even more thought-provoking than I did when I was a child.But what is it that makes Bambi stand out for me? There's magic here alright, but not the fairy magic like in so many other Disney films. There's humans, but they never appear on screen. I think that I was captivated by the way the musicians, the animators and the artwork all become synchronised, like the natural sounds of a real forest. What makes Bambi so wonderful is the feel of being so close to nature. During the scene where it starts to rain, we see Bambi's fascination with the little raindrops. As each little drop lands softly on something, we hear a little note from the orchestra. It is just so well synchronised, and it shows just how much love and dedication was put into it.Also, Bambi flawlessly flips from mood to mood. We watch a scene that is sad, dark and melancholy. It all fades to black, and we are greeted with something light hearted, colourful and joyful. In many other films, something like that would stick out like a sore thumb, but somehow, in an almost magic way, that does not happen with Bambi.What really annoys me is when I see people bash Bambi and call it 'anti-hunting pro-PETA trash.' I'm sure that when dear old Walt made this, he had nothing of the sort in mind. It also annoys me when I see people making a big deal out of one of the most touching and heartbreaking scenes in Bambi. (you know the one I'm talking about!) Sure, it's a poignant scene, but it is also only one tiny fraction of the actual film. So why must people take the Mick out of it, if there is no Mick to take? (That doesn't sound right!)If you are fed up of the huge amount of CGI that's lost its novelty years ago, then pick up a two disc Special Edition DVD of this lovable classic, before Disney locks it up again."], ["A Child's Introduction to Death.", "Bambi (1942): Dir: David Hand / Voices: Bobby Stewart, Stan Alexander, Cammie King, Peter Behn, Paula Winslowe: Symbolic Disney animation about a fawn named Bambi born to discover everything new and interesting in the world around him.

Cammie King provides the voice of Bambi's future mate Faline. Paula Winslowe provides the pivotal role of Bambi's mother whose fate is long past being a plot spoiler. It is a teaching tool but not for the intended audience. Parents may wish to view this film with their children since its adult themes are solid.

This film is beautifully animated and directed by Dave Hand (Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs).My favorite scene from the film are when Thumper is teaching Bambi how say \"bird\" like teaching a foreign child (no matter from which country) English. I also when Bambi first meets Faline. Even to animal kids boys have their issues with girls.

I was surprised by the realism of the drawings and the unsentimental view of nature as often a harsh and unforgiving thing. There was humor, but no overwhelming cuteness; instead, the interactions of the young animals was just like children playing together.The voice talent was excellent and the whole effect was to create a moving and timeless story. It seems clear that The Lion King was drawing heavily on this film for inspiration.I never expected to be as impressed by this movie. I saw it for the first time recently at the age of 54, and now realize why it has always had such impact on viewers.

The animation is just stunning and makes \"Pinnochio\" and \"Snow White\" look like they have skewif animation. Quite possibly THE most funniest part of \"Bambi\" is when Bambi, Thumper and Flower quickly fall in love with their female counterparts, while the most saddest is when Bambi's mother is shot and killed and poor Bambi is left wandering in the blizzard looking for her when he runs into his father.

I love Thumper's \"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\"My favorite scene in the movie is \"Twitterpated.\" I especially love Bambi's moment...so cute and sort of the way I imagine some romances to start...boys's backing away and have to be kissed before they realize what love is...The scenes and situations are so innocent, even a three year old could watch them. Of course there are a couple scenes that are pretty sad - characters die...but that's real life. Things die and they stay dead...I think that's a lesson that is often missed in today's movies.No matter how old you get, you can continue to enjoy this Disney classic!"], ["There never has and never will be another film like Bambi, it is unique and timeless!", "Yes, this is my second comment on \"Bambi\". My first, now deleted comment was only a reaction of my surprise, how captivating, moving, and impressive this movie was for me, when i saw it again in 2005, more than 30 years after i saw it for the first time as a child. In the meantime, i saw it approx. 20-30 times again and due every seeing, it reveals more of its depth. So i started a exploration to find out more about it: The technique, art, Walt Disney and all the other man behind it... The essence of all is quite simple: It is, in every aspect, a monument of pure poetry and pure art! It contains only approx. 900 words of dialogs, in which was more said than in many books with 1000 pages, with a runtime of 70 minutes, it contains more depth and epic than almost every 3-hours film. It is a story about the life himself, with all the light and all the darkness.It's not a fairy tale. There is no princess to be rescued, no spell to be broken, no villain to be defeated. It contains not a typical storyline. It don't need such trivial things! It was not forced toward by \"what happens next\" suspense, it flows like the seasons, it goes on with the power of nature. It is the first and the truest circle of life, that Walt Disney created. \"Bambi\" was often called the \"typical Disney film\", but in fact, it is the most non typical Disney film! Whoever ventured in became part of an experience so strong that neither heart nor mind could ever forget it's impact!Disney and his crew didn't translate Felix Salten's Book literally into film. This was impossible due the huge differences between the technique of storytelling in a book and a film, but they catch the inner spirit that Salten described. It took more than 5 years of hard work to find the right way in transforming the book's soul into a film. And the way that they finally found was perhaps the only way that pay the highest homage to Salten's book.You may be disappointed, because there is no really a plot in it (this is according to Salten's book too; it is more a collection of incidents, that enabled the young fawn to learn the profound lessons which in time made him the wisest deer in the forest). It may be boring for some people when they saw it for the first time. But if you submerge in it, you will explore a whole new world. So forget all about story lines and plots, common in almost all movies. Let delve yourself by the gorgeous opening scene into Bambi's world! Align your expectations to that of the young fawn. It may be look so mundane, when Bambi starts to discover the world around him. The flowers, the rain, the other animals, but every new discovery is a revelation. It is the same adventure, that all of us have experienced in our childhood.Later, the world starts to reveal his somber side. The first time on the meadow, when Bambi must run away from the hunters. The first fun in the wintertime turned into the danger of starvation for the deer. And then, right after the first fresh spring grass evoke new hope, follows on of the most iconic scenes in movie history. It is a perfect off camera-scene and the turn point of the whole film, a symbol for the end of childhood and innocence for our young hero. For many young children (and for me too, when i was 5 or 6 years old and saw \"Bambi\" for the first time) this seminal scene was the first experience, that the world can be very cruel... it took more than a half century, before Disney dared a similar scene in \"The Lion King\" again.\"Bambi\" was often criticized as an \"anti hunting movie\". But is this true? No. Felix Salten, author of the book \"Bambi\", was a hunter too Perhaps only a hunter that is common with all the animals around him can wrote such a penetrating and deep story. The whole story was told trough the eyes of the animals. Man was not a typical villain with a goal, i.e. to conquer the world, to be the king or something else. Man was more like a deadly force majeure, a storm, a volcano or an earthquake, and his acting was a riddle for the limited minds of the forest creatures, and when Disney decided to let Man unseen in the whole movie, he strengthen the feeling of a dark menace.\"Bambi\" did not need a common plot nor need it sophisticated dialogs too. The story was primary told with music, colors, light and impressionistic color-shifting to depict Bambi's inner feelings rather than words. Bambi's forest is a powerful and truth, yet poetic and ethereal interpretation of the forests of our dreams...and sometimes of our nightmares, too. \"Bambi\" connecting art and poetry with reality in a way that has never seen before and never seen again. It is a movie that follows his own rules, a awesome work of art, that is comparable to Mozart's compositions or to the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci!\"Bambi\" gives the most honest, gritty portrayal of the full range of art, poetry and emotion in the history of cinema. It moves you, it let you laugh, it let you cry, it let you fear, it gives you hope. It is a film about friendship and the strength of character, and about the spirit of life!There never has and never will be another film like \"Bambi\", it is unique and timeless.

The animation is brilliant and couldn't be better and the characters are just terrific. I only have one reason why I cannot give the film a score of 10--in the original Felix Salten novel, Bambi's mother was NEVER killed by hunters! So, Disney chose to terrorize the children of the world by introducing this traumatizing story element--one that wasn't 100% necessary for the plot. Such a radical and nasty change always has confused me and this is THE reason why I don't recommend the film to young kids.

Tape) and I wasn't wowed. Since I'm reviewing all the animated Disney movies, I had to watch it again. This time, it enchanted me.Bambi is a young deer, son of the Great Prince of the Forest, known as such for being the oldest and wisest deer. Bambi grows up in the forest under the watchful gaze of his loving mother, while learning how the world works with his pals, Thumper, the rabbit, and Flower, the skunk. Life is tranquil in the forest, except for one thing: man. It is man who results on Bambi having to face the trials and tribulations of growing up.The movie is as simple as it comes. There's no epic adventure, no underlying message (unless it's to respect nature, I suppose). It's just the life of this deer, as he grows from fumbling fawn to a strapping young stag, facing grief, falling in love, and just living life.The relationship between Bambi and those around him, especially his mother, are kept simple and yet they work well. The focus is kept on Bambi. The dialogue is little and only used when needed. The script is well written. There are stakes in this story. Even though I've seen Bambi before, and even had a picture book as a child, I still gasped when Bambi got shot. This is the type of film that sucks you in without even trying.The characters are all lovable, and are well written, and animated well, too! The character animations and anatomy are truly masterful. The subtle movements show the passion behind every brush-stroke. The animation is timed well with the musical score, which also acts as the sound effects for the film. This shines out especially in the April Shower scene; it's hypnotic, mesmerizing and artful. The backgrounds are so enveloping, that it feels like you're one with nature. This isn't just a movie, it's a celebration of nature and all that it has to offer. The animators truly outdid themselves.Once again, the choir has me just as engrossed as the animation before me.The emotions are pure and visceral. There is no hamming up here. The children (well, if you can call them children) act thusly. Thumper is the epitome of what a child character should be; charming and perhaps a bit irksome, but lovable. I was wrong when I said there was no message: Thumper's father's saying about being nice or say nothing at all is something everyone should take to heart.What a beautiful film. Pure emotion, pure celebration of nature. A true animated masterpiece."], ["Every single frame a painting of art", "Bambi is very much my favourite of the early Disney films. It's one of the first Disney movies I ever saw and even today it's an immensely enjoyable experience to sit through.As a movie it's simplistic and beautiful. The story of a young prince of the forest being born, growing, experiencing joys and sorrows, and eventually taking his place in the forest, is not all that difficult to follow, and some might even call it seemingly boring, but there's a lot of heart in every single scene, in every single moment of Bambi's life.It's also a beautiful film in every way possible, easily among Disney's finest in my opinion. The characters and especially the backgrounds are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, the various animals move with fluidity and grace, the colours are soothing and lush, and as a whole the film is simply stunning. The music is also really good, though the film doesn't contain any memorable classics, though in my opinion Little April Shower should be considered one.Bambi is one of those Disney films everyone at least knows about, if he or she hasn't already seen it innumerable times. And for a reason. It's not grand, epic and bombastic like the Renaissance films, nor did it revolutionize anything like Snow White or Sleeping Beauty did, but its good qualities cannot be understated."], ["Visually beautiful film with well-developed characters", "This is an animated feature produced by the Disney studio. There will be spoilers ahead:This film is an adaptation of the novel by Felix Salten. It's a good deal lighter and gentler than the novel, which is hardly surprising, given as it's a Disney film. The most impressive thing about a very impressive film is its beautiful visuals, particularly in showing the changes in season and in the climactic forest fire sequence.The Disney animators spent time studying animals in order to get the look and the movements down right, giving the film a very naturalistic, realistic feel.The story follows Bambi, a male deer, from his birth through his maturation to his finding a mate and beginning the life-cycle all over again by the close of the film. The other animals are all excited by the forthcoming birth of the \"prince\" and when he's born, they all rush to see him and pay their respects. Friend Owl is a focal point throughout the film, acting as an everyman. Two characters created for the film, a rabbit named Thumper and a skunk named Flower, serve as friends to Bambi as he grows into adulthood.Bambi passes through many events in his life, including the death of his mother at the hands of man (a hunter). It's interesting that, on its release, the film attracted criticism from hunters for essentially depicting hunting as it actually is, as being a disservice to sportsmen. Bambi comes into his own and meets Thumper and Flower again after some time apart, all three grown and quite baffled by some birds who are \"twitterpated\" because it's spring and they are in love. They vow never to act so oddly, which of course they in fact do, as each meets his love in order, Bambi being last and seeing his cousin Faline again.Bambi finds himself having to fight another stag for Faline in a dramatic scene which is effectively animated. It's followed quickly by the forest fire sequence. The film ends in the same way it began, with animals excited again at another birth, this time Faline giving birth to Bambi's fawns. The ending is quite nicely done.This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth watching. Recommended."], ["The Pinnacle of Disney Realism", "Considered the last Disney film of the golden age. Pinocchio is considered the pinnacle of Disney animation and for good reason. I consider Bambi to be the pinnacle of Disney animation in achieving realism in nature. The animals look and move realistically while still retaining human personality traits and expressions.Story wise this isn't one of the most strongest films. However, the scenes with Bambi experiencing things for the first time are very charming and Thumper is one of the most adorable characters in the film. One thing I've always enjoyed about the Disney films that I've never gotten from other animated films is that the layouts and scenery always feel like a real place that I've been to. That is one thing that hooked me with Bambi; its like being right in the forest, which is Bambi's strength. Unfortunately, like Pinocchio and Fantasia, this wasn't a commercial success in its initial release due to its budget and the fact it was released during WW2 cutting off revenue.The structure and circle of life theme would be revisited decades later in The Lion King, but Bambi remains an all time classic."], ["Disney's Symphony for Heartstrings", "I think you could say Bambi has stood the test of time; just how many bittersweet cartoons can still divide opinion generations after initial release. It will outlast us all and probably continue to divide opinion, but I always try to bear in mind the intention of the words of rabbit Thumper's father: \"If you can't say anything nice, don't say nuthin' at all\".The birth of the prince of the forest, Bambi the deer is greeted with joy by the hordes of anthropomorphic animals, and much time is spent in various cavorting and learning, as time and the seasons go by. As the song goes there's a beautiful sound, but also a wonderful vision, the film is nearly perfect even with splendid non-pop music, joyous hand-drawn animation, and importantly is short and sweet. The supremely poignant moment when the perennially absent father breaks the bad news to Bambi through the falling snow never fails to impress me \u2013 but maybe luckily I never saw it when I was a kid - unless the mental trauma has been erased! The big enemy in this film so big with the Human Touch is Man (unseen, and his dogs, very much seen). I suppose they're pretty much equivalent but I've never been sure if it's supposed to represent an inevitable onslaught of insatiable capitalism or a simple manoeuvre for mindless hunting. Either way, it provides the chaos counterpoint necessary to validate the subsequent renewal and re-birth. Before they presumably will have to go through it all over again...Over the generations it's made a lot of people happy, made a lot of people think and a lot of people a lot of money, and it's still keeping a lot of people in jobs.

It is a simple, straightforward story of an infant growing through childhood to early adulthood: it just so happens that this individual is a deer (anthropomorphised, of course, and effectively being both a deer and a kindred spirit that we can identify with).Bambi's world not only encompasses his own growing up, but also the natural world he lives in, mother/child relationships, friendship, adolescence, natural disasters and - typically for Disney not to sugar the pill - the hard lesson of personal loss).Disney's animation - naturalistic, comedic, and effects - has never been better.

The beginning is extremely sad, but the rest of the film is fun and light-hearted; especially, when Bambi tries to ice skate on a frozen pond in the forest. I highly recommend this film to children ages 10 and older because there is a death scene involved, which younger children may find rather disturbing because of the connotation of death. I know when I first saw Bambi I was only about 6 or 7, maybe even 5 and found this scene to be rather sad. In conclusion, this film is a wonderful Disney classic, but recommended for children ages 10 and above due to a death scene. Children being younger than 10 if they were to see this, may become visibly upset due to the connatation associated with death. The scene is not graphic, by any means, but the idea that something has died and isn't returning to the forest may upset young children.

Certainly much can be said critically about Disney films -- sexism, racism, etc. -- but \"Bambi\" remains one of the more timeless tales. Some might object to the negative portrayal of man in this film (he kills Bambi's mother and starts a forest fire), but I don't think there's really anything controversial about how man and deer interact.

The songs are decent, and the dialog is unforgettable.

Sure, a baby deer growing up might be cute for a while, but after that while there should be a real story popping up somewhere. One with a task or a moral or anything. Instead, the pattern of growing up continues. Adocelence, love, friendship, death and so on.

I cry easily at sad films, especially at that age, but while watching this movie I never even sobbed.

There's romantic love, love between a mother and a child, and flower's \"crush\" on Bambi. Love is a big theme in this movie. Love tries to keep everything together, but it was separated two times: once when the mother's gone and another when a buck interferes, but it's part of the forest's cycle of love (just made that up). There were no computers in the 1940's so everything was hand-drawn. The animation looks spectacular and it works so well with the realism style that Disney's animators and artists were looking for. It looks well done and it's beautiful. I love that there's no CGI in this movie. Now, most animators are too lazy to draw a picture and they rely on computers to do the job. I think it has one of the best animation in any Disney movie I've seen. It's an awesome movie. It doesn't rely on comedy to make this picture perfect. The ending isn't typically happy, it just shows that the cycle starts all over again and the papa deer is away from his children just like his father was.

This proves what a genius Walt Disney was. The backgrounds were stunning, the music was wonderful as well as the songs (most notably \"Love is a Song\" and \"April Shower\"), plus the two main characters (Bambi the deer & Thumper the rabbit) were irresistibly cute when they're kids. Also, it's also makes my eyes bursting in tears when Bambi's mother dies (I rarely cry for a movie, but so far this scene is the only one that does, even though I'm 17 years old). No question, in my opinion, all of these ingredients make Bambi not only my favorite animated feature, but also my all-time favorite movie in general."], ["Story is Deep, Multi-functional and a Singularly Beautiful & Poetic Film; yet is strangely familiar in some ways! (Read on, Schultz!)", "IT HAS BEEN oft said that there are only so many plots with which to fashion a story. More correctly, the few basic plot lines can be tweaked and manipulated in such a manner as to seem to be original and truly different; but alas, when all is said and done, close examination will reveal the basic underlying energy and dramatic devices that reveal all of this basic literary DNA in the very substance and fabric of a story.AS FOR BEING able to enumerate and classify these plot lines; let's just say that this is not either our intent, nor could it be accomplished satisfactorily if we did take a half-hearted stab at it.WITH REGARD FOR today's very special guest star and literary guinea pig for our dissection and edification, Walt Disney's BAMBI (Walt Disney Productions/RKO Radio Pictures, 1942), we can only say that it is totally different in its final effect than just about anything else that we have ever had the pleasure to see. Repeated theatrical re-releases has put it into the category of the familiar and as we are only all too aware, familiarity breeds contempt; at least in a slightly varied and diminished strain. The readily available supply of VHS and DVD home video releases that are always in good supply in Wal-Mart, Sears, Kay-Bee Toys or what have you greatly increase this perception of BAMBI's being all too commonplace; hence, not being so very worthwhile.A CLOSER examination with a fresh point of view and attitude will doubtless give us a chance to come away with new attitudes.IN THE COURSE of BAMBI's roughly 90 minutes on the screen, we are introduced to the Fauna of the Forest Primeval (that's the Animals, Schultz) in many varying modes. At first we may dismiss the treatment of giving personality and the ability to express themselves as being pigeon-holed into the old Anthropromorphic bugaboo.WHILE IT IS true that the film does give personality and allows us to understand whatever communications that are utilized by the various species; at no time do any of the characters wear articles of clothing, live in human-like abodes or go to work at Mr. Slate's Construction site in Bedrock. The voice characterizations are a concession to necessity. It is the device used by Disney's crew to both impart character individuality and personality; as well as avoiding the use of a huge and excessive number of title cards. It may also be noted here that the film uses no narrator, a fact that wasn't even noticeable until multi viewings and reflection.AS FOR THE plot line, or as we Big Time Critic Wannabees call a 'scenario', this Disney BAMBI is a straight forward, no frills telling of a life in the Forest and the coming of age of its newborn crop of residents. Although it has the impact of a large segment of a lifetime, it is probably a lot closer to the 3 year mark; or whatever is the time for a newly born fawn to grow up to be an adult deer. The story is punctuated by various bumps in the road of life; with some scenes with great moments of levity, descending to some instances of true shock and horror. (Which seems to be par for the course in a Disney Full Length Animated Feature.THE INCLUSION of Hunters, their pack of hounds and the man-made forest fire are all fine hints at not the evil nature of the Homo Sapiens Sapiens, but rather as a warning about the potential danger that exists to both Mother Nature and Father Time; as well as to Mankind itself. (No, not to the Politically Correct \"Humankind\").This would seem to be a truly astute observation as well as a warning that could truly be called to be \"ahead of its time.\"AS FAR AS the animal character design, the voices employed, the backgrounds and the musical score all created for this film, we can only use the highest degree of superlatives in each case. Special mention must be made of the outstanding and even breathtaking panoramic views of the Forest Primeva; which have been rendered even more beautiful and impressive with the use of Disney's Multi-Plane Camera Shots. Also, the theme song of 'Love Is A Word That Never Ends' is done in a manner that seems to be so detached from the rest of the production as to be almost Surreal. In the end, though, it all comes together; as a good Disney Feature Animation should and usually does!ALL OF WHICH brings us back to our original premise. What was it about, do you remember? Now let's not always see the same hands raised!IT WAS our non-original assertion that there are just so many basic plot out there. So, which one can we effectively place brother BAMBI? There was one recurring character who seemed to be only peripheral to the story; that being the Wise Old Buck, who in-spite of the lack of a bone-fide Springer-Povich approved blood test, was no doubt, Bambi's father. He was very aloof and only 'spoke' to the young buck to tell him that mama was now venison & a wall mount trophy above someone's fireplace.(My now, don't we sound cold?)WELL IN THE last scene, an adult Bambi has taken a position up on the hill next to the Wise Old Stag, only to have his father give him one last emotional glance before the Old Wise One moves out of the scene, presumably to go to his maker; effectively and symbolically passing the mantle of Paternal Protector on to Bambi.AND AS FOR our conclusion, we think that this was similar to Michael Corleone's assuming the position of Family Head in THE GODFATHER.WE BET you never thought we'd be comparing Bambi to Al Pacino, no?"], ["BAMBI (David D. Hand, 1942) ****", "I had seen most of Walt Disney's sixth animated feature film many years ago via a local TV screening which, however, omitted the climactic forest fire sequence in its entirety\u0085which is why I am considering it a first viewing here! Technically, BAMBI is certainly among the most accomplished works ever to come out of the famed animation studio: the level of artistry on display is so high that one scarcely believes that what he is watching is actually 70 years old and made under wartime conditions to boot! Frankly, the main story of BAMBI is pretty bland and can't hope to hold a candle to the classic children's fables like Snow White and Pinocchio; however, the film has an alternative trump card in its winning combination of typical Disney whimsy (having all kinds of animals gather round to greet Bambi's nativity) and an unheralded documentary-like feel in its realistic depiction of forest life (witness the animals' panic-stricken reaction to man's intrusion in their territory). As a matter of fact, Disney's perfectionism in this regard made the production drag on for 6 years! Therefore, together with the by-now famous characters of Bambi the beautiful deer itself, Thumper the amiable rabbit, Flower the shy skunk and the friendly Owl, we also have some uncharacteristically bleak passages: the killing of Bambi's mother by an unseen hunter and the subsequent adoption by its princely father, the older Bambi battling a rival for its loved one's affections, the aforementioned blazing forest incident, etc. Reportedly, BAMBI was Disney's personal favorite among his feature films but, at the time of original release, it proved a box office disappointment so that the company reissued SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (1937) theatrically to recoup its costs fast \u0096 a clever tactic that has become the norm for the studio since then. Another much less sensible decision taken by the studio many years later is that of making direct-to-video sequels to some of its classic legacy and, in 2006, it was the turn of BAMBI II \u0096 which isn't even a sequel really since it centers on the relationship between young Bambi and its father!"], ["A FABULOUS FILM!

There are a few films of which I don't necessarily love, but nonetheless, I do appreciate. Bambi is not one of those films. This animated classic is spectacular. The characters are lovable and unique. Thumper, for example, takes the cake. He has the cleverest lines throughout the movie and is my favorite by far. The twitter-patted scene is adorable as well. The theme behind the film is incredibly important, and the emotional sensation one feels while watching Bambi is notable. When Bambi's mother dies the reaction is intense. It is revolutionary because it's in a children's animated movie, and it occurs so early in the film. Bambi's struggles are honest and heartfelt. The fact that Bambi has to take on so many tribulations i.e.: his mother dieing, fighting for his one true love, trying to save the forest from man's fire, taking over his father's role as King of the forest, make this film significant and ahead of its time. This film not only dealt with death, but with environmental troubles as well. I do not know of another animated film that has shown such concern and awareness. I have never met another person who appreciates this movie more than me, which is appalling. The detail and artwork are memorable and quite impressive. The subject matter and focus of this film are incredibly inventive and original. The character development and relationships are charming.

I think it's because of this that it appeals more to me (and many Disney fans) than the worlds created in the fairy-tales such as 'Snow White' and 'Peter Pan' (not that those were bad movies - on the contrary!). This is also the only Disney movie I know of where a central 'good' character - the mother - is killed, although her death is not seen.***End of spoiler warning***At the end of the film the video carries some interesting footage (featuring Walt Disney himself, as well as some of the animators who worked on the film) about the methods they used to create this animated classic. Considering what animators are capable of today, 'Bambi' is an amazing piece of work. Obviously digital imaging did not exist in 1942, and the use of 'multi-plane' cameras to create the 'layers' of forest generated images that rival, and could even be superior to, today's digital animation. Walt's meticulous attention to detail - especially in regards to animal movements - make the characters that much more believable.More than 20 years after I saw it for the first time, I'm reminded of why this is my favorite Disney movie.

In the movie genre, when the expression \"The shower scene\" is used, few if any won't know that it refers to the notorious scene on Psycho. I'm sure everyone here knows which scene on Bambi I'm refering to here. Since shock value is measured in part by what one would tend to expect in a feature up to the scene in question, the death of Bambi's mother would rank at least as high in the context of a Disney feature as the shower scene is in a Hitchcock movie.When she dies, any notion of Bambi being another cute cartoon dies with her.  I'm tempted to refer to her as the personafication of the quintessential doe. Deer-does in particular-have a reputation for being very docile & gentle(though they are by NO means limited to that disposition)and Disney's only Principle casualty does more to personify that  than probably any other deer in the movie. If she had been killed by wolves, rather than humans, the scene would have been less potentially disturbing.  One of the fascinating things about Bambi is that it does juxtapose things in such a way that makes it an inherently disturbing story.  Instead of raising animals up to our level-like Mickey Mouse-it brings us down to theirs, as if we were one of them. Then reminds us that we like to hunt them. Inherently disturbing because it fuels anti-hunting sentiments & potentially puts those who think hunting's OK on the defensive. This makes Bambi surprisingly provocative. I may elaborate more on a later edition, but what I want be be sure to add here is that humans  are in Bambi what wolves are in Red Riding Hood, what the great white shark is in Jaws, what mako sharks are in deep blue sea, & what veloceraptor is in Jurassic Park. None(including humans) are necessarily evil, but relative to the protagonists in the respective stories, they are the Enemy Species. It's an interesting switch watching a flick where we are the enemy \"beast\". Like the MAN vs NATURE conflict in reverse. Personally, I think it unwise to judge the killing of a deer as worse than the killing of a cow. Deer may be prettier, but that's a dangerous criteria for appraising the value of life. However, the fact that deer have so endeer-I mean-endeared themselves to us makes them excellent protagonists in this classic."], ["Enjoyable for little children", "I have seen this one as a kid in theater and I haven't seen it again until a few years being an adult.

Nothing has ever come close and I use this example as to why 2d animation is superior to the modernised 3d. It's hard to define what makes this film so pretty. Maybe it's the watercolours used in the background, maybe it's the use of the multi plain camera like in the opening sequence.

This was in San Diego,California and they had acquired a large reel copy to play on projector in the gymnasium. Best of all,it was free.We all sat down and the film began. I (Like any kid) enjoyed every minute of it. The animals all gathering for the birth of the \"Young Prince\",Bambi & Thumpers cute and funny moments together in play,kind of like human kids are together and the whole story of Bambi growing up in the forest.Then later,my favorite part of the movie,Bambi becoming \"twitterpated\" (in love) with Feline the Doe,who he'd met earlier and she'd teased him terribly when they were little. His buddies Thumper & Flower falling into it as well with females who seemed to take the lead in attracting.As a boy,I thought some of the songs were corny but somehow,\"Little April Showers\" managed to get my attention. Leading me to get a copy (vinyl) of the Bambi soundtrack itself. I grew to like the other songs eventually.Now,this all could have been very \"happy\" & gentile but Walt Disney knew better,the reality of the animals existence was put in play also. The harsh winters with little food,\"man\" hunting them down in the forest and on the meadow.Somehow,when Bambi's mother was shot,it didn't really resonate with me what had just happened.

(END)"], ["Still a classic, nearly 70 years later", "Bambi is truly on of the best movies that Walt Disney ever created, and for some very simple reasons. The story, though it deviates away from the book by Austrian Felix Salten, is still powerful enough to tug at heart strings, yet still appeal to young children, and with lines that make the audience wonder and laugh with the young fawn as he explores his world. The animation and the camera techniques are absolutely gorgeous, making you feel like you are in the forest this story is taking place in, long before 3-D techniques. The music is fantastic, and Disney make the most of it, stretching the music through most of the film, though the few times the score does stop, such as the first time \"Man\" enters (with the immortal line \"Man is in the forest\"), and when the Great Prince reveals that Bambi's mother had died (still one of the most emotional scenes in an animated movie I have seen), it is even more powerful.Overall, Bambi is still a Classic, and would have been better received had World War Two not closed off the European Market to American movies, along with the original lack of American interest. No movie of the present, except maybe the Lion King, could come close to matching the realism, the beauty, or the story of Bambi. It sets the bar for the genre of animated movies, and few can match it."], ["The End of The First Golden Age of Disney Animation", "In the works for several years at the Disney studios, \"Bambi\" finally debuted in 1942, at a bad time for the studio. America had entered World War II the previous year, and financial returns for Disney films were disastrous (except for \"Dumbo\", which was relatively cheap to produce). \"Bambi\" would be the last film by Walt Disney until \"Alice in Wonderland\" to display big ambitions. It was actually less elaborate than planned.\"Bambi\" is a film that has a small amount of dialogue, and because of this, it soars. The film's animation is beautiful and among the best you'll ever see in any animated film. Disney outdid himself once more on this film, and it shows, from the opening multiplane shot all the way to the final frame of the film. \"Bambi\" tells a wonderful story, of a young fawn's journey to become the Great Prince of the Forest. Throughout his life, his mother is taken from him at the hands of an unseen hunter, he makes several friends and he makes an enemy later on in life, and then he finds love.\"Bambi\" might not seem special if one hasn't seen it, because the modern Disney advertises the film poorly. From the ads, it looks like happy deer and jumping around with cute critters. They never show the dramatic act of the story with the death of Bambi's mother, adult Bambi's fight with a rival buck, the attack on the forest by a lot of hunters leading up to the terrifying forest fire.\"Bambi\" succeeds because of the drama, and it also succeeds because of the beautiful art direction and the stunning character animation. A lot of work was put into getting the anatomy and movement of deer right, and they succeeded. The soundtrack is also strong, \"Little April Shower\" starts off as lightweight pitter-patter and then it becomes a loud, booming thunderstorm of drums, crashing and loud choruses. \"Love is a Song\" and \"Looking for a Song\" work as love songs. The rest compliment the visuals. \"Spring Song\" might abruptly come after the somber aftermath of Bambi's mother's death, but it shows that Disney doesn't spend any extra minutes on melancholy and moves on in order to progress the story.A 10 out of 10. After this film did poorly when it was released, no Disney animated feature afterwards showed this level of ambition and artistry, with the exceptions of \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" (which both did poorly when they were first released). The Disney films that followed are tame in comparison, but most of the 1950s Disney animated features succeed because of their stories and characters."], ["Just simply amazing", "Bambi is simply one of the best Disney movies.

After winter is over, Bambi and his mother are eating the spring grass, when the mother senses that Man, a real danger to the animals in the forest, is near, she and Bambi run for the safety of their home. Bambi is heartbroken when he discovers that his mother was killed. Bambi is taken in by the Great Prince of the Forest, a deer that all the animals look up to. Bambi later grows up and falls in love with Faline, a childhood friend. When the forest is put in danger by Man's campfire, Bambi must save the animals and Faline. Bambi and Faline safely flee the burning forest, and that spring, Faline gives birth to two fawns. The story ends on a shot of Bambi, who was crowned as the new Prince of the Forest.When SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was still in production, Walt Disney discovered a book called BAMBI by Felix Salten. Disney loved the book so much that he decides that it would make an excellent film. The Disney artists studied the characters' real-life counterparts to make their animation as real as possible. Disney intended for BAMBI to be released after SNOW WHITE, but instead, PINOCCHIO followed SNOW, and soon later, FANTASIA, and then, DUMBO in 1941. BAMBI was finally released in 1942. This is one of the Disney Studios' best films. The backgrounds are beautifully drawn, using a lot of pastel colors. The characters are ones that stay with you long after you see the film, especially the show-offy rabbit Thumper, who steals every scene he's in. It has a wonderful music score (the theme for Man later inspired John Williams for the shark's theme when he was writing the score for JAWS). BAMBI was followed by a direct-to-video sequel in 2006, which takes place after the death of Bambi's mother.

Even today, Bambi feels like a major risk. You've already established a reputation for high-quality fairy tale adaptations, so where does a calm, quiet, feature-length deliberation on everyday animal life fit in? They went for it anyway, no doubt conscious of Fantasia's then-recent commercial failure, and they pulled it off. In retrospect, both films are widely acknowledged as ambitious, timeless creative triumphs. So, the lesson is, don't worry about the now; just make work that makes you proud, and eventually society will catch on.Bambi is an obvious labor of love, from the careful document of reclusive forest wildlife to the gradual, almost cautious, plot development. It's sweeter than a sack of saccharine, a sugar rush of adorable young furballs with charming children's voices, singing songs and learning about the world, but also sober and profound. Of course, everyone remembers the crucial childhood's-end scene involving Bambi's mother, but his later, adolescent encounters with a rival buck and a roving gang of hunting dogs are equally powerful, with similarly harsh (but fair) lessons to teach us all.It may not be as flashy, nor as instantly gratifying, as the studio's biggest features, but I found Bambi a much more resonant, almost philosophical experience. It focuses on a community of big-eyed, impossibly cute talking animals, sure, but it's about so much more than easy feelings and simple superficiality."], ["Bambi (1942)", "Bambi is the last movie of Disney's golden age and one of the best of all the Disney movies.

Bambi should also further be acknowledged for its astounding audio and storytelling. The film was released in 1942 during the heart of the violent and historic event of ww2. During this time in history violence and the war was at the forefront of the world stage, with many people unsure if they would see their loved ones returned home. The view of man during this time was unruly and overall violent. In the film, this moment in history is portrayed through the lens of the many characters and expresses how the animal kingdom portrays man. In the film, human hunters are the people carrying out violence. Halfway through the film Bambi's mother is shot by a hunter and strikes the viewer to the core in a rated G film. The movie shows Bambi's agony following his mother's death, something relatable for people with loved ones in ww2. At the time of Bambi's release, destruction was also a common theme. Ww2 was not just the obliteration of cities and towns, but a disregard for nature itself and how precious it truly is. Man can also see this today with humanity's panicked fight against climate change and its regret of how humans have treated nature. In the film, humans, referred to as man cause a wildfire that destroys Bambi's forest and all of the animal character's homes. \"Man\" is the antagonist to not just Bambi in the film, but nature itself. Artistically Bambi had incredible audio. The score can capture and captivate the audience the entire way through the film, from the happiest of scenes to the most suspenseful. Walt disney, of course, loves to incorporate singing in his films and Bambi is no exception. Bambi's 'love is a song' and other songs throughout the film have stuck with audiences for generations. Also, the sound effects were above and beyond. The film had the noises of every animal in the forest, the wind blowing and howling, plus the dismal sound of the hunters shooting their dreaded guns. Another amazing element of this film was its captivating storytelling. Walt Disney brought an incredible story that makes one feel invested in nature itself and see the world through the lens of mother nature. The film is a coming of age story, that follows Bambi, a young buck growing up in the forest and facing obstacles throughout his childhood that would build him into the prince of the forest. The main takeaway from the story of Bambi is the obstacles one faces on their way to maturity and how the good and the bad builds people into who they truly are today. The story of Bambi is something every person can relate to in some shape or form. This film shows the issues of what was striking the hearts, at the time, with the true violence of ww2. Bambi also references the destruction of so many places, including man's carefree decimation of nature, which can be seen not just in the 1940s, but in modern society today. Artistically the film doesn't just orchestrates superb audio score and sounds effects, but captivates the audience with its coming of age story."], ["Absolutely charming.", "Inspired by the story by Felix Salten, Walt Disney and his compatriots concocted this vivid, striking animated tale of life in the forest. A \"prince\", or fawn named Bambi, has just been born, and the film mirrors the chapters to its life much the same way that seasons naturally occur in the wilderness.Everything here works tremendously - while the filmmakers are careful to introduce \"dark\" story elements into the story, they're woven in with ease, and everything feels organic. Clearly, much thought went into the preparation of each and every scene, and one does get that sense that Disney & company tried to be sticklers for realism, and have things happen as they actually would in nature.The non-stop array of endearing animated characters contains an irresistible trio: the wide eyed fawn Bambi, his aggressive rabbit friend Thumper, and the non-threatening skunk Flower, who merely wants to often stop and smell the flora. But it's not just the main characters who leave an impact, as there are plenty of minor diverting characters along the way.It's interesting how the element of man is introduced into this meaty story. You never do see guys in action shots brandishing their weapons; you mostly just hear the gunshots, which are threatening entirely of themselves. It gets to the point that a terrified bird would rather face death and hear a gunshot then live through that horrible silence between gunshots.One could argue for the presentation being somewhat syrupy, but it's still certain to provoke the expected family audience reaction: you DO care about these characters, and the operatic singing really drives home that sense of love and devotion common to the critters of the forest.Eight out of 10."], ["Sentimental (maybe bit schmaltzy), but beautifully made and affecting", "The film follows Bambi's first year of life in the forest, from his initial awkward steps to the birth of his own fawns. Comical at times, tragic at others, the film is typical of the highly anthropomorphic vision of nature common in animated features. Bambi himself is not a particularly interesting or memorable character, so the real draw of the film is the sumptuous animation, especially the fabulous multi-plane images of the forest. Apparently animating the deer was challenging but the artists struck a good balance between realism and fantasy (Bambi's body is more deer-like than his face). The style of animation varies throughout the film (e.g. almost surreal in 'fight scene' between Bambi and Ronno, impressionistic in the meadow, etc,) but the imagery is beautiful throughout. The voices are fairly typical for a Disney film (although, unusually, the young animals were voiced by children) and fans will instantly recognise the voice of Flower the skunk (as an adult) as being Sterling Holloway, who voiced Winnie the Pooh in 1966's \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\". The film's score is good (although not in the same league as those in the studio's preceding animated features (Snow White, 1937; Pinocchio, 1940; Dumbo, 1941 (or Fantasia, 1940, which was not original music)). I found it amusing that when the young male animals met flirtatious females, they would go rigid with excitement, a gag usually assumed to be somewhat Freudian in the more adult Warner Brother's cartoons (as an example, \"Red Hot Riding Hood\" (1943) stands out). I enjoyed \"Bambi\" but admittedly I'm only a couple decades younger then the film and far removed from the target audience. I don't know what young eyes not tinged with nostalgia will make of this generally sweet and gentle tale of soft-spoken, polite, and cute forest animals.

I was expecting plenty from a film I hadn't seen for almost 13 years, but I did believe it would hold up. So what do I think?I have to admit that this film did confuse me a bit with its scripting choices, such as the utilization of \"twitterpated\" to describe undeniable infatuation. For some reason, it felt slightly mature for Disney to make that choice, although we already had Pleasure Island and drunken hallucinations in the 2 preceding films of what I would call the Nativity era of Disney (or, the first 5 years before their 7 years of packages). I liked the acting and did find some of the humor to work, but I noticed that some parts of the film, such as a few scenes with Thumper and/or his sisters, were a tad too mean-spirited. One of the biggest disappointments of this film was the death of Bambi's mother; while it is indeed an emotional scene, it abruptly cuts away to Let's Sing a Gay Little Spring Song. I can understand how Disney thought that perhaps audiences might not desire such melancholy in the middle of WWII, but it was really distracting and overall was not done well as a death scene. I do have to say one good thing about it, though, in that it was a mistake I found Disney improved significantly upon 39 years later. The animation is above and beyond the standards of the Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry-infused 1942, with particularly fluid animations for the fire and also the perfect balance in the scenery between colorful and subdued. It was a sight to look at. Aside from the main song being the improper way to respond to one of the more iconic death scenes in Disney movies, I did overall think the music was above passable.I am sure that children and their grandparents would appreciate this movie, although they'll probably take the death of Bambi's mother and how it is cut away much harder than I did. For the common viewer, it's overall worth your time for its animation, music, and humor. I'll say it is definitely the right kind of film to conclude an era of actual movies."], ["Love is a Song that Never Ends", "Ah Bambi, what can one say about this cute innocent tale of a little deer growing up in the woods and then having his mother die?.....well OK, we all know about that on first glance, but what we also remember about Bambi is the artistry. The way the movie depicts nature is just stunning, from the trees, to the ground, to the meadows, to the fields, to the grass, to the water, to just about everything else. It really creates a sense of beauteous wonder that you don't find too often in animation.Adding on to the gorgeous backgrounds and settings, the animation on the animals are phenomenal, and considering how hard animals are to animate (let alone draw), the movements are flawless and the designs look cute enough without being nauseating, fitting the movie's feel of cute sentimentality. But when the movie gets dark, so do the lighting and shadows, and it executes both incredibly well.Storywise, it's basically just about a deer growing up in the woods, and that's it. Simple enough, yet honestly, that's why the movie works. Sometimes just seeing someone live from childhood to adulthood in a setting is interesting and captivating enough for a viewing experience. We were all children once in our lives, and this movie captures childhood really well by showing how innocent life was before we had to grow up. But then the death of Bambi's mother came, which has scared many for life, but it also taught folks that we must cherish the things we love, because nothing lasts forever, and it's important to hold on to them even when they pass on.Overall, while the movie is mostly cutesy in the first half, Bambi still stands the test of time for its Luscious artistry, charming innocence, hauntingly soothing score, and its important lesson to be warned that not everything you love for last forever.

Bambi learns various valuable life lessons throughout the film ranging from the importance of friendship, romance and the saddest lesson: death.The characters of the film are so lovable and diverse from the naivety of Bambi as a youth into his maturity as a young buck, the free-spirited and loyal bunny rabbit Thumper, shy and cute Flower the skunk, pretty and soft- spoken Faline who Bambi falls in love as an adult, wise and gone-too-soon Mother who begins to teach Bambi what life will have in store, the also wise but crotchety Friend Owl who tells the three best friends about romance and finally the absentee yet brave Great Prince of the Forest who is Bambi's father and saves his son near the film's fiery end (the Great Prince also raised Bambi following Mother's death as seen in the midquel 'Bambi 2').Disney's animation is breathtaking from its hand painted characters to lavishly painted backgrounds and the innovated multi-plane camera developed by the Disney company that has been instrumental to other film mediums outside of animation. The animators developed the realistic characters by studying actual deer, rabbits and skunks among other creatures lending to believable woodland critters rather than overly cartoony caricatures."], ["Stunning, Loving, Terrifying", "When we hear the word \"Bambi,\" we are quick to believe that we are referring to a maudlin, sentimental portrayal of a cute little deer. That the portrayal of the animals in the forest is saccharine and precious. What is really hear is a setup whereby we gain sympathy for the everyday battles that these creatures face. The starvation, the harsh winters, the forest fires, and so on. Bambi is a child at first and innocent and is heir to his father's portrayal as the patriarch of the woods. We are also reminded that the randomness of nature and the potential violence are small compared to the planned violence of the human animal. When man is in the forest, the animals are hunted specifically, their lives having no more meaning than that of a trophy. This is a truly remarkable film and a masterpiece of animation.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Animate Disney coming of age film", "This is a well developed story about a cute Disney animal. How he experienced love, friendship, relationship with the opposite sex and the struggle and turmoil he has to face and overcome. I read a reviewer complain about how this movie doesn't stay entirely true to animal life. However I personally think that isn't a big deal for a movie such as this. I think the message and the direction when it comes to the story is what matters. Now if it's a animal documentary of some sort, then I could understand. I just don't see how anyone could complain about a deer having a friendship, with a rabbit and a skunk in a Disney animated movie. As a matter of fact, I thought the friendship between Bambi and Thumper was the epitome of cute in a Disney movie. I think it's still a bit exaggerated when it comes to the tear-jerking level. I was sad as a kid to see Bambi's mother get killed, but didn't really cry or nothing. Overall, this is a well developed story about becoming a man.

Bambi is a classic piece of Disney cinema, made in a period of excellent Disney films, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo and one of my childhood favourites, Pinocchio. The animation throughout is gorgeous, with detailed, watercolour backgrounds, wonderfully flowing and realistic looking animals and very inventive at times. The musical score blends with the actions on the screen and serves as a great example of how music enhance the visuals. Bambi is not a film that supply massive laughs but there are plenty of chuckles to be had from the physical humour and adults will get a chuckle from the actuate portrayal different types of children. There is also an early environment message about the damage men can cause because of their reckless behaviour and serves as a constant threat for the animals.

The animation of the main characters is delightful and while most of the backgrounds are static, they are largely well-rendered, although I'd have to say that the depiction of fire didn't seem, well, fiery enough. It all starts with the baby deer's birth and neatly competes a narrative circle by ending with the birth of the now-grown deer's own offspring. The story is episodic and takes in every aspect of a deer's life one is even vaguely aware of, like their difficulty learning to walk just after birth and how males lock antlers when fighting, although it was news to me that they seemed so revered amongst their fellow-creatures. The supporting characters are either sympathetic (Bambi's mother, the wise old owl) or fun - Bambi's friends Thumper and Flower. Dialogue is sparse but well-used, not weighing down the simple-to-follow story with too many words. Music, naturally plays an important part in the film, with effective use of background music and songs, especially the \"April Showers\" sequence. The plot doesn't shy away from making points about indiscriminate hunting by humans and more general conservation issues about protecting animals' natural habitat, without once showing a human. There's pathos too, none more so than when Bambi's mother is shot and killed by man. All in all, short as it is, this was a delightful feature to watch of a Sunday afternoon, just keep a dry handkerchief near by at the end."], ["Man was in the forest!", "Bambi both heartwarming and heartbreaking.Bambi starts off with a sleepy feel but gets going once all the forest animals spread word of the birth of the newborn prince. We see Bambi grow up with his childhood friends Thumper and Flower. One day Bambi's mother takes him into the thicket to meet more deer and she warns him not to jump right out because there might be danger; or in other words hunters. Bambi goes into the thicket and meets more deer friends along the way.At one point in the movie Bambi and his mother are starting to enjoy the first signs of spring. Unfortunately a hunter shows up and we see perhaps one of the most traumatic scenes in thematic history. Bambi's mother leads him to safety only to be shot. While we don't see it we know what happened and Bambi's father tells him that he can't be with his mother anymore. The scene after this is more jubilant and seems to quickly go over the sadness of the last part. Here we see animals start to fall in love during the spring season. Bambi has now become an adolescent deer and he meets up with his childhood companions. The Owl that lives with them in the forest warns them about spring infatuation. Flower, Thumper and Bambi all agree that it will never happen to them; or so they say.In the last few minutes of the movie a fire breaks out after some hunters carelessly leave it. Bambi has to leave and he barely escapes in time along with his father. At the end of the film Bambi has fathered two fawns with Faline and he sits proudly watching on the hill along with his father.Bambi has a fantastic music score along with sounds of crashing cymbals and slow violin music that build up during the climatic scenes when danger is near. All the songs are decent and don't border on anything that might make your head pound. Bambi is a great film. However there are some things that I don't like. The background animation was not the best and that may be in part due to the fact that the war was still going on during that time and the studio may have suffered some financial problems. Also I think that the hunting scenes get a little out of control and can be hard to watch for younger viewers."], ["One of my favorite all-time ever?", "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded film-goer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece of Bambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes, Bambi covers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, but Bambi is so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitter pated."], ["great classic Disney movie", "Bambi is my favourite Disney cartoon film it has the old Walt Disney magic and has great animation. It is a classic at the bit when Bambi and Thumper are learning to icescate (well mainly Bambi) nd they find flower hibernating. The twiterpated bit will always be a favourite Bambi bit off mine when they all fall in love even after owl has warned them. It does have its sad bits and when Bambi's mother dies it is such a tear jerker. I love the beautiful background that Bambi is set on with all the beautiful colours blending in to make the beautiful forest background.

The emotion in this film doesn't make it a sad or disheartening one, as many people over-exaggerate on this, but it shows the audience a view of life from different view.

The darker side provides a good balance to the more child-orientated scenes.The circle-of-life parable is well told.The animation is superb, even by 2014 standards.

Aside from the horrible music in this film, the lack of a real plot and characterization of characters stood out greatly in my mind.This film moves too fast not developing much of anything of giving you any reason to develop an attachment to the characters. People who rate this as being a ten probably just have never either read good literature, watched something with a truly engaging plot, or just like any piece of junk they come across.It's not all bad I suppose, just boring, bland, and not what it's all cracked up to be. I will give it a five though for not just being a cutesy film based on no fact. They didn't completely murder the film by making the deers live in nuclear families or some crap, but nevertheless this movie is not something that I consider to be a great classic although for 1942 I suppose the animation is good.

As he grows up, he faces a slew of adventures in the woods and intermingles with characters that will forever be memorable in movie cinema like Thumper and Flower.The animation is great, as usual. The song \"Love is a Song\" is rich and beautiful, sung by Donald Novis, and was nominated for an Oscar. The orchestral score was wonderful and breathtaking, suiting the innocence and carefreeness of the wild animals perfectly.There is really not much of a solid plot to the story, as the movie is basically about Bambi growing up in the forest, making friends, finding love and taking on the \"Prince of the Forest\" title. But, there is moral to the story about survival and the circle of life. The many animals characters, including Thumper the bunny and Flower, the skunk were memorable and adorable and they made the film that much more special.I do find the hunter scene disturbing and it put a damper in me for the rest of the movie. If you have young kids, I would show them other Disney films over this one, and then show this film to them later on in their age.

This is true but it's hard to say whether the story of Bambi is one only intended for children. It involves childlike characters and experiences yet the story arc as time continues tends to become more adult related and a slight bit one sided. It's not to say children shouldn't watch it; it's Disney. There just happens to be more to the life of the main character than just living in the forest. By the end of the movie, a message far deeper than its premise will leave a stain of a memory.The movie is basically a cycle of how the animals live in the forest and how they deal with the seasons and man itself. It's a satisfying cycle although clich\u00e9 none the less. For this specific time line, no age bracket is skipped. The stages of becoming a toddler, young adolescent and adult are all covered which gives each age group that views this, something to relate to. The segment of becoming an adult and finding romance is where it gets a bit one sided. This particular segment makes the female animals look like they manipulate and end up making the male animal putty in their hands. This doesn't happen in real life for animals or humans as easily as it's made out to be.There are two other things that might turn off viewers. Next is the music; Frank Churchill did an excellent job at the score but the choir in the background in most of the music may come off as obnoxious. It's good the way they were used to represent the weather, but it still may get on viewers' nerves. And then there are the dark elements to this film such as \"man\", Bambi's mother's death and the final chase scene. These can be quite intense and almost leaps over the line of the family friendly to adult animated feature genre. Especially the hunters, these faceless dangers are the ones who speak the message of how dangerous humans can be. If Disney didn't own the rights, one could assume an animal rights activists group produced this. That's how strong the writers to this movie wanted us to feel for these forest animals.But credit should be given where is needed. The animation is great for its time. It still has the classic Disney feature feel and still holds up great today. Also the characters are very amiable. The voices to every character are very soft, mellow and calm. There are only a few times when a voice is elevated to excitement or terror. The child voice- actors that portray young Bambi, Thumper and Flower have the most adorable voices. The best voice of the rest of the cast is Bambi's mother's voice. That voice has the most gentle sound one could ever hear. Overall it's a decent Disney film; it just needs to be shown to a mature audience.The story of Bambi is cute along with his friends Thumper and Flower, and the music is done well too.

You've already established a reputation for high-quality fairy tale adaptations, so where does a calm, quiet, feature-length deliberation on everyday animal life fit in? They went for it anyway, no doubt conscious of Fantasia's then-recent commercial failure, and they pulled it off. In retrospect, both films are widely acknowledged as ambitious, timeless creative triumphs. So, the lesson is, don't worry about the now; just make work that makes you proud, and eventually society will catch on. Bambi is an obvious labor of love, from the careful document of reclusive forest wildlife to the gradual, almost cautious, plot development. It's sweeter than a sack of saccharine, a sugar rush of adorable young furballs with charming children's voices, singing songs and learning about the world, but also sober and profound. Of course, everyone remembers the crucial childhood's-end scene involving Bambi's mother, but his later, adolescent encounters with a rival buck and a roving gang of hunting dogs are equally powerful, with similarly harsh (but fair) lessons to teach us all. It may not be as flashy, nor as instantly gratifying, as the studio's biggest features, but I found Bambi a much more resonant, almost philosophical experience.

You see, I had a recently made a list of essential movies that I had to see by my 23rd birthday. Bambi was the first movie in the Animated Movies section of my list. I guess the reason I felt stupid for checking out the movie is that it is a movie about a mostly happy little deer and all of his mostly happy little forest animal friends. But after watching it, I think it is safe to say that it was probably one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen.One of the reasons I say this is because the animation is just so freakin' beautiful! Bambi's forest and all of its various locations are animated beautifully, with just the right amount of colors and a heck of a ton of spectacle. The forest is most beautiful when the movie is quite, which gives time for the beauty to sink in. And the most surprising part? The animation actually still holds up pretty well by today's standards- in a classic sort of way. The movie's cinematography is amazing too; basically every scene in Bambi oozes quiet deft beauty, especially during the April Showers sequence, in my opinion. The movie's soundtrack is also great, the song numbers sound good and also really fit their various scenes, when Bambi was just born, happy music plays and when Bambi's mom is shot by a hunter, sad music plays. The songs are also beautifully composed, not to mention. Bambi's plot is very simple, but unfolds beautifully as you watch all of the triumphs and tragedies that occur during the life of a normal deer who lives in a forest.I also liked how this movie uses visuals to tell it's story and not a lot of dialogue, something this movie doesn't have a lot of. I can also probably guarantee that if you watch this movie, you will freakin' fall in love with this movie's characters and this movie will also probably make you feel all types of emotions like joy and sadness and many others too. The movie's messages about compassion, empathy, life, and not hunting are also very poignant as well. And last but not least, Bambi's short running time allows it to not cram in too many events- which makes it all the more enjoyable to watch.And while I was watching this truly extraordinary film, I realized something. I realized that the reason I probably was liking this movie so much was because it was different from all of Walt Disney's movies at the time. There was no princess, emphasis on true love, king, queen, prince, or dragon. It was just a sort of short movie about the life of a normal deer in a forest and all of the sorrow and beauty in it.

None. No invention, no plot line, no credible sequence of action, just a series of unrelated vignettes pulled in long strings out the [*ahem*] and slapped wetly together to form a messy, soggy pile of melodrama so sappy that it reeks.

Since its release, Bambi has achieved what could be described as 'cult' status. It remains popular with young generations (obviously including children) and, strangely and apparently, forced Paul McCartney to switched to vegetarian meals. However, this does not make Bambi any better than Dumbo, Fantasia or Pinocchio. Bambi is famous for the classic but phony tear-jerking scene involving the title character, one of his relatives and hunters. Apparently, this scene made some viewers cry. But not everybody who saw that scene did. There is simply no evidence why it is that tear-jerking. But deep down, Bambi's plot is very basic and very understood by children and nature lovers and the funky song Little April Shower is enjoyable to sing along to.3 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["*sniff sniff*", "I am not ashamed too admit but this is one of the few movies I actually cried at.

Yes, obviously, because it is aimed at a (very) young demographic, I get it. But nothing happened. I mean, literally nothing - not until the final few minutes at least. What is Bambi's claim to fame?

The young deer is of course the eponymous Bambi and over the course of the film he learns about life in the forest from his mother and his new friend; a rabbit named Thumper. He learns about the other forest creatures and sees the changing of the seasons. He also learns that there are dangers; this is brought home in what is one of film's most famous deaths when is mother is slain by an unseen hunter. He manages to survive and eventually finds love with Faline and after the pair survive another run-in with hunters they have children of their own.This film is best known for the scene where Bambi's mother is killed and knowing about it in advance does take away from what should be a shocking and tragic moment. Bambi is shown to get over this event fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too upsetting for younger viewers.There isn't really a plot to speak of; we merely observe Bambi's various experiences. Likewise there is no antagonist which is unusual for a Disney film; the hunters remain an unseen threat and their hounds are only seen in one scene\u0085 although there is a real sense of threat in that scene and the dogs look genuinely menacing. As one would expect from Disney the film looks great with likable character designs and good animation. The music was a bit too twee for my tastes however that is probably just a product of the times. There are plenty of laughs to be had along the way; Bambi's attempts to walk on a frozen pond was both funny and cute. At only seventy minutes long it is unlikely that anybody will get bored in fact I suspect most people will be surprised when it ends so soon."], ["Trauma for Children, Nostalgia for Adults", "As usual the things that work are up first. Now we all know the scene that makes every little child cry, the death of Bambi's mom. This was a very daring moment for Disney killing a main character like this, it doesn't even happen on screen but it messed all of us up inside. Next, the animation looks great. It gets the movements of the animals down quite well and it is also very beautiful with the painted scenery. Another thing I noticed is that the score matches the animation perfectly. Every instrument is played at the right moment and it's a very lovely movie to listen to, it even was nominated for an Oscar for Best Scoring Of A Dramatic Or Comedy Picture. Friend Owl just cracks me up every time and is just utterly hilarious. Also I enjoyed how big the story got in the end. I know everyone remembers the cutesy beginning, but after Bambi returns as an adult it becomes almost like an animated epic. The colours, the music, it just becomes so much better. Now the things that didn't work for me. The beginning, I just don't enjoy it. All the cutesy stuff is too much and really drags on for me. The animation is still fairly good, but I just can't enjoy the characters as much. But it does has its moments, like when Bambi's mom first enters the meadow, the suspense just builds to an incredible amount and the animation on her copies a deer's movements down to the bone. All in all the beginning has its moments that tie it together well enough, but it's the second half that makes the movie. I loved it as a kid and I still love it now, it is near perfect."], ["A great, timeless Film", "Bambi came out in 1942, yet if I didn't know that, I might say that it came out some time in the eighties. The animation is absolutely beautiful, the plot is a simple coming of age story, and all the songs and jokes are timeless.The characters are all extremely likable. And then of course there is that one scene that everyone remembers when Bambi's mother is shot. What I like is that we don't see much, we don't see the mom's corpse, no blood, or the hunter's face.Bambi is not my favorite Disney animated movie, but it is one of my favorites. The characters are great, the story is timeless, the jokes are funny, the drama scenes are actually dramatic, and the animation is absolutely beautiful."], ["\"The Circle of Life\"...50 years before \"Lion King\"....", "I especially love this period of animation, although it is obvious that in this, the fourth feature length offering from Disney, that things were in a constant state of flux ( did I say that??)in the world of animation. I never saw Bambi or many of the other Disney offerings as a child in their full form because it simply was not mainstream. On the TV show, excerpts were the best Disney could do, the obvious reason being time constraints. So...I find myself catching up with lots of things that I missed coming up. Some are worth the effort...some not. I do not find myself especially crazy about Disney works and features...largely because Disney hired other folks to do the work and simply put his name on it. It's been tough to do a mental end-run around that, and I have been inclined to focus more upon the guys who actually did the work. But I guess a cerebral compromise is that, possibly with the exception of Ub Iwerks, many of these great animators and artists might not have gotten any exposure had it not been for Disney, and he did generously name the responsible artists...and, more than a few have gone on to make their mark in the animation world, though none..or very few...made a mark as profound as Disney's, since it was his idea to produce the first feature length animation. With that cathartic overture out of the way, I can now get to the heart of the matter. Bambi is one of the few Disney efforts that fall just shy of being something of an \"art-house\" film. Multi-plane camera technique was nothing new at this point...the Fleischers had used it throughout the 30s to great effect in their short subjects...but what differentiates Bambi from the Fleischer efforts is the detailed realism, and the attention to detail for movements and backgrounds. And , of course, there is the heart-rendering character, Bambi, born into the wilderness as a \"Prince\". The fact that his father is the \"Great Prince\" is largely under-played, but we discover this about Bambi after his mother is shot and killed by \"man\", the enemy of the wilderness and of its inhabitants. The \"Great Prince\" takes his \"son\" under his wing and sees him through to his adult \"manhood\". Bambi's life is predictable, and he meets his challenges with great fortitude, especially in his quest for a mate in the form of the female fawn ( now adult deer) Faline. His battle for her is successful, though Bambi has to reach inside of himself to gather strength and determination to vanquish his opposition. In many ways, the story of Bambi is a prequel to \"The Lion King\", which would come over half-a-century later. The progeny of animal royalty is born, is nurtured, and--at the appropriate time, he takes his proper place among the inhabitants. The main difference in the two stories is, of course, that in \"Lion King\", the rightful heir to the place of high respect is denied the main character, by quirks of fate. Once the main character realizes who he is and what his proper inheritance is, it then becomes a matter of fighting it out in order to settle it. Bambi ends in a similar fashion to \"Lion King\" in that Bambi is now well on his way to attaining the status of the \"Great Prince\", and has produced progeny of his own to carry on after he is gone. It is a life story...and, despite technical advances in animation--and in life--the story of life remains the same. We are born, we do what we are put here to do...and then we pass on. Bambi is well worth the watch, not just because of the evolving animation techniques, but it is a story of life, true to form, and told from the viewpoint of the inhabitants of the forest."], ["More animation", "The reviewer (Spleen) was wrong when he said that Disney did not make another full-length animated feature until 1950. Well, he's wrong! Disney came out with \"Saludos Amigos\" (1942, though barely a feature at 40 minutes); \"The Three Caballeros\" (1944) and \"Make Mine Music\" (1946). These were all original films, with Caballeros being the wildest animated film I believe Disney ever did! \"Bambi\" is indeed a classic, although the DVD I have promised \"All-New Disney Enhanced Home Theatre Mix\".

So Bambiis born in the spring in the thicket with his mother and all forest animals onlooking, and in the summer he learns to walk and talk with the help of his friend Thumper the rabbit and a skunk he call Flower, and he sees the meadow where he meets Faline the young female deer. In the autumn Bambi and mother experience a rainfall, then the winter sets in for a snowfall where Bambi and Thumper skate on the pond, and then tragedy occurs when you hear his mother shot by Man. Years later, Bambi, Thumper and Flower have grown up, and Friend Owl warns them that they could become \"twitterpated\", i.e. fall in love without warning, and that is exactly what happens, Bambi is reunited with also grown up Faline. There is a rivalry between Bambi and other male buck Ronno, but in a rutting match Bambi defeats him and he and Faline become a couple, and they continue their flirting and dancing in the woods. Danger sets in however when Man causes a forest fire, Bambi and his father help Faline escape attack dogs, and then they flee the fire over waterfall and onto a small island.

The picture quality is poor but it is better than not having any recollection at all. The narration is pure Disney and its all about the research that went into the main feature. Of course its testimony to history that seen through the eyes of middle upper class Americans its not really as accurate as Walt thought it was. Some of the facts are not facts at all. They call one creature a rabbit in the documentary but its certainly not a rabbit. It is a capybara. In the cartoon they even have an ostrich in South America!!

This tour is discussed at length in the documentary \"Walt & el Groupo\" and \"Saludos Amigos\" is a special feature included on this disk--though it was originally released in theaters in 1942.I know some will be shocked when they read this, but the fact is that the two feature films created as a result of this trip were pretty poor--mostly because they came off more like travelogues than the typical Disney film. IN addition, they simply are not fun and kids will hate them. Of the two, \"Saludos Amigos\" is the best--but it still is sub-par Disney. It consists of several shorts all released together instead of separately. Apparently Disney realized that the shorts had very limited marketability, so he had them bundled together and released. Imagine how sad people must have felt when they saw this dull stuff!The first short involves Donald Duck in Peru. While it has a few moments, it comes off as a dull travel film and not much more. Then, the film switches to an odd and not particularly entertaining film about a tiny plane called Pedro. This really seemed to have little to do with Chile. Then, footage of Walt and his employees visiting the Argentine gauchos is shown--followed by a short featuring Goofy as one of these cowboys. It's a lot like the typical Goofy educational film and shows the differences between the American and Argentinian versions. This is probably the best short of the four in the film but once again, it's far from their best work. Finally, the film jumps to Rio where there is a lot of samba music and lots of footage of Carnival and the short \"Watercolor of Brazil\". The music is the same title music to the Terry Gilliam film \"Brazil\"--a film about as different from this Disney film as you could imagine. This short features Donald Duck and a new character, Joe Carioca--a talking parrot. Mostly you just see them dancing about to samba music and they don't have a lot of personality...or fun.Overall, a pretty dull lot but made a bit better if you see the accompanying documentary.

There will be spoilers ahead:Prior to US entry into World War II, the US Department of State got Disney to go on a goodwill tour of South America due to the popularity of Disney's characters in Latin America.Material gathered there was used to make this film, which proved to be sufficiently popular that Disney made a second film (The Three Caballeros) in the same vein.At just over 41 minutes in length, this is just barely of feature length. Composed of live action footage and animation, it covers visits to the four countries of Peru, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Each section of the film describes what the Disney artists found in each country as inspiration, followed by short animated sequences based on the visits. Brief live action/animated transitions of flights are used to lead into the sections.The first animated segment, \"Lake Titicaca\", shows Donald Duck visiting Peru as a tourist and interacting with a boy and his llama. It's typical Donald Duck and is rather funny. The highlight is Donald and the llama crossing a suspension bridge.The second segment, \"Pedro\", concerns a little plane named Pedro and his flight to carry the mail over the mountains in Chile. It's a fairly standard short of the \"small hero faces adversity and wins through\" variety and is the weakest segment, mostly because the other three are more entertaining. It's still fairly solid.The third segment is Argentina and its gauchos. The live action footage of gauchos leads into a Goofy short, \"El Gaucho Goofy\" and it follows the pattern of other Goofy shorts. The best part here is the slow motion footage of Goofy in action at the tail end of the short.The fourth and by far the best animated segment is \"Aquarela do Brasil\" (\"Watercolor of Brazil\") which is the most lushly beautiful animation of the film. Donald makes his return in this and it also introduces Jose Carioca. The animation starts out as a series of watercolor drawings which become animated and things morph from one thing to another. The animation is fantastic and the music is marvelous. Donald meets Jose, who is awed at meeting \"Pato Donald\" and takes Donald out to see the sights and to dance the samba.

This, to me, is a better film than the Three Caballeros which followed it and which more people know about than this.There are really only only four shorts, Donald a tourist, Goofy as a gaucho, Pedro the mail plane, and a piece set to the song Brazil that introduces Joe Carioca.The real problem with this film is it just stops.

Released through RKO Radio Pictures. U.S. release: 19 February 1943. New York opening at the Globe: 12 February 1943. Sydney release at the Embassy (as a support to Victory Through Air Power): 10 February 1944. 4 reels. 43 minutes.SYNOPSIS: Walt Disney and his artists tour South America, finding inspiration for four new cartoons.NOTES: Plumb, Smith and Wolcott were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture (won by Ray Heindorf for This Is The Army). The title song was nominated for Best Song (won by \"You'll Never Know\" from Hello, Frisco, Hello). C.O. Slyfield was nominated for Best Sound Recording (won by Stephen Dunn for This Land Is Mine).COMMENT: Although the credit titles are at pains to point out that the travelogue portion of Saludos Amigos has been blown up from a 16 mm original, the photographic quality in the print under review (aside from a little jerkiness and under\u00acexposure) is excellent. The film is top-class too, with just enough background to introduce, separate and give added point and detail to the four cartoons. These four cartoons are each so richly detailed in characters and backgrounds, their humor is so wittily inventive and their craftsmanship so consistently stylish and imaginative, they must rank amongst Disney's finest achievements in the short-subject medium.Adding to the enjoyment of their individual styles, the first three cartoons do have one amusing feature in common - a clever commentary (expertly delivered by Fred Shields) which often gently sends up or is mockingly at odds with what we actually see on the screen. The visual throwaway gags are sometimes so fast (like the diaper flying over Pedro's hangar) the films need to be seen more than twice to appreciate them all. (Leonard Maltin has provided a full account of these many delightful touches in The Disney Films, Crown Publishers, New York, 1973.)The last cartoon, \"Watercolor of Brazil\", is the most visually original, providing a foretaste of the stunningly surreal style used more extensively in Disney's follow-up feature The Three Caballeros.Although most enthusiastically received by critics and picturegoers on its initial release, Saludos Amigos has never been theatrically reissued in its original form. The four cartoons were somewhat sloppily scissored into separate short subjects and reissued in 1955 when Disney's output of regular cartoons started to run down. Fortunately, the complete film is still available.Musically, Saludos Amigos is also a treat, with Donald tumbling through the Samba and jigging a llama with a Peruvian whistle, Goofy and his trusty steed hoofing a vigorous Dance of the Farmer's Daughter. The title tune is catchy enough, but heard only so briefly one wonders why it was nominated for Best Song in preference to the wonderfully emotive \"Brazil\"?"], ["What a Mix of Politics, Private Industry, Animation and Live Action", "ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT of this animation/live action hybrid was less spectacular than Disney's other efforts, such as SNOW WHITE, FANTASIA, BAMBI and DUMBO; it certainly was a success. Both at the Box Office and in critical praise, SALUDOS ANIGOS was adjudged a winner; both domestically and in the overseas marketplaces.SUCCESS IN THE third area of its reasons for existence were even more overwhelmingly effective than had been anticipated by anyone. The behind the scenes genesis of the film was an alliance between Disney and the United States Department of State. Presents us with a most perfect example of collaboration between the Private Sector and the Public in the form of the U.S. Federal Government, Roosevelt Administration.UNLIKE MOST SUCH experimentations, this one worked and paid big dividends for both parties.IN MMAKING SHORT work of a long story, the State Department underwrote a good will tour by Walt and a group of his artists, musicians and writers. The tour was of South America with stops in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile and some others. The purpose was two fold. One being as a sort of bulwark against the growing fascination with Fascism on the Conytinent; with the other's being an extended junket by the Disney Company in discovering the customs, manner of dress, language, literature and music of the many countries and regions of South America. Both ends were highly successful.THE SCENARIO FOLLOWS the real life tour of the Disney crew and uses the tour by airplane as the link between four animated segments. The first finds American tourist, Donald Duck, replete with faithful camera, visiting the Bolivia-Peru border at Lake Titicaca. The second finds a story very much like LITTLE TOOT (the tugboat); but has at its center a family of anthropomorphic airplanes whose job is to fly the mail over the Andes Mountains. The third examines how the Argentine Gaucho is the South American equivalent of the Cowboy of the Old West. Segment four brings Donald Duck to Rio de Janero in Brazil; where he meets and interacts with Portuguese speaking Parrot, Jose Carioca.ONE FURTHER OBSERVATION which we found was regarding the format that they used in framing the individual story segments. As a central dramatic device, Disney chose that of the touring artisans being moved about the continent from one country to another their charter airliner; much in the same manner that the real tour did.THE FICTIONAL MOVIE flight reminded us of our 4th grade geography book. In it one character \"Peter Martin\" was privy to his father's trans-global flight in which the two (along with us 9 year olds) visited all of the continents save for Antarctica.THE GREAT STORY of behind the scenes story of SALUDOS AMIGOS and its sequel, THE THREE CABALEROS, is told in the 2008 documentary film, WALT & EL GRUPO."], ["Disney's strangest adventure.", "'Saludos Amigos (1942)' is clearly Disney's weirdest 'classic', acting as a live-action travelogue with an anthology of animated shorts peppered throughout.

That's perhaps why this piece has aged more than its peers. The actual animated shorts aren't particularly bad, but they don't exactly grip you, either. Still, they're a decent amount of fun in their own right. The best is probably the musical finale, which introduces Jos\u00e9 Carioca - essentially the Brazillian Donald Duck - and features some inventive 'real-time painting' visuals. As a whole, the movie is rather uninspiring. It's odd and poorly paced, sticking out like a sore thumb in the studio's catalogue.

Basically, this Disney work is a collection of four cartoons, each under 10 minutes. Between these cartoons, we find out some information about life in South America at that point. I did not like the introduction about cartoonists traveling down south, but the other sequences between the cartoons very informative and certainly worth a watch already for the contemporary historical documents they are.The four cartoons were all created by different directors and also work as stand-alone films. The first is about Donald experiencing South American in his usual slapstick fashion. We see his struggles with a llama and with dizzy heights. The second is about little mail plane who suddenly gets called to action after his parents suffer from high oil pressure. I found the ending a bit too melodramatic, but everything else about this short film is very good, possibly my favorite from the quartet. The third is another how-to short film featuring Goofy about how Argentinians/Gauchos live. I like especially the sports-related Goofy shorts, but this one did not do too much for me. Finally, Donald is back and meets a Brazilian bird. A fruitful collaboration as these two caballeros join two years later for \"The Three Caballeros\" with another bird not seen yet in this short film. Also, I would like to emphasize one scene, where a bee gets swallowed by a carnivorous plant, then transforms into Donald and spits out the bee again. This example that the bee is not just gone shows how family-friendly these cartoons were and really neglected the presence of death completely unlike animated films these days.\"Saludos Amigos\" scored three Oscar-nominations in the music/sound categories, which is fairly uncommon for a short film looking at today's standards. It did not win an Oscar, but its success was probably one of the main reasons for the sequel. Worth a watch for cartoon enthusiasts or people interested in the history of South America. Lots of Latin music included here as well."], ["Looks more like a documentary.", "This is Walt Disney's sixth full length animated feature film. If you're looking for an animated movie based on a fairy tale or a conventional Disney story about talking animals, you will not find it here. This film is one of six package films (string of short stories bundled in one movie) which contains four features based on the culture of South America. Apparently, Disney started making package films due to the cut in number of Disney staff members because of World War II.This film looks more like a documentary than a classic Disney movie or cartoon short. It consists of both animation, which wasn't bad for its time, and live action scenes that includes Walt Disney and animators touring South American countries to learn about their cultures. Each live action scene serves as a lead-on to the animated short stories, which unfortunately aren't very captivating due to the lack of character personality, fun, comedy and charm. While unique, the film is not an attention grabber and children certainly wouldn't be able to sit through it. With the exception of Donald Duck and Goofy, much of the cartoon characters are forgettable.Again, it is a unique Disney film entry, but falls short of entertainment. It won't hurt to skip over this one.

That's right, no look at the legacies of colonialism (namely the terrible inequality). Cool parrot Jos\u00e9 Carioca (which is the demonym for Rio de Janeiro) of course returned in \"The Three Caballeros\".Basically, this movie is what Disney THOUGHT that it meant to build good relations with Latin America. A better way to do so would be to read Eduardo Galeano's \"Open Veins of Latin America\" (a Spanish-language copy of which Hugo Ch\u00e1vez gave to Barack Obama at a Summit of the Americas in 2009).1 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Saludos Amigos", "I'm not sure whether to call \"Saludos Amigos\" a film, a short, an educational piece or an experiment. It is, at the very least, an interesting endeavor. The snippets of information given in the segments are interesting, and it's nice to get a bit of culture. The aged, sepia tone video footage of the Central American areas visited (and South American) gives it a rustic feel, which makes me want to visit. Yes, this Disney cartoon made me wonder what it is like to live in Brazil, Argentina and so forth. That's impressive enough on its own.\"Saludos Amigos\" isn't as such a whole story, but four segments. In all honesty, they don't seem like much to make up a movie, and while the first three are cute and well animated, they seem more like the Disney shorts for television. The style doesn't seem cinematically distinct, like the Golden or Dark Age of Disney. It's lovely to look at and masterfully done; the movements and comedic timing are sublime, and the backgrounds are gorgeous. It just seems a tad less special than Disney's other works.That is, until the last segment. Set in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, it is called Aquarela do Brasil (Watercolour of Brasil). It's beautiful, artistic and inspired. The music is wonderful, and it showcases the animator's talent and imagination. It seems like the whole movie was interesting tidbits, leading up to a really cool piece of animation. The flamingos, waterfall and toucan-bananas were really cool! Not only that, but now I know where that green parrot originated from. Jos\u00e9 Carioca, needs to be brought back. He's suave, has a sexy accent, and smokes cigars. I demand more Jos\u00e9! Also, seeing Donald getting drunk and nabbing some booty is rather hilarious.The segments include Donald and Goofy in all sorts of situations; Donald rides a grumpy llama at Lake Titicata, Goofy takes on the persona of an Argentinian gaucho. There's a sweet little short involving a plane named Pedro, who must deliver mail in Santiago. There is a few funny moments, such as when Donald and his llama get stuck on a bridge, or when he breaks the fourth wall in the fourth segment by using ink from Jos\u00e9's outline to draw a silly stick figure. The educational aspects were pleasant, you can tell the animators had fun. It was neat to see Uncle Walt! Overall, \"Saludos Amigos\" is a passable little feature. It sports some decent and amazing animation, and introduces a cool character. It was genuinely interesting. I'm not sure if the information is outdated, but it show cultures of days gone by, and that is worth a lot. It's nothing amazing, but it's cute, you can see the effort put into it. It deserves to be checked out at least once."], ["War times were tough, even for animation studios", "Saludos Amigos is basically Disney's desperate wartime attempt to find new markets and to make some quick cash, because understandably European markets had something else on their minds at the time. And it shows. Saludos Amigos is straight pandering to South American public and at least it earns some points for honesty and for at least trying to be entertaining.Nevertheless, it's pretty clear that this was made in some rush and with an extremely limited budget. All of the segments are brief, kind of rough and don't contain much of a story. All are also little more than tourist ads for various South American locations, which isn't as much of a problem as you would think, given that this was done by Disney, after all.The first and the third segment, featuring Donal Duck and Goofy, respectively, are the two better ones in my opinion. Both heavily resemble the various Disney shorts made before this and in a good way. They're quick with jokes, the two characters are as entertaining as they've always been and as a whole I have nothing major against them.The second segment, featuring Pedro, the littlest airplane, is the granddaddy of Pixar's whole Car franchise, and that's not a compliment. While the segment contains some of the nicest animation sequences in the whole film, and the various images are both threatening and cute, varying as the scenes demand, the main character is annoying, the story predictable and as a whole it's just painfully childish.The last segment, featuring Jos\u00e9 Carioca, is not my favourite, but it's a fun little story about one crazed parrot introducing Donald to samba and various other Brazilian traditions. From what I've understood, Jos\u00e9 is still a popular character in South America, and I can see why. He has a lot of personality, funny hijinks with his whole \"ladies love samba\" gigolo routine and he works very well with Donald. The whole segment is painfully advertising, but at least we got a good character out of it.Saludos Amigos is important part of Disney's legacy, because it was one of the films that allowed them to tide over the war years. It's not a very good film compared to Disney's usual fare, but I like that I've seen it."]], "The Three Caballeros": [["A Historical Note", "Most everything about this neat little movie has been said by previous posters, except this.The motivation for making it was, of all things, the US State Department! The US was deeply involved in fighting World War Two. At this point in time the average American knew almost NOTHING about South America, and the Nazi government was busy making business and political connections there, especially in Paraguay... there, transplanted Germans were a well established colony. They were aiding Hitler's war effort with the operation of industrial concerns, as well as providing espionage support.South America promised to become a new battlefront if German successes and infiltration continued. The region produced vital strategic raw materials, key among them rubber.Our strongest ally in the region was Brazil. The US Navy had a number of installations there, both sea and air. The Brazilian Navy worked closely with US forces in hunting U-boats in the Atlantic narrows; a number of US Navy vessels were transferred to them. American air bases (the largest of which was at Recife) provides home base for American aircraft, both fixed wing and lighter than air blimps, to provide air support coverage to trans Atlantic convoy operations.The State department felt it would be a good idea to familiarize Americans with the land, people, and way of life of South America, and called on Disney to produce THE THREE CABALLEROS. The movie was, first and foremost, a TEACHING TOOL for both military forces and the general public during a global war.BTW... I love the crazy little bird too! HE'S the best part of the film!There are two other Disney films made for the Government that I'd LOVE to find copies of.One is VICTORY THROUGH AIR POWER, another WW2 product.The other is one that I saw back in Basic Training in the 1970s. Believe it or not, the Walt Disney studios produced a military training film on the prevention of VENEREAL DISEASE!!!

All of them are performed with some fantastic art work and animation combining live action and cartoon characters.The last fifteen minutes seems to be scrambling for a way to keep the viewer's attention with some explosive fireworks and a dazzling display of surrealism, minus any conception of a way to end the movie on a high note. The film itself is uneven, offering typical Disney animation for the flying donkey sequence and then resorting to over-the-top fireworks that outdo the Pink Elephants number from DUMBO.But it's hard to resist the bouncy South American flavor of the score and the charming characterizations of Donald, Panchito and Jose Carioca. The stylized conception of a Mexican Christmas by artist Mary Blair is a standout among the art work involved here, although later the pi\u00f1ata sequence is a bit overwhelming in effects.The dazzling color and the music make it worth watching at least once, although it's hard to make a comparison between this and other Disney full-length features.

I think it was less successful than most Disney films because the subject matter -- like its near-twin Saludos Amigos, a cartoon tour of Latin America -- was and is less engaging for most people than fairy tales.I've traveled a bit in Latin America, and still find that this clever little film captures something sumptuous, wondrous and oddly truthful about those distant places, even if seen through a distinctly American lens. What's more, it's the most sensuous G-rate movie I've ever seen. Sambas, wild orchids, wow.I was four when it came out, and it immediately became my favorite movie. Indeed, I was obsessed. In the 40s and 50s, I kept up with movie-theater schedules for miles around just on the off-chance that this, and one or two other favorites, might be playing somewhere, usually at a Saturday matin\u00e9e within driving distance. Every few years, my vigilance paid off and I would bug my mother to chauffeur me miles from home to see my beloved Caballeros.When I had children, in the early days of VCRs, we bought all the Disneys as they were released.

The basic premise here is that Donald Duck is celebrating his birthday, and a large package of presents is sent to him from friends in several Latin American countries.  The event turns into a celebration of Latin culture, focusing on Brazil and Mexico; Donald is given tours by two \"colleagues,\" a cigar-chomping parrot-cum-boulevardier named Joe Carioca, and Panchito, a bandito rooster (complete with never-empty six-guns).Perhaps twenty to thirty minutes of the piece is made up of the cartoon characters superimposed over live action, or live actors doing carefully choreographed moves in front of a screen.  The techniques are apparent to the eye, and dated by modern standards, but they were reasonable attempts to fuse the two worlds together.  More problematical to this correspondent is the last 10-15 minutes; while having a few interesting sequences, the lack of a plot (becoming a dream of random images in Donald's ever-confused thoughts) makes the section drag down the rest of the film.  Less importantly, politically correct types may object to the \"Hollywoodization\" and \"Disneyfication\" of Latin culture/music that turns it into a progression of scenes from a folkloric or idealized mariachi show.  Of course, shows like \"The Three Caballeros were never meant to show the actual grit of much of Latin American life....If you're looking for that reality, avoid this like the plague.

There is also much to enjoy scenes wise, the title number is filled with energy, and You Belong to My Heart is lovely.

It belongs right up there with \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" A live figure may begin to dance and sing through a cartoon village. Soon Donald Duck joins the dance. Then the lamp posts begin to sway rhythmically, and soon the buildings are bouncing up and down, and then the moon darts from side to side.

Propaganda of the time was pretty heavy-handed, and most of it isn't all that entertaining today except as an artifact of the period. This movie is a joy to watch in its own right, and if there's an anti-fascist message embedded within, it's awfully subtle.My understanding was that this was Disney's attempt to open up Central and South America as a market for their films, since the war had pretty much eliminated the European market. Whatever its pedigree, though, this is one of the few Disney videos that I don't mind watching endlessly with the kids, especially the parts that involve the titular Caballeros.The movie is somewhat disjointed and episodic, but what holds it all together is good music. My least favorite episode is the story of the flying donkey, which gets old quickly, particularly since (and this is my one complaint) they chose to have a North American announcer attempt a Mexican accent. Why they could not have simply found an actual Mexican actor is beyond me - Los Angeles being in Mexico's backyard, after all. But Disney seemed to enjoy mixing and matching nationalities even into the 1960s, hiring, for example, US actors to play English characters in Mary Poppins, Treasure Island, and 101 Dalmatians; or Hayley Mills, who was a British actress who always seemed to be playing an American. In fact, the latter is something seen commonly nowadays, when it seems half the working actors in Hollywood are British subjects putting on American dialects (Hugh Laurie, Damian Lewis, Christian Bale)."], ["View it for what it is", "Funny, people nowadays don't seem to realize that this was a World War II propaganda film -- only one comment below makes that point.

Even more of the fractured, surreal nature of this film is explainable when viewed in the context of other Disney animated features of this time. \"Fantasia\" (of course), \"Dumbo,\" \"Pinocchio\" and other movies contained what seemed like drug- or alcohol-induced sequences (maybe someone with more intimate knowledge of Disney productions of the time can shed some light on those!). Disney also seemed eager to experiment with blending of animation and live action during this time (\"Song of the South\").

The lack of a strong plot and those opening segments (well, the penguin segment was alright, but really The Flying Burrito?)are more than made up in later segments, which takes the form of a travelogue through Bahia in Brazil and Mexico.First stop is Bahia with Jose where live action and animation combine o form a big pop sequence full of bright colors and rollicking samba music. Carmen Miranda's sister Aurora appears in live action singing Os Quidenes de Yaya (The Cookies of Yaya) followed by a surrealist trip through a dance hall full of brightly colored circles, musical instruments playing themselves, and roosters turning into dancers.The second part is a our tour through Mexico on the magical serape. Here Donald chases girls on the beach, dances in traditional Mexican dances and falls in love with a girl singing You Belong to My Heart in Mexico City's nightlife.

In \"Caballeros,\" the colours just pop, the characters leap off the screen. It's wonderful to look at, if not a tad exhausting. Much like \"Saludos Amigos,\" it tries to be an educational piece, telling American audiences little tidbits about their South American and Mexican neighbours. It was, as was its sister picture, an attempt at showing harmony between South and North America.There is not much in terms of plot. The framing device is Donald Duck opening some birthday presents, which transport him to different places in Central and South America. There are some short films, such as a little boy and his flying burro, a penguin who wants to live in the sun, and so on. These shorts are much more entertaining than those in \"Saludos Amigos.\" We also have the welcome return of Jos\u00e9 Carioca, the green parrot, who brings Donald to Bah\u00eda, where they lust after a live action woman (Aurora Miranda), who is selling cookies. There is also the introduction of our Mexican mascot, Panchito, a hyperactive rooster who dons a sombrero and carries a pair of pistols. He's as much fun as Jos\u00e9, if only crazier. Panchito tells a very interesting story about Las Posadas, a Mexican Christmas tradition, which implements the use of the pi\u00f1ata. Using a magic carpet, or sarape, Panchito flies Donald and Jos\u00e9 to various places in Mexico, such as Acapulco and P\u00e1tzcuaro, where they learn various Mexican dances, and where Donald tries to get it on with the ladies. You read that right, Donald tries to get some tail on a Mexican beach. I hope Daisy doesn't find out! This is a fun little film. The main trio are enjoyable and charismatic (more so Jos\u00e9 and Panchito), and the animation is bright and well crafted, and brilliantly timed. There is also some live action and cartoon mixing, which is not as impressive as later Disney ventures, but still impressive for this time. The ending gets a bit too heavy on the dancing and partying, and never slows down to take a breather. There is a lack of focus, but it seems that was the intention. Regardless, the animation is so nice, the characters so likable, and the music so catchy and fun, that it makes \"The Three Caballeros\" a unique, enjoyable experience, with plenty of culture and atmosphere."], ["From within Disney's Cabinet of Curiosities", "\"The Three Caballeros\" is one of the most unusual of oddities in the Disney animated canon. It's arguably the package feature which requires to be seen altogether the most (that is not to say that these such films deserve to go cut up and remain only viewed as separate short subjects and featurettes; it's just that they could and have easily been viewed as separate things). Regardless, it still doesn't have much of a plot. Donald Duck receives a whole load of birthday presents from his friends in Latin America, the first of which he opens being a film reel exhibiting short subjects concerning Latin American themes and stories. However, the film soon deviates as Donald's eccentric friends Jose Carioca (a parrot from Brazil) and Panchito (a rooster from Mexico) arrive and via the use of some magic gifts transport Donald to their respective countries, where live-action actors and animated settings and beings interact. In my opinion, the second and third acts of the film (the first act being the assorted short films) cannot really be viewed out of context, so in some ways, the film walks the line between single story feature (such as \"Snow White\", \"Pinocchio\", \"Dumbo\" etc) and package feature.For those who don't know much about the context in which the film was made (I suspect that most people who are visiting this page, however, are animation buffs who will know a bit about this film), \"The Three Caballeros\" was, like the earlier \"Saludos Amigos\" (a similarly unusual entry in Disney's library of animated features), a by-product of the American government pressuring Disney to create films based around Latin American themes in order for the USA to woo neutral South America during the Second World War away from anything Axis, and respectively also make Yankees appreciate all things South of the Border. There are hints to the propaganda purposes (such as the general \"OMG, aren't Mexico and Brazil so cool?\" tone as well as the birds of South America being dubbed \"Donald's cousins\"), but overall, the film doesn't seem too dated, or as much as everyone says it has.\"The Three Caballeros\" is actually rather surreal. I honestly believe that such a far-out film would never get made today by such a prominent studio. It's the trippiest of Disney's animated classics easily. \"Alice in Wonderland\", as everybody jokes, is a bit of an LSD-fest in places, but its storybook roots keep it from seeming like the result of drinking something from a bottle marked \"DRINK ME\". And the high-brow spirit of \"Fantasia\" and its Rackham-esquire look has always prevented me from labelling it as truly trippy. Much of \"The Three Caballeros\", however, is so crazy that I wondered if I'd taken something by accident. The main background throughout the film is vague, changing colour to suit the mood of the scene, and the animation has no limits most of the time (for example, inanimate objects and things come to life like random, the laws of physics are disobeyed very much so and characters morph and multiply at the drop of a hat). There's even some early experiments with mixing animation and live action thrown in. Some of it is kinda lame - Aurora Miranda, playing a Brazilian cake seller, looks like she's simply walking in front of a screen where footage of Donald Duck is playing - however, some effects are quite good, such as animated cockerels morphing into live men.Overall, \"The Three Caballeros\" is a good film. Admittedly, the first act doesn't match the second and third act very well (it actually seems like left-overs from the tamer sister-film \"Saludos Amigos\", and some of the surrealism gets a bit too baffling to watch (the final ten minutes or so is an example of this sort). And not knowing any Portuguese, Jose Carioca can be difficult to understand, as he often spurts out the odd word or phrase in his native language. Yet the film is most certainly still worth watching, and makes for quite an underrated piece. Also recommended is \"Blame it on the Samba\" from 1948's \"Melody Time\". Whilst generally quite a dull package film, that segment is excellent. I believe that it was planned for \"The Three Caballeros\", though didn't surface until a few years later."], ["Trippy, but Good!", "I bought this DVD because Donald Duck is my absolute favorite cartoon character.

Was he a little lonely during a separation from Daisy or something?!Nevertheless, the movie is still entertaining. I especially liked the animation shorts at the beginning. The title song is fantastic. The story just gets a little trippy and cooky near the end, but that sort of ambitious and unique story-telling is somewhat of a rarity nowadays.All in all, a solid good film.

There is some fine work in which the animated characters are incorporated into live-action musical sequences.

They weren't really films.  This one is just a collection of beads from the studio's Latin American years on a pretty string.  Some of the beads are short cartoons, not really any different from Disney's other short cartoons of the period - which is, although I don't need to say this, praise.  To be honest I find it hard to remember, without looking it up, exactly which South American Disney cartoons are featured in this movie and which aren't.The linking segments with Donald Duck are weird and - now and then - wonderful.  Disney seems to have tried every possible way of combining animation and live action (the live action is usually Carmen Miranda). Some of the attempts fall flat - many shots are obviously Miranda walking in front of a movie screen onto which Donald Duck is being projected; and the section featuring Donald Duck flying on a magic carpet over South American countryside is just a cheap and gruesome mis-match.  But other times it's dazzling.  The transformation of animated cacti into human dancers, or human dancers into animated roosters, are technical marvels which made me gasp. Perhaps if I saw them on the big screen I'd be able to work out how they were done - but they'd still be spectacular.  More so.In short, this certainly has its moments - some of the most anarchic moments Disney or any other studio had produced.  People who aren't fans of animation will probably find it unendurable.  (I don't blame them.  It's not really a film.)  People who are fans HAVE to see it."], ["A journey to Latin America", "The 7th animated Disney classic is clearly not one of Disney's best works. Nevertheless, it is one of their most different. I guess I can say that this movie has something to offer.This must have been the very first movie that combines live-action with animation... or at least one of the first movies to do so. This combination works out reasonably, but some movies are more successful in this \"marriage\": for example, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", \"Pete's Dragon\", \"Mary Poppins\" and the documentary \"Man, Monsters and Mysteries\". As much as this is true, it isn't any less true that this combination in \"The Three Caballeros\" works out clearly better than in \"Space Jam\", for example.Without being a super movie and despite the fact that this movie doesn't age as well as most Disney animated classics (\"Pinocchio\", \"Fantasia\", \"Bambi\", \"The Aristocats\", \"Robin Hood\", \"The Rescuers\", \"The Fox and the Hound\", \"The Little Mermaid\", among many others...), it is however a curious and peculiar little film.The most interesting thing about this movie is that it takes us through Latin America, mostly Brazil and Mexico.The story takes place on Donald Duck's birthday and he receives lots of presents: shorts about tropical Latin America, different kinds of birds, etc... and he's joined by Jos\u00e9 Carioca aka Z\u00e9 Carioca (the green parrot) and later by Panchito Pistoles (the pistol-packing red rooster). Jos\u00e9 Carioca represents Brazil and takes Donald Duck to Ba\u00eda, while Panchito represents Mexico and takes both Donald Duck and Z\u00e9 Carioca to Mexico.During its last 15 minutes more or less, the movie gets gradually less interesting, becoming somewhat empty and lame, with things that don't make much sense to me.By the way, this movie has some fabulous artwork. The \"three caballeros\" are very well designed (Donald Duck is very well drawn now) and the artwork of Latin America is spectacular. For example, Ba\u00eda is very beautifully drawn, with gorgeous sunset, life, great monuments and a romantic atmosphere at the sound of a beautiful song with the same name as the city/village.There's also some great voice actors: the inimitable Clarence Nash as Donald Duck, Jos\u00e9 Oliveira as Jos\u00e9 Carioca and Joaquin Garay as Panchito. Just for the record, Joaquin Garay is the father of Joaquin Garay III (Paco from \"Herbie Goes Bananas\")."], ["beautiful animation, silly plot, questionable themes; there have been better Disney films...", "In a technologically advanced cartoon with stunning visuals and beautiful groundbreaking color and animation, Disney took on role as an ambassador between the citizens of the United States and their strange, dark-skinned, maybe primitive but recently allied next-door-neighbor, Latin America. The year was 1945, and the rage was exoto-tourism.The idea was to introduce the United States to the color and excitement of Central and South America. To our main character Donald, the good old-fashioned patriotic American Duck, the worlds shown to him by his Latino bird buddies are far from familiar. Foreign music, seemingly tribal dancing, beautiful women and exotic landscapes overwhelm Donald, and he becomes infatuated. This unknown world holds the same appeal and excitement to Donald and it probably did to countless European explorers. In fact, the scenes depicting the bizarre customs, cultures and landscapes in the movie hold the same kind of colonizing curiosity of earlier times before and during Western exploration. It is human (and maybe even Anatidaean) instinct to be curious about the unknown.Unfortunately, it is also human instinct to make generalities. We find here a very large contradiction, perhaps even a paradox. While the cultures of Donald's friends, the Brazilian and the Mexican, are about as similar as a parrot is to a rooster, the film portrays them as almost identical. In Brazil we find a beautiful town full of beautiful people with dark hair and darker eyes, singing dancing and having quite a time. In Mexico, it's about the same, but maybe with more of a vaquero-esquire vibe. It seems The Three Caballeros de-racializes Latin America and disregards Brazil's African roots as well as Mexico's numerous indigenous roots, kneading and forming them into one homogeneous brown-skinned singing and dancing culture.So now we know they're friendly. It's okay, we can go for a trip to Acapulco and sunbathe with some beautifully bronzed female Mexican centuplets. We'll drink, we'll dance, we'll embrace and kiss and be merry, however not ever with another male. The film quickly shows that while Latin American men can have a gay time, they certainly aren't gay gay, The rooster (or was it the parrot?) adamantly make this clear by rejecting Donald's kiss. But don't worry; Donald thought he was a girl. Americans sure as hell aren't gay, either.Well I feel guilty now for bringing all of this up. I'm sure Disney had the best intentions in introducing the U.S. to the neighbors below. A cartoon-documentary marking the full history of every diverse Latin American country using cell animation in 1945 would take longer to create than the pyramids did. And who knows if it would have held an audience's attention? The point is that despite these intolerant tendencies in The Three Caballeros, whether intentional or due to naivety, the brief exploration of the Latin American unknown in this visually stunning film may have been a pretty decent introduction for a 1945 United States audience."], ["Ay Carumba, What a Beautiful Mess", "In the 1940s, Walt Disney's company was hitting a massive financial slump when their movies, besides Dumbo, were failing at the box office and the WWII army occupied the studio. So until Cinderella came around, they only ended up making second rate package films. One of them, being The Three Caballeros, is often cited as one of the better anthology flicks based on public perception and nostalgia, but I have to admit, I found this movie to be too overwhelming in a bad way. I admire it for all the technical wonder that was put into it, but this flick is a jumbled mess.Now even though this feature does have a plethora of segments shown throughout, it does actually have somewhat of a narrative. The essential bare bones plot revolves around Donald Duck receiving three individual presents on his birthday. One of them is a projector showcasing several different shorts on birds and winged animals, the other is Jose Carioca showcasing Donald all the wonders of Brazil and Bahia, and the last one is the Mexican rooster Panchito Pistoles showcasing all the wonders of Mexico and a crazy pi\u00f1ata. However, even though these segments are admirable in their own regard, the best way to describe the whole structure of the feature is like being at a party; it's fun at first but then it gets exhausting after some time. The segments in the first act are enjoyable enough on their own, and the musical moments are really fun to watch. Unfortunately, a good chunk of the 2nd act is just dancing and partying without much really going on and the third segment is just Donald trying to get with a beautiful lady....riveting.Ironically, the movie tries so hard to cram in as much entertainment value as it can that it ends up becoming an absolute chore to sit through. I will admit that plenty of the segments are fun, but there's so much going on that I find it hard to watch a whole 72 minute long feature consisting of them. Maybe if they were just individual shorts released before other films they would have been more tolerable, but cramming all of them into a movie just makes my head hurt. It doesn't help that when you get down to it, there isn't much of a proper story. All the film does is present three gifts filled with partying and Latino magic and....that's it. I'm not saying every movie needs a traditionally structured plot, but there is little to no momentum in this film at all. Maybe if it ended with Donald's gifts burning or Donald waking up from a dream I would have felt some something, but otherwise I feel as if this film forgot whatever it was supposed to be in the long run.In terms of the animation itself, there is certainly a lot of passion shown on screen. The lighting and effects are glorious, the character animation is very cartoony and loose, and even the production design is worth analyzing. As chaotic as the film is, at least the animators knew how to have fun with themselves. In addition, this is one of the first Disney films to mix live-action with animation, and while better usages would come decades later, they actually look pretty convincing for their time. Also, I must give props to the singing and the song choices, as listening to these songs will make anyone jump out of their seat and dance to it all. Although, just because these musical numbers are fun to listen to sporadically does not mean mashing them together is a good idea, and that's why this film kind of fails in the long run.I'm not going to lie, I really do appreciate a lot of the small stories, animation, music and even humor of The Three Caballeros, and there's no denying how much effort and craftsmanship was put into it. However, seeing all this great stuff crammed into 72 minutes worth of a movie just feels irritating, because too much of them is way too much to handle. You can have all the dancing and pizazz you want, but when you sacrifice an actual story for it all, something that every film needs to work, it just comes off as tiring and repetitive. If you want to give this a watch, just watch the segments individually, because you'll have a much easier time sitting through them then wasting 72 minutes on a pointless pasteup flick. Thank goodness Disney stopped doing package films after Cinderella became a hit, because the more we would get of this, the less magic would be prevalent."], ["I think you need to be a Disney fan - but it's colourful and lively enough for kids to enjoy", "Among his birthday presents, Donald Duck finds a projector, a screen and a roll of film.  He puts them on and finds it is a film about his Southern relations - a subject Donald would confess he knows very little about.  He watches several stories about a cold penguin, a flying donkey and a cigar chewing parrot who introduces him to the beauties (literally) of Brazilian and Mexican culture.This film was made in an attempt to expose American audiences to cultures other than their own and encourage understanding - apparently, back in the 1940's, America was an insular country with little tolerance or understanding of the issues regarding the rest of the world (of course, that's all changed now).  Anyway, in trying to do this, it is difficult to fault the film for it's intensions but it is a lot easier to fault it for it's accomplishments.  The basic plot is split into several sections based around several characters.  The first few are more or less cartoons that don't really comment much on the other cultures, but the second half mixes animation with live action in an attempt to show how much fun Brazil and Mexico can be.The first half is bright and colourful and may distract young children but the second half is only interesting because it is rhythmic and energetic - but did it help me appreciate Mexico? Nope!  For me, the bigger failing was that this film wasn't very funny.  However I suspected that as I came to it - I am more of a Loony Tunes fan as I prefer the madcap comedy that those cartoons bring rather than the more `wholesome' fun of Disney cartoons of the period.If I had to pick one cartoon duck, it would be Daffy of course, and I'm not a big fan of Donald simply because I can't understand what he is saying half the time.  The various other players here are colourful and do what they are required to do but again I prefer a bit of an edge on my characters - and Disney is not the place to get that.  The real people are OK but are not really the people you would have seen in these place at the time (or even now!).  They are very airbrushed and more often than not they are have had `ethnic' qualities reduced to costume in an effort to show how `they look just like us'.Overall this is a bright and colourful feature that will distract young children.  It doesn't achieve it's aim of enlightening about other cultures, nor does it have much of a story or laughs to keep adults interesting.  It is a worthy try and will appeal to Disney fans but most others will have pressed `stop' before the end."], ["Totally weird", "I thought this movie was made during the late sixties where hallucinagenic drugs were readily available.

The film is storied in segments, each one starting when Donald unwraps each of his presents.

His adventures throughout Latin America was potentially a treat to watch and the featured music (courtesy of singers Aurora Miranda, Dora Luz and Carmen Molina) was somewhat catchy and enjoyable. However, I thought the overall movie was a little on the dull side and not very magically captivating like you would expect in many of Disney's feature films.While Fantasia was also filmed in segments (like this movie) and consists of music and animation only and no dialog, that movie will make you at least appreciate classical music and beautiful animation and, while no dialog, each segment is filmed in a way that represents charm and personality where you could actually follow its purpose. This film really has no plot, just a mash of animation and live action in a huge dance fest and party in Latin America. It's like a never-ending parade with nothing too intriguing to grab your attention.

Basicallly Donald Duck is celebrating his birthday, and he has received a big box from his friends in Latin America, and it contains three gifts. The first gift is a film projector with a film all about fascinating birds from around the world, including the story of the penguin Pablo who travels to paradise, the eccentric Aracuan, and the story of a Gauchito who finds a flying donkey and the two of them find friendship and brief fortune. The second gift is parrot Jos\u00e9 Carioca from Rio De Janeiro in a pop up book telling Donald all about his favourite Brazilian state Bahia, and after shrinking his friend to his size he takes him on a journey to the place to meet the locals, dance the samba and see the sights. After leaving the book and using black magic to return to normal size, the two of them open the third and final gift which contains rooster Panchito the Caballero from Mexico, who gives them each a sombrero, and they become the Three Caballeros. After cracking open a pi\u00f1ata, Panchito takes Donald and Jos\u00e9 with them as they by flying carpet, or serape, through the pages of a book that come to life and show the many wonderful places of Mexico, such as P\u00e1tzcuaro, Vera Cruz and Acapulco beach.

Luckily in \"The Three Caballeros\" the action only takes place in Mexico and Brazil. Of course, there are some attractive things, such as the proto-psychedelic animation of Mary Blair that would flourish in \"Alice in Wonderland\" (Disney's most \"stoned\" feature, if you ask me), but almost by rule all is offensive: stereotypes, ridiculous characters or cultural mockery. All the plot offers is Donald Duck opening presents on his birthday, from two Latin American friends: Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Carioca (from \"Saludos Amigos\") and Mexican Panchito (Villa, I suppose). Each time a box is open you watch an animated sequence of native songs (including a horrendous English version of maestro Manuel Esper\u00f3n's \"Ay Jalisco no te rajes\"). Donald Duck (who looks a lot like Donald Trump in his arrogant behavior) even harasses several Latin women, anticipating the days of his namesake. The only thing that seemed fantastic to me (and it's personal taste, of course) was Carmen Miranda's sister, the sinuous Aurora Miranda who sings and dances in a beautiful and colorful musical sequence composed by Ary Barroso. If Disney has kept \"Song of the South\" out of circulation because of \"offensive treatment of African-American\" this film could deserve the same medicine. However, the only thing Disney executives seem to find objectionable is that the characters smoke, so in the DVD edition cigars and cigarettes were deleted, except the one in Jos\u00e9 Carioca's peak...

I suspect that most of the people in hispanophone and lusophone America who saw it left the theater thinking \"Disney has a weird idea of goodwill.\" Basically, it makes the region look like a nonstop party, always populated by sexy women. The representatives are a pair of exuberant birds: a suave Brazilian parrot and a hyperactive Mexican rooster. A real look at Latin America would focus on colonialism and poverty. To be certain, Brazil bulldozed favelas to make room for the World Cup stadium (which will probably never get used again).I know, this movie wasn't really meant to be serious.

Even though the segments which comprise the film vary in quality, the film as a whole is a bright, colorful and amusing light entertainment which fit wartime needs ideally.Highlights include two spirited Benny Goodman swing numbers (\"All The Cats Join In\" and \"After You've Gone\") and the unforgettable finale, \"Willie the Operatic Whale\", narrated and sung by Nelson Eddy. The animation is generally first-rate and the Technicolor film will dazzle any viewer not expecting a genuine masterwork.Make Mine Music was successful enough to warrant a considerably better follow-up, Melody Time (1948).The undistinguished but harmless \"Martins and the Coys\" segment, concerning the gun-feuding backwoods families of American folklore, has idiotically been removed from current editions, evidently for PC reasons. It's scary that Disney may start altering their classics to meet artificial modern standards.

But like it is with \"Melody Time\" the success of the shorts is variable.\"The Martins and the Coys\"(10/10)-Man I loved this! Probably the most underrated of all the shorts featured in this film. It mayn't be to everyone's tastes now, and it does stereotype the Appalachians, but what makes it so enormously entertaining is the fluid and colourful quality of the animation, the rollicking soundtrack and the vocals.\"Blue Bayou\"(10/10)- I don't know where to begin praising \"Blue Bayou\". Whether it was the stunning animation, with the pristine and perfect blue backgrounds, the poetic lyrics and the lyrical, sensual melody of the song. And the music is sublimely sung.\"All the Cats Join In\"(10/10)-One cool and jazzy cartoon. I am not always that fond of jazz admittedly, but the music courtesy of Benny Goodman and his orchestra is wonderful. Topped with clever and sophisticated animation and the story, even for a combination cartoon, works effectively.\"Without You\"(9/10)- I liked this, the animation is gorgeous in this sequence and the song itself is sweet and memorable. Andy Russell does a good job with the singing. I will say though it doesn't rank as a favourite, and I can't put my finger on why, maybe it was to do with where it was placed in the film.\"Casey at the Bat\"(8/10)-The pace is rushed here, but this cartoon is entertaining. I for one liked Jerry Colonna's mini-commentary-like vocals here, and I liked the animation too. \"Casey at the Bat\" is also very funny, certainly makes a game of baseball entertaining.\"Two Silhouettes\"(8/10)-Don't get me wrong, I really liked this sequence. It is sentimental and sappy of course, but it looked beautiful, with graceful dancing, and the song was lovely, sensitively sung by Dinah Shore.\"Peter and the Wolf\"(9.5/10)-Easily one of the better shorts of the film. Not my personal favourite by all means, but definitely memorable. The animation is beautiful here, the music is outstanding and the story is effective. Not to mention the characters are very well done, in fact the Wolf when my sister and I were little was so scary for us, my sister still refuses to see this cartoon, as she got nightmares from the Wolf and the French horn motif played to signify his entrance.\"After You've Gone\"(8/10)- I do prefer \"All the Cats Join In\" but this is full of jazz and pizazz. It's running time though is disappointingly scant, and it is a tad rushed. The artwork is beautifully done though, and the music is wonderful. Another example of a combination cartoon, and works well at it.\"Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet\"(10/10)- I love how beautiful, simple and poignant this is. Coupled with nice animation, lovely music and beautifully blended vocals from the Andrews Sisters, this is a definite must.\"Willie the Operatic Whale\"(or \"The Whale Who Wanted to Sing At the Met\")(10/10)-Save the best until last I'd say. Along with \"Peter and the Wolf\" this is the only other cartoon from the film I was familiar with before watching. This one is unforgettable, truly unforgettable with a truly special whale. The animation is gorgeous and charming, and the singing from undervalued Nelson Eddy is outstanding. What made this though was the opera music, it was wonderful to hear \"Largo Al Factotum\" from \"Barber of Seville\" and \"Sextet\" from \"Lucia Di Lammermoor\" to name a few. This was the cartoon that introduced me to the wonderful world of opera, that's why it is so special to be.Overall, while there are one or two sequences that aren't as good as others, \"Make Mine Music\" is beautifully crafted, and I would recommend it. 8/10 Bethany Cox"], ["Some great sequences, and some duds...", "An episodic musical tapestry a' la Fantasia, only this one utilizes the pop music of circa 1946.

The Benny Goodman numbers are superb - musically and animation-wise - but then I'm a B.G.fan and ever will be. \"Peter and the Wolf\" persuaded me to listen to the real classical version and, subsequently, to buy the sound track record. Perhaps I do agree with the viewer who found Jerry Colonna's rendering of \"Casey\" a lemon but then you either take Jerry's versions of things or you don't.

Like \"Fantasia\", these films strung together various shorts and featurettes into a feature-length anthology. Between their release in the 1940s and the DVD age, these films were rarely, if ever, shown in their entirety. Instead, the individual segments were re-released as stand-alone pieces, some of which became quite popular. It's understandable why this was done. Whereas the individual elements of \"Fantasia\" have a similar enough artistic vision to be kept intact as a single experience, the package features do seem like a line of random, individual shorts that have been strung together. As such, the films can seem quite uneven and somewhat unsatisfying collectively.In particular, \"Make Mine Music\" stands out as being one of the most inconsistent package features. It consists of ten shorts, all relying heavily on music. Some of the shorts are fairly conventional, story-driven, while others are quite experimental. The real stand-out pieces are \"Peter and the Wolf\" (initially considered for a sequel/continuation of \"Fantasia\") and \"The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met\". The stories are engaging, and they are absolutely charming, although \"Peter and the Wolf\" relies a bit too much on narration. It comes as no surprise that these two shorts became the film's most famous segments. Special mention should also be given to \"Blue Bayou\", which uses footage from a deleted segment of \"Fantasia\" that was to be set to Debussy's \"Clair de Lune\" (here, though, it's set to a love ballad).Other segments, however, vary. \"The Martins and the Coys\", which was rather stupidly removed from the American DVD, is not bad but hardly memorable. \"After You've Gone\", an interlude featuring anthropomorphised musical instruments, means well but falls quite flat, ultimately appearing as not much more than filler. \"All the Cats Join In\" and \"Without You\" equally seem like experimental filler, yet both are more successful. \"Casey at the Bat\", on the other hand, contains too many self-indulgent gags and overly caricatured animation to be of any real artistic or entertainment merit, a fact not helped by Jerry Colona's obnoxious narration. The two other segments, \"Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet\" and \"Two Silhouettes\", are so cutesy that they become nothing but pieces of unadulterated kitsch.Ultimately, the only people I would recommend \"Make Mine Music\" to would be the people who would only be interested in it - Disney fans and animation buffs.

Part II - featuring the Top 40's... OF the 40's", "Of all Walt Disney's animated films, there are 5 features that a huge amount of people have never heard of. Saludos Amigos (1943) is one, but it's not fully feature-length (it's only 45 minutes, so it shouldn't even count when you always hear those Disney video & DVD announcements that say \"Our 20-whatever-TH full-length animated classic...,\" but they actually do count it). The excellent Fun and Fancy Free (1947) is another. The Adventures of Ichabod & Mr. Toad (1949). And then, there are the 2 sequels to Fantasia (1940): Melody Time (1948) and this film, Make Mine Music (1946). The reason you probably haven't heard much about them is that, first- they were \"Package Films\" which were never really that popular AS package films, and second- they didn't make a lot of money for the studio when they were released in theaters in the 1940's. In fact, Disney would have gone extinct forever in 1950 (many say) if Cinderella had not have been a huge hit (which it was).I say, they are sequels to Fantasia because they are made almost the exact same way. They lack a Composer / Orchestrator character to link them together, but when one segment ends, another simply begins. So basically, if you liked Fantasia, all you need to like this movie is some appreciation for the music you hear here. And this really is in the same sort of style as the music we hear in several Disney films. There's jazz (which you hear in The Aristocats, 1970), classical (every Disney film, animated or non), and interpretive stuff. I may not be a huge fan of any of these styles of music, personally, but that's what's great about Disney. They can put animation to it and make you like it or appreciate it more.The first thing that should probably be said is that the wonderful people at Walt Disney Home Video, have taken it upon themselves to edit one of the musical segments entirely out of all prints of the film available on VHS and DVD. Isn't that nice of them? Without any proper explanation why - if you haven't seen it already, you're not going to see it ever (and I checked, it's not on You Tube). I've never seen it, so I can't comment on it.The segments in the film can be put into 3 categories. 1- Storyline, 2- Interpretive, and 3- Combination. \"Peter and the Wolf\" and \"The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met\" are Storyline. So they are longer than the others and take more time to tell. Both are good stories, if you like opera and folk / fairy tales. Though, \"Peter\" is probably the best (certainly it's been said it's Walt Disney's favorite), some of the animation / color choices here seem a little too wacky for Americans. \"Whale\" is underwhelming but has a memorable ending (it was a mistake, I think, to have the 1 opera singer doing all the speaking voices too).\"Blue Bayou,\" \"Without You,\" \"Two Silhouettes,\" and \"After You've Gone,\" (big surprise) are Interpretive. No characters, no story. Just a song with some lyrics, and pure art. \"Bayou\" and \"Without\" are very beautiful and a little haunting. \"Silhouettes\" is truly classic and lovely, if also the most boring part of the movie. \"After\" has no lyrics but is very fun and upbeat.Then finally, \"All the Cats Join In,\" \"Casey at the Bat,\" and \"Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet\" are Combination. Which means, they have stories, but they are entirely told through one long, continuous song or don't take any breaks. \"Casey\" is funny, without a doubt (even though it's quite offensive, in one moment, to overweight people). \"Johnnie\" is definitely a fan favorite, and is kind of sad too. And \"Cats\" is fast-paced, so it's entertaining. But it doesn't speak too kindly of the youth of the 1940's. They are portrayed as quite elitist and discriminating.So, unlike most Disney films (and even their package films), this film rests entirely on the strength of each individual segment / short. And some of these aren't memorable, while most are slightly below average quality. No Disney movie to buy on DVD is cheap, but with these Disney titles, you usually get a bonus cartoon. So I recommend purchase for true Disney fans. If you're looking for something to rent - I recommend only for you alone, if you're a Disney completest. But for your family, there are more appropriate and sensitive Disney films. Most films act as art, and as that, Make Mine Music does provide some average stuff worth seeing.

Otherwise, you might find the soundtrack quite boring. Much of the segments weren't very appealing as it didn't stand out as far as personality, fun, or charm, which is something another segmented film, Fantasia, had. The Peter and the Wolf, fedora and bonnet love story, and the singing whale segments were the only ones that grabbed any of my attention.While unique, the overall film is not an attention grabber and children certainly wouldn't be able to sit through it.

They made several of these during and after World War II. It's a fun movie with cartoons of varying quality but none are bad. Many of these cartoons were released later as theatrical shorts. There are ten segments. The most popular of them is probably \"Casey at the Bat,\" a recitation by Jerry Colonna of the famous poem. It's a funny, wacky baseball cartoon that was one of my favorites as a kid (seen on a compilation video). Other well-known parts include the Disney version of \"Peter and the Wolf,\" \"The Martins and the Coys,\" which is now considered politically incorrect by those who make such determinations, and \"The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met,\" featuring Nelson Eddy. These are all fine cartoons, though the last one has a surprisingly downbeat ending. The 'worst' shorts are the ones that have no real story, just offer a few minutes of animation to some song, almost like a music video of sorts. \"Blue Bayou,\" \"Without You,\" and \"Two Silhouettes,\" for example. They aren't bad shorts, just slight. They feel like time filler. My two favorite shorts in the whole movie are \"All the Cats Join In\" and \"Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet.\" 'Cats' is an energetic big band number with Benny Goodman music playing while a pencil draws the action as it happens. It's creative and cute with a surprisingly sexy part. You'll have to watch it to see what I mean. 'Fedora' is a sweet story about two hats (yes, hats) falling in love and becoming separated. This is narrated through song by the great Andrews Sisters. Overall, some nice little shorts that should please old-school Disney fans. Good animation and music. A very pleasant movie that will leave you with a smile on your face."], ["Mixed bag, but a winner overall!", "These \"potpourri\" musicals Disney made in the late 40's are usually variable, but this feature's my favorite among that whole batch. The Disney guys are always at their best in animation emphasizing characterization, and those musical sketches stressing this are the ones that work best. But one of the centerpieces here always struck me as Disney at his all-time worst: his attempts to duplicate the artistic success of \"Fantasia\" with a jumbled treatment of \"Peter and the Wolf.\" I have yet to see a successful visualization of this piece....better to hear it on records, since this is largely a \"theater-of-the-mind\" piece, geared to help youngsters learn about some of the instruments of the orchestra. The Disney guys turn it into pure sap. But \"Casey at the Bat,\" \"Johnny Fedora & Alice Bluebonnet,\" \"The Martins & the Coys,\" and especially \"All the Cats Join In\" and \"Willie the Singing Whale\" more than make up for what surrounds them.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Horribly uneven--ranging from the very good and memorable to the insipid and awful.", "\"Make Mine Music\" is another post-war feature film that is actually a compilation of shorts all packaged together--like \"Fun and Fancy Free\", \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\", \"Saludos, Amigos\" and the like. And, for the most part, these films marked a low-point in Disney history--as the great quality and artistry of their earlier full-length films (such as \"Snow White\", \"Bambi\" and \"Pinocchio\") and before the studio's rejuvenated late 40s and 1950s (with films such as \"Cinderella\" and \"Peter Pan\"). Much of this is probably due to the studio staff experiencing HUGE changes after WWII and a protracted union strike--and a very sizable number of animators and other artists were lost. Unlike the other features released just after the war, the shorts in \"Make Mine Music\" were very, very short.\"Blue Bayou\"--Thankfully this was a very short film, as I was contemplating suicide it was so boring and dreadful. The music was somewhat like Jeanette/Nelson Eddy music and seemed very dated...and dull. 1\"All Cats Come Join In\"--Benny Goodman and his orchestra provide the music and the style is a jazzy big-band sort of tune. The animation VERY simple--with characters with very non-detailed faces and backgrounds. While the music integrated well with the music and it was enjoyable, it would NEVER be confused with \"Fantasia\" as the look of this short was rather cheap. 3\"A Ballade in Blue\"--A dull affair as a whiny guy sings about how life sucks without his beloved. Sure to make kids angry and restless. 1\"Casey At The Bat\"--Probably the best and most famous of the shorts in this film. Jerry Colonna narrated the famous poem and it really came to life due to the silliness of the animation--which was reminiscent of a Goofy short. Too bad this short was so unlike the rest of the film and didn't seem to really fit the theme--which was really dull music and animation! There was only incidental music and this short forgot to be boring. 8\"Two Silhouettes\"--Dinah Shore sings as silhouettes of a man and woman dance together. Frankly, if the earlier shorts didn't drive kids crazy with boredom, this one is sure to do it. Dull. 1\"Peter and the Wolf\"--Oddly, this one began with a narration (Sterling Holloway--who later played Winnie the Pooh) as he explains how various instruments represent various characters in the story--then he continues to explain the story as the music plays. While I am not a huge fan of this short, it is head and shoulders better than most of them--and certainly is entertaining. Not a great film for most kids (unless they are a Frasier or Niles Crane sort of kid who adores classical or neo-classical music). But, it might also serve as a nice way to introduce kids to this sort of music. The animation of this one is noticeably better than the rest of the film and most adults should enjoy this film. 8\"After You've Gone\"--The Goodman Quartet (including Benny Goodman) provide some bouncy music during which musical instruments, keyboards, fingers, etc. come to life. While kids will also surely hate this one, adults will probably find the music and animation zippy good fun. I didn't hate it. 6\"Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet\"--Sung by the Andrews Sisters, this is the story about two hats that fall in love---something you DON'T see everyday! This is a pretty weird cartoon. Again, kids probably won't love this one but it was amazingly cute seeing these anthropomorphic hats. And the Andrews Sisters' music is pretty enjoyable and cute. 7\"Opera Pathetique\"--This is sung by Nelson Eddy whose style of music is not to my liking although it was popular back in grand-pappy's day. The animation is much more enjoyable than most of the rest of the film but the singing is very operatic. If that's your thing, then are you in for a treat. However, if you think this sort of music is LESS enjoyable than hearing a cat being tortured, then it will be a chore to watch even with the cute animation of a gigantic singing whale. Cute but probably not everyone's cup 'o tea. 5Overall, the film was hard to watch because it was so wildly uneven---it just frustrates the viewer to no end. Some of the shorts are very nice but many are just plain awful. Kids will most likely hate most of it and it's best you only show them a few selections. Adults will be, on the whole, more patient and willing to stick with it--particularly if they loved \"Fantasia\"--though the quality of \"Fantasia\" was almost always much higher--especially in regard to the artwork.

The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met, the finishing segment, is also great in its own bombastic way. Personally I find it perhaps a bit unambitious, but it's a fun idea done well.There are also couple story segments that don't really grab you, like Casey at the Bat, a baseball story, and Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet, a hat love story, which are both animated well but lack a captivating storyline.

It's always neat what animators managed to slip into their cartoons.Overall, a lot of the content was too flowery for my tastes, but I did like the vignette about the singing whale.

This was the time the classic Disney figures were being born. But it was also the time of experimentation, we finally had the ability to display the wonderful stories that music tells to us.It takes you on a journey through different genres and emotions, and gives you a small window into the 40s. In my opinion it is far better than many films that are out today in regards to emotional involvement (strangely). I don't always want to wait hours into a film to get involved with a character who is frankly just another john smith.

Apart from the hilarious \"well she used to be a good milker, but now... she is an udder failure\" he didn't really make an impact on me.

Bongo tells the rather simple story of the adorable Bongo and his endeavour into a world he has never known before, after being the star attraction of a circus. It is very sweet and well meaning, and the narration isn't so bad either. Mickey and the Beanstalk is a favourite of mine. Wonderful voice acting, terrific animation especially for the beanstalk and nice music made this memorable for me.Other things that impressed were one Jiminy Cricket of course, well how can he not impress, he is a classic character in the history of animation?

After the end of the story, there are a few more live-action scenes like this and Jiminy Cricket appears in both.As for the segment itself, needless to say it is based on \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". It's not a bad segment, but honestly I found it nothing special. It features, however, well known cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy.

The result were movies like this one as well as \"Make Mine Music\" and \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\" which are essentially movies that seem a bit disjoint, as the theme that links the shorts is tenuous at best. Here, \"Fun and Fancy Free\" is a vague term and really has nothing to do with the cartoons. In addition, the quality of the two cartoons is quite different.The first cartoon, \"Bongo\", frankly is awfully lame. Despite having some nice splashy colors, the story is weak and should have supported an 8-10 minute film--not a short running over a half hour. Plus, so much of the film seemed like filler--with LOTS and LOTS of singing from Dinah Shore and others. It's the story of a miserable circus bear who longs to be free. But, when a chance opportunity occurs and he escapes, life in the wild isn't as easy as he expected. Apart from a few cute characters (including a girl bear--you can tell because she has a flower growing out of her head), there isn't much to recommend it. I assume kids of the day really were bored by the cartoon and its watchability is not great. I'd score this one a 4---mostly because the animation is pretty good.The final cartoon is the one kids will love, as it features Mickey, Donald and Goofy. Oddly, however, unlike the first cartoon, this one features a lot of live-action--with Edgar Bergen and his puppets entertaining a cute little girl with a Disney-fied version of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". In this version, the three heroes take on the mean giant--wonderfully brought to life by the voice of Billy Gilbert. While it's clearly a variation of an earlier Disney film (\"The Brave Little Tailor\"), it still is very watchable and cute. Not a brilliant film, nevertheless it actually makes \"Fun and Fancy Free\" worth seeing. Plus, fans of Edgar Bergen will enjoy seeing him and his characters. I particularly enjoyed Charlie's 'Udder failure' comment. I'd give this one an 8.Overall, it's a highly uneven and odd hodgepodge that, frankly, is not especially great viewing.

This story was narrated by Dinah Shore, who also sings. Lovely voice. Modern viewers, particularly those with a dark sense of humor, might see a domestic violence message in this one. Bongo was something of a 'gangsta.'The second story is the Mickey Mouse version of Jack and the Beanstalk. I know I saw this one many times as a kid but, for the life of me, I don't remember seeing Bongo before today. So perhaps this was released on a VHS collection or something back in the day, separate from this film. This one is narrated by ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, who also appears in a live action segment doing his puppet routine in what appears to be a private birthday party for a little girl who I hoped was his daughter but turns out it was Disney child star Luana Patten. A little creepy but different times.Jiminy Cricket also appears in the beginning and in a linking segment from the first story to the second. As always with classic Disney, the animation is excellent, with beautiful drawings and rich colors. Love the music, as well.

Although the cartoon is cute and amusing, Bergen and his dummies along with the adorable Luana Patten provide the bulk of the laughs. I can't help but compare the approach in this segment to \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" because of the good-natured riffing done by Charlie and Mortimer. It makes you wish that Walt Disney had used this formula for other films like \"Alice in Wonderland\" or \"Cinderella.\" It goes without saying that Charlie's riffing on Bergen's storytelling is a particular highlight.I say see this film.

So instead, I will say that this was just an OK Disney film for the era which it came from.I do have a soft spot for Bongo, 'cause we could use a sweet story during times like these. The only downfall is that sometimes it gets so sweet, I need one of those OneTouch machines to keep track of my insulin levels. One such example (MINOR SPOILER) is when Bongo meets Lulubelle and they go into this whole sequence where just about every single love clich\u00e9/device/gimmick is being shown.

Otherwise, it's a cute story that goes beyond cute.Afterwards, The live action stuff with Edgar (Candace's Father) Bergen boosts the film a little.

Apparently, they were huge back in the day.Enter Mickey & The Beanstalk and it's essentially the same story as the one we read as kids (CONTINUITY SPOILER). Only there's three heroes instead of just one, and A Golden Harp, but no goose that lays golden eggs. Other than that, nothing to write home about.All in all, it's a crowd pleaser at best.

Disney doesn't get more historically curious than this", "\"Bambi\" (1942) was the last REAL animated feature the Disney studio released in the 1940s.  Until 1950, there would only be shorts - which in general weren't as good either as the innovative ones made in the 1930s, or Jack Hannah's comic masterpieces of the 1950s - and compilation features: \"The Reluctant Dragon\" (1941), \"Saludos Amigos\" (1943), \"The Three Caballeros\" (1945), \"Make Mine Music\" (1946), \"Fun and Fancy Free\" (1947), \"Melody Time\" (1948), \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\" (1949).  You're unlikely to have seen ANY of these.  All of them were stripped apart into their component pieces long ago, largely because, with the exception of \"The Three Caballeros\", there's no reason to keep any of them in one piece. (\"Fantasia\" is another exception, so much so that I've left it off the list altogether - it's a completely different kind of endeavour.)I say this even though \"The Three Caballeros\" is the only one I'VE seen.  I have seen most of the material that went into these movies, though, and trust me: it's uneven, and there's no coherent way of gluing most of it together.  -\"Fun and Fancy Free\", in any event, consists of just two extended shorts: \"Bongo\" and \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\".  I'm writing mainly to defend the latter.  People are much too hard on it.  There's a marked similarity between it and the winning short cartoon \"The Brave Little Tailor\" (1938), another fairytale with Disney characters taking the lead roles, and while \"Beanstalk\" lacks the earlier short's freshness, it has the advantage of having Donald and Goofy in it, two terribly under-rated cartoon stars who, although capable of sustaining shorts on their own, play off well against one another.  (That's why it's impossible to make a Mickey/Donald/Goofy cartoon that's a TOTAL failure.)  \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\" is one of the few post-war cartoons to recapture the spirit of Disney's depression-era stuff.\"Bongo\" is of almost no interest - a vapid, directionless account of a circus bear who must adapt to life in the wild, complete with songs.  People interested in the history of animation should see every Disney production they can get their eyes on; there's no other reason to see this one.  The sheer POINTLESSNESS of pairing \"Bongo\" with \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\" makes this Disney's most bizarre compilation feature of the decade.  -I wish I'd seen the linking segments.  They can't possibly JUSTIFY the film's arbitrary nature, but it might be entertaining to see them try."], ["Watch it for the animation, but don't expect that much else.", "While Fun & Fancy Free wasn't terrible, I think it is the weakest of the package movies from the war time era of Disney.It's a collection of two segments joined together by Jiminy Cricket taking us to two different locations which are a bedroom and a livingroom. The first one being the place where the story of Bongo the circus bear begins. A simple story about Bongo longing to be in the wild after serving his entire life in a circus. He doesn't know the wild so he goes through some trials to learn how to be in the wild while he finds love. I may be among the few people who put this much though into a cartoon, but the way the bears show affection was a little disturbing to me. Judge it for yourself, though.The latter is in a livingroom where Jiminy watches this birthday party or something where the vetriloquist tells Mickey and the Beanstalk which is pretty much Jack and the Beanstalk without much change put into it. The animated part was good, but the one puppet, Charlie, gets annoying very quickly when constantly interrupts the narration to make stupid comments. Again, the animated parts are really nice in both segments, but the live action parts are kind of dated.

The second story is \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\" which is a new take on the classic fairy tale.Little Bear Bongo didn't get much traction. I don't see him as that charismatic. He's a bit of a sad sack. Quite frankly, I've never heard of him before this movie. The songs aren't that catchy. Bongo defeating the mean bear is expected although I expect the battle to be more imaginative. It's not much. I have similar feelings about Charlie McCarthy. He may be a childhood classic for a generation but that generation isn't my generation. On the other hand, Mickey Beanstalk is a classic. It is iconic.

The animation's great, the songs are memorable and catchy and the stories for as short as they were kept my attention. Jiminy Cricket is the host of this two-part movie. He first turns on a record which plays the story of Bongo the Bear narrated by Dinah Shore. Bongo's a bear who's a popular act in the circus he works in. His talent's being able to ride a unicycle while juggling various things on a tight rope. Though a success it quickly becomes old for Bongo who wants out of the circus to live like a wild bear.One day while on a train ride he escapes by a miracle and makes his way to the woods. At first he's happy but then slowly begins to realize how hard living in the wild is as he has to deal with finding food and surviving extreme weather such as a tornado. As Bongo slowly begins to learn how to survive he falls in love with another bear named Lulubelle who returns his feelings and shows it (like other bears do) by slapping him much to his confusion. After he realizes what it means he rushes back to save his mate from his rival Lumpjaw and after defeating him he and Lulubelle celebrate along with the other bears.When the story's finished Jiminy makes his way to a party hosted by ventriloquist Edgar Bergen who also narrates the last story Mickey and the Beanstalk. Listening to him are his dummies slow-witted Mortimer Snerd and smart mouth Charlie McCarthy, Cricket and child actor Luana Patton (it's a little creepy now that I think about it). It's interesting to note that this was the last time Walt Disney would voice Mickey Mouse before stepping down due to being busy with other projects as well losing his voice due to smoking which led to Jimmy MacDonald taking over afterwards. It plays out like the original story though with a few twists here and there. Long ago, the land Mickey and his friends lived on was prosperous due to the Harp's singing but that all changed after Willie the Giant selfishly stole her for personal reasons. This leaves the land in a drought and the residents in absolute poverty.Probably the most effected is Donald Duck who goes nuts not once but twice over the lack of food. The first time he tells Bergen while narrating to shut up before proceeding to try and eat a sandwich of plates and other utensils before Mickey and Goofy intervene. He cools down at first only to snap again and try to kill their cow in which he nearly succeeds had Mickey and Goofy not have stepped in. Fearing for the cows safety Mickey trades it for some magic beans much to Donald's frustration who knocks them out of Mickey's hand and onto the floor where they fall into a hole and grow at night into a giant beanstalk.When the trio wakes up the next morning they explore the beanstalk and make their way into Willie's castle where they find the harp. The humor's that Willie's an imposing giant with the ability to shape-shift and fly but he's also dopey and has a weird appetite. When they're caught they try to trick Willie into turning him into a fly but Willie catches on and traps them save for Mickey who escapes and manages to get the key with the help of the harp who sings a lullaby for Willie in hopes of him falling asleep. As the trio escape with the harp Mickey tries to tie Willie's shoelaces together but he wakes up leading to an awesome chase scene. My favorite scene's when Mickey uses a Wine bottle cork to blast his way out of the castle.They narrowly make it down the beanstalk then saw it down in hopes of killing the giant. With the harp returned, the land returns to its original form. After the story's finished it's revealed that Willie survived and exists much to Bergen's shock. The film ends with Willie exploring Hollywood in hopes of looking for Mickey. I really liked this movie as a kid and I still like it today. The live action/animation blend's amazing. Keep in mind this was way before Roger Rabbit so they had to get it right and it really shows. When the cartoon characters move in the real world they look like they're there, the shadows move like you would expect. Even the dummies look they're actually talking to Edger Bergen and I think the banter they carry is funny. They also have good chemistry.There's also a decent balance of narration and letting the scenery and actions tell the story. The animation's smooth and bright. Kids will like the bouncy characters and the backgrounds. The songs are memorable. I really like the title song, \"In My Favorite Dream\", \"What a Lovely Day\", \"Fee Fi Fo Fum\", they're just so catchy. The characters are likable both live-action and animated. Luana Patten's adorable, Edger Bergen and his dummies are funny and have good chemistry as well as the trio, Mickey's likable as ever and easy to root for and Willie's funny to laugh at. One thing that's strange is how if Willie had powers why didn't he use them in the chase scene? Also why are there no other adults at the party particularly Patten's parents? It's weird that a little girl is by herself with a man twice her age. As much as I like the movie I will admit it hasn't completely aged well in terms of jokes and dialogue. The banter may come off as corny and annoying to some but nevertheless i'm willing to overlook those flaws and recommend this to others. If you like old fashioned Disney animation and 1940's style comedy then this's for you. If you want something with more Mickey you'll get it though i'm not sure if you'll be Fun and Fancy Free afterwards.

Two of these were Bongo and The Legend Of Happy Valley. Work began as early as early as 1940, but were shelved due to several setbacks.Like every feature that the studio produced in the immediate post-war years, this was a compilation of unrelated stories or visuals. Both stories were cut down in length to accommodate a feature length, much like The Wind And The Willows was. I've wanted to see what the studio's vision was for these stories as feature films.Disney had largely moved away from frightening sequences by this point. They still had occasional dark moments but it was toned down to a dramatic atmosphere. What you'll see here is a very lighthearted feel good film. Bongo doesn't really offer much story wise, but Dinah Shore's narration and singing interludes make it a very enjoyable segment. Mickey And The Beanstalk as narrated by Edgar Bergan makes for an interesting period piece. This is the best Mickey, Donald, and Goofy outting. This time they function as a team working through many perilous obstacles and comical situations. The Singing Harp almost anticipates Cinderella (different voice actress though).While Disney's package films are not well remembered and were panned by the studio staff, they do present a lot of light hearted and enjoyable moments. This film is a prelude to the studio's Silver Age of the 1950's."], ["A very fun Disney anthology film!", "Fun & Fancy Free starts with the beloved character Jiminy Cricket, he tells the story of Bongo.\nBongo is about a circus bear who falls off his train and gets lost in the woods, he finds some wild bears and must learn to fit in.\nJiminy then meets his ventriloquist neighbor who tells him the story of Mickey and the Beanstalk.\nMickey, Donald & Goofy star together in the short take on Jack and the Beanstalk, in which they are stressed from lack of money and food, they get their hands on magic beans and use to reach the land of giants.As a whole the film fits tonally well.

The first animated piece, staring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy, is a retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk. The second, an original story about a dancing bear, Bongo, that discovers the wilds of nature. The live animation pieces are down right awful. It is a birthday 'party' consisting of two children and an adult who is a ventriloquist. First, ventriloquism is not an act that translates well to a TV medium. Especially when you can see the human's mouth move. Second, these live-action scenes feel heavy-handed, not natural and certainly not funny or enjoyable. If you bought this video, you'd probably end up fast forwarding past these parts every viewing to get to the animation. Which brings me to the animated parts. The first one is decent (I'll get to that in a minute), but the second one, centering around Bongo is especially cringe- worthy. Over the course of the short, Bongo discovers a female bear, falls in love, and learns that the best way to show love to someone is to slap them. Wow. What a lesson. There's even a whole song dedicated to showing someone you love them \"with a slap\". Can I just take a moment to wonder what the script writer was thinking here?The Good:The saving grace of this film is the first animated segment. Mickey and pals go on a semi-epic quest, and it's honestly fun and humorous, and enjoyable. If I were rating just this part of this video, I'd give it a solid 7 or 8 stars.The Mom View:Two-thirds of this movie is not worth watching, but I really like the Mickey and the Beanstalk part. That makes this a tough one for me. For just that one animated segment, I'd say this is appropriate for pre-schoolers and up and that it's certainly a recommended show. However, since that cartoon comes attached to the rest, I can't recommend anything more than a rental (or perhaps YouTube).

Quite simply, Willie with the IE spelling is a stereotypical name of blues singers, such as Willie Dixon. I wonder how a blues song about Jack and the Beanstalk would go.As for Edgar Bergen, I suspect that Candice Bergen used to be known as his daughter, and now he's probably known as Candice Bergen's father. I liked Charlie McCarthy's and Mortimer Snerd's mildly sarcastic commentary; it wasn't like on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" but still funny.In the end it's no great movie but nothing harmful.

By that, I mean that instead of telling one story over the course of 80 or so minutes, the films were made up of a series of short animated stories linked together. The most successful example of this approach was \"Fantasia\" (which was linked together by pieces of classical music), but nowadays many people are not aware that the studio made several films of this kind. \"The Three Caballeros\", \"Make Music Mine\", \"Saludos Amigos\", \"Fun and Fancy Free\" and \"Melody Time\" are some of the other examples.Melody Time is split into seven sections. \"Once Upon A Wintertime\" deals with a loving couple who go ice-skating on a frozen river; \"Bumble Boogie\" deals with a bee which is pursued by a variety of living musical instruments to the accompaniment of Rimsky Korsakov's Flight Of The Bumblebee; \"Johnny Appleseed\" retells an old American legend about a pioneer who struck out west and planted the first apple forests; \"Little Toot\" deals with a mischievous young tugboat which redeems itself by saving a liner in a storm; \"Trees\" is a short poetic sequence in which the title tells you all you need to know; \"Blame It On The Samba\" is a simple dance sequence starring Donald Duck; and \"Pecos Bill\", which begins with real-life actors (among them Bobby Driscoll) talking around a desert campfire, and proceeds to relate the animated story of the titular Wild West character who was raised by coyotes and got into various wacky adventures.Generally-speaking, I find the longer sequences the best. The opening sequence, \"Wintertime\", is excellent, with just the right touch of comedy and excitement. \"Little Toot\" is excellent too - arguably the best episode in the film in fact. And \"Pecos Bill\" is thoroughly entertaining and has some laugh-out-loud moments. Of the longer episodes, only \"Johnny Appleseed\" feels laboured and frankly dull. The shorter episodes are actually rather disappointing. \"Bumble Boogie\" has terrific musical accompaniment, but is forgettable; \"Trees\" is pleasant but ordinary; and \"Blame It On The Samba\" looks like a rejected sequence from The Three Caballeros (1947), and is by far the most irritating sequence in this film, despite the presence of the perennially popular Donald Duck.

Up until this time, Disney had produced some amazingly good cartoons such as \"Snow White\", \"Pinocchio\" and \"Bambi\" among others. Once the war was over, the studio was a mess and they were in no shape to try to replicate their past glorious films. So, the studio worked on a wide variety of short films--intended as experimental productions and opportunities for the new animators to hone their craft. To put it bluntly, it was almost like the minor leagues of Disney--or perhaps the pre-season! Regardless, by 1946-8, they had A LOT of shorts and decided to clump them together (sometimes clumsily) and release them as full-length films, such as \"Make Mine Music\", \"Saludos Amigos\" and this film. Unfortunately, these all were wildly uneven pictures--full of very good stuff, some poor stuff and some downright awful stuff. For kids, in particular, they were second or third-rate films--often full of dull songs and varying wildly in style, content and focus.Of the collections marketed as full-length films, \"Melody Time\" might just be the most consistent of them.

And despite Disney's temporary post-war decline in quality, I challenge anyone to cite another example of animation that is so GLORIOUS and flawlessly rendered; it is a true feast for the eye, and contains some of Disney's absolutely best visual work. True, the film lacks the narrative cohesion of a single-storyline feature but---GUESS WHAT??--- that's the way the studio designed it!A few specific reactions.1.) \"Once Upon a Winter\" -- the overall design is as sumptuous and gorgeous as anything you will ever see; the studio designed this in a post-Deco visual style that was used in 1940's Christmas cards and graphics. It is stunning (the sky, the trees, the horses, the use of light and shadow, etc).I find the story a bit too crude and slapstick-y, especially where the young lady is concerned, which works against this segment's overall elegance and beauty. Frances Langford and the expert singing of the chorus are also first-rate.2.) \"Johnny Appleseed\"-- A continual marvel to look at and listen to. Gorgeous pastels, pinks, blues, apple-blossom clouds, landscapes, vistas, rivers, wind-rain-snow storms....the visual design of the pioneer's covered-wagon procession is another example of Disney's artists at their very best. And popular Irish tenor/comedian Dennis Day's virtuoso vocal performance (he portrays all of the characters) is a whimsical delight. And yes, Johnny's main song, with its graceful melody and charming whistling refrain, is happily titled \"The LORD IS GOOD TO ME\". How about THAT?!3.) \"TREES\" -- with the ever-popular Fred Waring Chorus (ever heard of them? Look 'em up. A little research might broaden my fellow reviewer's appreciation of \"Melody Time's\" appeal to audiences of its day).TREES is the \"nature/concept\" segment of the film and simply stunning in its visual design and execution. Seriously, show me anything that surpasses it in terms of its beauty. It's like a fantasy on the best parts of \"Fantasia's\" Beethoven Pastoral Symphony...but expanded and amplified.4.) I find \"Little Toot\" a bit tedious, since it's so predictable. But it's very well-done, great for the kids, and features the iconic Andrews Sisters of the '40's (ever heard of THEM?....)5.) \"BLAME IT ON THE SAMBA!!!\" --Must be seen to be believed. Donald Duck and his parrot-pal Joe Carioca in a hallucinogenic tropical-fantasy that echoes Disney's bizarre \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" from \"Dumbo\"...but in a South-American jungle-cafe setting. Totally, joyously insane...and very sophisticated in its design.The unhinged goofiness is highlighted by the combination of live-action footage of ETHEL SMITH, a popular and fabulously talented Organist of the day, who specialized in Latin Dance Music. Ethel floats in a big mojito glass, Ethel dances with our two bird-brain friends, Ethel plays the congas, Ethel gets a hot foot (with a stick of dynamite) from that crazy Aracuan bird, Ethel's organ EXPLODES, comes raining down and magically reassembles itself... Wildly imaginative and hilarious.OH YES....in case any of our reviewer colleagues are interested, \"Blame It\" also includes the fantastic singing of The DINNING SISTERS--- another popular female trio of the era, whose technical accuracy and flawless vocal blend is ANOTHER bonus in this delightful musical journey. (Incidentally, the lyrics of the song mention three Brazilian folk percussion instruments, here used as part of the \"recipe\" for the Samba: CABASA (a gourd/shaker), PANDERO (tambourine), and PUITA (a little drum with a string device that produces a curious \"groaning\" sound).6.) \"PECOS BILL\" -- with Roy Rodgers and the SONS OF THE PIONEERS, the greatest Western harmony group of all time. Check their history, should you be interested. It's good to see them together on screen and in color. And, in response to a couple of IMDb negative swipes at the two young child actors in the prologue, Luana Patten and Bobby Driscoll were among the most talented kids of the day (Bobby, especially). Read about his accomplishments and his tragic end here on IMDb; you may want to reconsider your snarky comments about his talents.Most of the PECOS BILL animated segment is pretty over-the-top in tone; it's almost off-putting, since it's characters are SO grotesque and exaggerated. However, the present-day ninnies at Disney, obsessed as they are with political-correct \"enlightenment\", chose to CENSOR the first verse of the rollicking \"Ballad of Pecos Bill\" on this DVD release---WHY? Because the animators dared to show Pecos Bill lighting a cigarette as he tames a cyclone.But all is not lost: the night-time imagery of the desert in this segment---the moon and stars, the echoing wail of coyote, etc etc, are simply STUNNING. It's hard to believe that a mere cartoon could evoke such a magical, otherworldly atmosphere.

It's virtually the same. But with one exception. Now, almost all 7 segments are longer than those from Make Mine Music. And this time, the selection of shorts are much more eclectic in variety. We have 2 American folk tales, a visual poem with words, a visual story without words, and much more.Technically, Melody Time is superior to Make Mine Music. But- not where you might expect it to be. For instance, the longer segments are, obviously, \"Johnny Appleseed\" and \"Pecos Bill.\" Of these two, \"Pecos\" is definitely better. But, even for Disney, and in the 1940's - this is just too silly to be that entertaining most of the time. You would have to be the least intelligent, most childlike person out there to find this mostly \"humorous\" segment to be that amusing. But, it has the right look and feel for Western-themed Disney animation. Then, \"Johnny\" is more serious but... there's something odd about this one, to say the least. I guess it's Disney's complete rejection of actual historical events during a sequence where the pioneers and The Indians (yep, complete with Red-faces and all) dance and eat apple bakings together. It may be \"pleasant\" if you don't want to see violent history, but it's still stupid. Then, this may not bother anyone else either, but there are a few too many references to God's work, which is too much to think about in a family-oriented cartoon. \"Prayin's for church,\" as they say.Next, is \"Little Toot,\" which for some reason doesn't strike me as that great a story. I believe it's become a favorite showing on the Disney channel between shows / movies (or, at least that's how it used to be before their new millennium Tw'een programming took over). I don't know why. It may be based entirely on the song. It's a pleasant song, but strictly for fans of old radio / big band / 1940's music.All the other segments, though, are practically perfect for what they are. The first, \"Once Upon a Wintertime,\" has some of the most magnificent colors I've ever seen in a Disney movie in a long time. For 1948, this is just pure visual delight - the blues and reds are just beyond vibrant. The tale is perhaps a little generic, but then so is most of what Disney puts to film. But that magic is there in full force on this segment. The second, is \"Bumble Boogie.\" It's short and for what it is, it's good. Not very memorable, at all. But, if you don't mind alternate versions (what we today call the \"Remix\") of popular / famous pieces of music, you might enjoy it (I certainly did).The fifth segment is \"Trees,\" and this is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever witnessed in any Disney movie. It is basically the fill-in for the Interpretive segments from Make Mine Music, only the colors are so beautiful - especially the greens, yellows, and oranges. Parts of the poem itself are a little hard to hear, but the singing mixed with these visuals is just a sight to behold. Then, the sixth, \"Blame It on the Samba,\" mostly goes for the cuteness of that trouble making bird from The Three Caballeros, the Araquan. The pitch of his voice / giggle have changed and it's now much squeakier and mousier. The animation is good, but the song is great and it's great to see Donald and his green parrot buddy return. Also returning is a live-action person added to the mix who may be a sister to the Cookie Woman from Caballeros. There's some funny chaos later on in this one.This is the first of these musical package features from Disney (post Fantasia) to have few weak parts, for which each of those have their positive attributes too. \"Johnny Appleseed\" may not be told very well, but the colors again are unbelievable in several scenes, that it makes moments of the segment uplifting.

And, this \"Melody Time\" DVD proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt.Featuring the vocal talents of such performers as Roy Rogers, The Andrews Sisters, and Bob Nolan (to name but a few) - 1948's \"Melody Time\" is a superb collection of 7 enjoyable, animated shorts whose stories are all told through song.Even though some of the story-lines of these cartoons may not appeal to some people - There can be no denying the absolute wonder and marvel of the fantastic animation-techniques that went into these works.3 of my favourites here are - Little Toot, Casey Bats Again, and Pecos Bill."], ["The best of Disney's short film collections", "Disney made a whole lot of these short film collections after the war years as a way to bide time until they got an actual feature film together. They're a mixed pack, but this one is arguably the best, if only because it contains the smallest amount of bad or boring segments.Though there certainly are a few of those here as well. Once again the segments are a gamut of musical segments mixed with actual stories. And once again the musical segments are usually the weaker ones. Like Bumble Boogie and Trees, which are mainly mood pieces. The music and poetry is nice in both, but they're as good as Fantasia's similar pieces and are there mainly for padding.Not that the story segments are all great either. Little Toot, the story about a tugboat child, is just as predictable and pandering as the story about an airplane child in Saludos Amigos. And speaking of Saludos Amigos, we get reacquainted with Jos\u00e9 in Blame It on the Samba, which is all of the worst parts of Saludos Amigos done with slightly different songs and images.But luckily we have Once Upon a Wintertime, the opening segment, a nice, soothing winter pastoral with nice animation style, cute characters and good use of music.And of course we have both The Legend of Johnny Appleseed and Pecos Bill, two of the most famous short films Disney has ever made. And they've both earned their legend. They're animated perfectly, the characters are amazing, the humour topnotch and as a whole they're just immensely entertaining.And that's Melody Time. Most segments are at the very least average, with some of them earning the moniker of classic. If you want to check out Disney's early package films, see at least this one."], ["\"Although the gag is kinda corny he brought rain from Californy.\"", "Fun Disney anthology movie that features seven musical cartoons. Most are very good and all are watchable. My least favorite is probably \"Bumble Boogie.\" Not because it's bad, it's just nothing that memorable. The ones I like the most are \"The Legend of Johnny Appleseed,\" with Dennis Day, \"Once Upon a Wintertime\" with Frances Langford, the adorable \"Little Toot,\" and \"Pecos Bill,\" a retelling of the folk hero's story introduced by a live action segment that includes Roy Rogers and Bobby Driscoll. This last segment is the one most likely to offend the PC police, both for its depictions of Indians as well as Pecos Bill smoking a cigarette. Stupid, I know, but some think we live in a time where we need others to do our thinking and decide what's best for us. The other two cartoons in this movie are \"Trees\" (the poem put to music) and a Donald Duck cartoon called \"Blame It on the Samba.\" Both are good. All of these cartoons were released later on their own as theatrical shorts. This is a very enjoyable way to pass the time. It'll put a smile on the face of any fan of old-school Disney movies.2 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Some Good, Some Boring", "In the years following Fantasia, Disney came up with some animated films which are a collection of shorts. Melody Time is one them. It contains seven unrelated musical vignettes.1. Once Upon a Winter Time: A lovey-dovey young couple go ice-skating and there they have a cutesy misunderstanding but make up cutesy-ly in the end. As though this doesn't ooze enough icky cuteness, there is a rabbit couple imitating the human couple. A poor beginning.2. Bumble Boogie: The movie starts getting good. This is Disney's take on Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" and a very interesting one too. If anything it ends too soon.3. Johnny Appleseed: A romanticized story of Johnny Appleseed, a real- life, pioneer apple-cultivator, this short has some of the best animation in any Disney movie.4. Little Toot: The good run continues with the story of a naughty little tugboat who eventually learns to be responsible.5. Trees: A short, totally forgettable song on how trees shelter animals and birds.6. Blame it on the Samba: Donald Duck and Jose Carioca dance to some Samba music played on piano by Ethel. It has some interesting animation but nothing special.7. Pecos Bill: This is the longest feature and has a live-action sequence. It tells the tale of the folklore hero, Pecos Bill and it is really enjoyable.Watch the better shorts separately rather than the entire movie."], ["A real treat for the younger set", "Disney or at least his collaborators must really have known how to entertain and educate the lower elementary level children of America. While substituting for grades k-3, I chose from a shelf of videos made available by the music teacher as noted in her lesson plans. I chose \"Melody Time\" because it was by Disney and because it contained \"The Flight of the Bumblebee,\" which I knew should delight everyone. I only had time to show the first four segments of the movie, but the children really enjoyed it. They seemed fascinated by the Bee being chased by the piano keys, first in the form of a serpent and then broken into individual keys. Even though I found the \"Johnny Appleseed\" segment a bit hard to digest, the children loved it too. I later watched the rest of the movie at home and I'm sure the kids would have been entranced by the other stories as well. So even though grownups may find \"Melody Time\" a bit less rewarding than say \"Fantasia,\" believe me the younger set will love it.2 out of 4 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Lame!", "Throughout the 40's, Walt had a great problems with staff and money issues thanks to the Second World War and had to produce cheap films containing short stories. But most of them were good like \"Saludos Amigos\" (1943), \"The Three Caballeros\" (1945) and \"Make Mine Music\" (1946). \"Fun and Fancy Free\" (1947) proved that the gloss was starting to wear off but still provided good entertainment but with \"Melody Time\" (1948), you could tell that the studio was starting to head into trouble! I afraid this is lame, boring, clich\u00e9d, over-used and dweary. It starts yet again with Donald Duck (he's a very great character most of the time but let's just face it: back in the late 1940's he was just been over-exposed! It's now just overkill!) starting with a silly dance with will give nobody any pleasure or interest whatsoever. Then it all turns into a bunch of flat stories which tries hard to recapture the charm and the wit the Three Caballeros had but fails miserably. One or two of the shorts are worth watching but overall, they boring and same-old! No even an appearance from Jose Carioca, possibly one of Walt's best characters from the 40's could save this one! If you are a Disney enthusiast and wants to wonder all of Walt's work than this will do but for everybody else DON'T BOTHER because they is so much better other Disney films out there (like \"Lady and the Tramp\" and \"The Sword in the Stone\"). I'm sad to break it to Walt with all his financial problems at the time but this truly does suck!2/10"], ["Old Disney is not for everyone", "The Bad:This is a compilation of shorts, not a cohesive story. Some of the shorts are fun, but some are pretty bad. The short \"Blame it on the Samba\" - in which Donald dances around while a live-action woman sings and plays instruments \u2013 made me try to fast-forward through the never-ending scene. I strongly disliked that one. Although someone who is a fan of that style of music might find it more palatable. \"Pecos Bill\" contains Indian stereotypes which are outdated and potentially offensive, along with a depiction of the hero smoking.The Good:I really loved the \"Johnny Appleseed\" segment. It's loosely based on a true story (hey, history education!), plus had an unexpectedly positive view of Christianity (in something like two lines). The \"Little Toot\" segment was also pretty cute. The handful of other segments were fairly forgettable in my opinion, but not unwatchable.The Mom view:Created after Fantasia, it feels like it is a much lesser cousin \u2013 or even simply a grouping of completely unrelated shorts rather than a harmonious concert experience. Since the music can be so varied (and not contemporary), I find this could be educational for a child. Exposure to music style that a parent doesn't regularly listen to can be a very good thing. Also, the American folk hero aspect of this compilation was nice. If I could snip out the segments I liked and discard the irritating ones, this would make for an okay movie for my kids, but the \"Samba\" segment simply kills this for me. I'll get Fantasia instead."], ["A stupid, dumb and totally dead follow-up to \"Fantasia\"", "I was so let down by the lifelessness of \"Melody Time\" when I first saw it. I went on holiday in 2000 and I went to a video shop and I chose it over \"Make Mine Music\" and \"Saludo Amigos\". This is possibly the stupidest feature-film ever made by Walt Disney. If you think about it, \"Fantasia\", a stunningly beautiful masterpiece, was first released in 1940 and \"Melody Time\" debuted in 1948 and I seriously would expect to see a decent amount of progress in eight years! Here are the segments in \"Melody Time\" which all will never stand against \"Fantasia\": ONCE UPON A WINTERTIME: A man and a woman go ice-skating and just because he trips her up unintentionally she rejects him and the same happens to a man rabbit and a woman rabbit - just plain stupidity, if you ask me! BUMBLE BOOGIE: A constantly irritating version of \"Flight of the Bumble Bee\" is performed here. JOHNNY APPLESEED: The holy spirit is not here at all, even though Johnny Appleseed is a holy man, and his guardian angel is no holy ghost either. LITTLE TOOT: is a young tug-boat who is arrested just for trying to help out which may distress a few people. TREES: A lifeless follow-up to \"Bambi\" BLAME IT ON THE SAMBA: Donald Duck and his parrot-friend Joe Carioca go to a caf\u00e9 and find themselves inside the glass cup of water they had been drinking and that, perhaps is the only slightly interesting thing about \"Melody Time\" but then a very silly song and dance takes place. PECOS BILL: I think I perhaps like this one because it kind of takes me to how it was in the Wild West in the 1800s sometime. Over all, this film is just dead, dead, dead almost all the way through it. I advise you to never reject \"Fantasia\" for this. It's BORING!"], ["Melody Time", "When you think of classic Disney films, this is perhaps one that does not come to mind. Melody Time is essentially a series of shorts put together to make up a narrative feature. As you might expect, it is a hit and miss show. It's not that it's bad per-se, it's just that when the company that made this, also made Fantasia, Beauty and the Beast and Pinocchio, you can see why it doesn't hold up.As usual, the animation is superb. Animation wise, there is nothing to fault. At times, it feels like visual poetry. But sometimes, the content falls short of what could be an interesting film. The good includes 'The Legend of Johnny Appleseed', a gorgeous look at one of America's first pioneers, and 'Pecos Bill', a country and western jamboree about an impossibly adventurous cowboy. Both of these segments remind us that Disney is at their shorts best, when they are focused on folkloric tales. See Icabod and Mr Toad for further proof.However, it's not all fun and games. One segment, 'Little Toot' was so abysmal that it made me yearning for the blandness of the kids TV show, 'Tugs'. And 'Blame it on the Samba', featuring the most irritating Disney character ever committed to celluloid, The Aracuan Bird. There also seems to be this constant idea in the segment which says that the Samba music is impossible not to dance to. I know a lot has changed since 1948, but did I miss a meeting where it was agreed that this music was supposed to be intoxicating? The other segments full under the radar. 'Trees' in particular felt only about 1 minute long, which is a shame because the animation in the that is the best of the film.The original title of Melody Time was 'All is Fun'. After seeing the film, you can see why they changed the title. But it doesn't mean there is no fun to be had along the way."], ["Enjoyable, but extremely forgettable", "This film is quite entertaining, the animation looks good and the live action scenes aren't too bad, however, the only thing I can remember about this movie is the Donald duck is in it.

It contains seven animated shorts, some with just music and some with dialog and music.You won't find much plot in this film - just a bunch of cartoon shorts set to the music of contemporary oldies and songs sung by singers from the Golden Era. The animation looks pretty washed up and the overall movie misses the rich music, dynamic and scenic animation sequences and the excitement and majesty Fantasia was able to present.While each segment wasn't very appealing, the Johnny Appleseed sequence was a little touching and the Trees segment was quite beautiful. The story of Little Toot was too \"cute\" but has some heroic elements, and the Blame it on the Samba sequence was quite catchy with its Latin music (and it's nice to see a familiar face, Donald Duck, star in that sequence). However, the Once Upon A Wintertime short was boring, Bumble Boogie was a little too mindless and the Pecos Bill story, while set to some good ol' American flavor, dragged the film.Overall, the film doesn't have much that would grab your attention and has that all-around lazy feel to it. It might be something that is OK for adults to watch once to pass the time, but children might not be able to sit through it.Grade D+"], ["Good Cartoon Anthology", "Melody Time a successor to Walt Disney's Make Mine Music didn't quite reach the standards of the previous film, but it still has a lot to recommend it.

Clark was one of the best singers of the Thirties and Forties, his was a great law to American popular music.Pecos Bill the final segment proved so popular that it got issued as a short subject feature. But I like Dennis Day in the Johnny Appleseed segment. Also Donald Duck and Jose Carioca doing the Blame It On The Samba dancing to the music the Andrews Sisters sing and that Ethel Smith plays on the Organ.

The Pecos Bill short is best remembered as having Roy Rogers and Trigger in the live action sequences. Then there's Blame it on the Samba; with Donald Duck, Panchito and Joe Carioca making an appearance after their own film, The Three Caballeroes.The music is old fashioned by today's standards for a new audience, but delve in and culture yourself.

That's when it was on Wednesday nights, not Sundays, and in black and white. Johnny Appleseed and Pecos Bill were the two most repeated segments on television because of the popularity of their characters. Dennis Day of course was well known to youngsters because of his appearance on the Jack Benny show and of course Roy Rogers was the top western star in 1948 when the movie was released. Even today, my favorite part of the program is the song, \"Blue Shadows on the Trail.\" Make Mine Music had the classic Casey at the Bat,as told by Jerry Colonna, whom even though you may never have heard of him, brings laughs at his narration. The other character to come from Make Mine Music was Bongo, the circus bear. There were Bongo story books and of course records.
