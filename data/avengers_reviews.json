{"Avengers: Infinity War": ["This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.", "This film is way better than endgame!\nThe actions better\nThe writings better\nThe dialogues better\nThe cgi is better\nMore shocks and more emotional.\nWatching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.\nI just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!\nBut trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations.  I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas.  I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony.  I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.", "This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel's masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just \"world domination.\" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.", "Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks.  And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible.  But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters. The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe.  From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it.  That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts. And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, \"We don't trade lives\", even when giving up one could save billions.  There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling.  For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight.  Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe. In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero m\u00eal\u00e9e that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it. Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.", "Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like \"epic\", \"spectacle\", and \"smash\" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.\nThe summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nWhen Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.\nWith The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.\nNaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.\nWhat really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.\nThere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.\nI was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.\nBelieve the hype, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.\n5 stars out of 5", "I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.", "Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields.  Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations. Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips.  There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its \"baggy\" or \"overlong\" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.", "All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous! There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one. So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.", "With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. \nWhat I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! \nMARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!", "I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they're superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made.  Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn't go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos.  The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait. That eerie \"Thanos will return\" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can't wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie. +Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)\n+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film\n+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)\n+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years\n+Incredible performances\n+Phenomenal original score \nEtc.  Not much you can find that's wrong with this movie. It's literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn't have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn't mean it didn't have an ending.  My Rating: 10/10", "Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. \nSo let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). \nNow, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. \nAnd of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. \nI cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come.  I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.", "I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts. I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions. Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox. Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it's just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he's alive. Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal. And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale. Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I've been waiting for for 3 years. Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9.", "Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness. Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers. Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache. With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never. Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent. As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would. Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless. I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies. Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film. Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man? The Good: Children of Thanos Thanos All out action as expected Ties everything together nicely The Bad: Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that) So many characters were spread too thin Things I Learnt From This Movie: If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weird Dishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened. Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film", "Well, Well, Well.... I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on... Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under \"popcorn film\" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either. The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time. The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that. The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like \"Oceans 28\" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.", "Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off... Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable.  The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of \"death\" because of it. In this movie there was death, and \"death\". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now \"death\" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them.  My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it.  Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves.  9.8/10", "This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of \"everything is gonna be alright\" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I'm definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.", "I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long.  It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who \"died\" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap.  From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better.  OVERALL: \"Avengers: Infinity War\" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie. 6.5 out of 10.", "This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain: Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.   Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans.  The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases: Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. \nStar-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy.  Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot.  Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want? Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene.  Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense.  Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie.  Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description: New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle. Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower. Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed. I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth.  Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable. Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.", "The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.", "Just WOW , The Russo nailed it, hand down from me they did it again. Part by part is interesting to watch , some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones.  One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it. Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it . Of course every good movie always have some issue with it but just MINOR issue can close eye and let it go. Going to watch it again soon . Love from Malaysia.", "Just neglect the so called reviews.Its personal views and differs from person to person.Make your own review and keep it to yourself.", "Without a doubt the most complete cinematic experience I've had since The Dark Knight in 2008, only on a much grander scale. A phenomenal acheivement by everyone involved.", "DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE! This is an amazing movie! One of the best openings in the MCU! People keep saying there is no story to this movie in which case they are incredibly stupid as this movie follows the story of the infinity gauntlet comics from the 1990's where Thanos takes all the infinity stones from the Avengers heroes and eliminates half of all life in the universe which is exactly happens in this movie as it is a part 1 of 2 story! This is the defeat and part 2 is the victory that's how this is set up so don't go into this movie expecting anything like character development or a more fleshed out world just expect WAR! A massive fight across worlds where our heroes try to stop Thanos and fail. In my own personal opinion this is a masterpiece for 3 reasons 1.) all these characters combining into 1 big massive team is done incredibly well (2.) we have seen easily the greatest marvel movie villain ever for the first time in action and finally (3.) this is easily the most fun and emotional Experience I've had with a marvel movie since the first Avengers movie! A solid 10/10 for me and hopefully more people after me!", "Foreword: I was dragged to watch this film.  Disney are trying to hard. Trying to hard to cram superficial pop culture references into every 5 minutes of \"dialogue\". Trying too hard to take a tongue-in-cheek, meta approach to tired superhero movie cliches, like that makes them any better. Now they're giving us an predictably unpredictable ending to a mediocre procession of cliche, angsty superheroes. Disney have utterly destroyed modern mainstream cinema.", "Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years. Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power. Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene. I rate it a solid 9/10", "Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good. The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway. There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone \"for balance\" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah. Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around. I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.", "I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War.  Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic clich\u00e9 formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the \"characters\" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and clich\u00e9  There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not. I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.", "The movie has some entertainment value, but don't believe the hype and think you're going to see an intelligent or coherent plot, something innovative, or even something you haven't seen before.  Disney/Marvel is riding the wave and releasing movie after movie (rightfully so) to get as much profit while the craze lasts. There's not much differentiating this Avengers movie from the other Marvel movies.", "Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys!\nThanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who\nwas the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.\nI mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for\neveryone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by \nkilling to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, \nwe've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills \nhammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.\nThese writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them\nwhat they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are\nbetter than the original creators which they are not by any means! For me it's getting to the point where I don't really care if I see these films anymore, they just let me down every time, where these writers don't do the proper research\nand just create it in their own way. The comic fans made the comics a success, without us over the years, there would be no films, so maybe you should try to please the\nfans before the random cinema goers? Bits that really annoy me, no Lady Death or any celestial power beings of any kind, Red skull appears on the planet galaxies away to Thanos about the sould gem, great writing\nthere, true to the comics, NOT! Boy that sucked, I thought, why is this not at least Mephisto here or Lady Death, Red Skull, it's so bad I want to cry.\nThe Hulk was not really in the film, just the first few minutes, they just wanted to give the actor face time, so just had him jumping around in the Hulk buster outfit, yawn! This film is an insult to The Infinity Gauntlet Comics, go and read Thanos Quest, then The Infinity Gauntlet 1-6 and wait for this on normal TV. Totally ruined one of my favorite story lines, these writers need to get over themselves and not write it as if they think it's their creation, it's not! Best bit in the film for me, was Stan Lee's cameo! 5/10 but should have been an easy 10.", "This film is disappointing, at best. Its plot is a series of battle set-pieces, in which a cast overstuffed with hero figures engage in pointless fights with an unbeatable enemy. The dialogue is throwaway, the scenes of human interaction brief and trivial, and the moral seems to be \"you can't win\". The ending is particularly offensive, because it violates the prime rule of narrative-- providing the viewer with a sense of closure. At the end (almost) everybody dies and then. . .The End. Tiresome, overwrought, and banal", "We occasionally use IMDB to judge whether a film is worth watching at our local Odeon. Generally, that works well but a score of 8.9 for this film (currently) is hugely misleading IMHO.  This is clearly a film that polarizes audiences - those who have bought into the Marvel franchise and have watched every previous film (31 apparently) mostly love it; those (like us) who have watched a few here and there seem to be disappointed / puzzled / bored. For a non-fan there are a couple of major issues: Too many characters and too much back story that we can't remember or never knew. The fights seemed rather perfunctory and, I know it's the fashion these days, but the shortness of each shot (a second? half a second between cuts?) makes them impossible to follow.  One positive reviewer has criticised low scorers saying it's like watching the last 2 minutes of an hour-long drama and expecting to understand it. I think that's unfair. Surely a film should make sense in and of itself - I wasn't charged less to watch this one, so surely I should be able to enjoy it on some level? For the record, we recently went to see Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther and enjoyed them both (particularly the last one). Which I guess brings us back to where we started... redressing the balance of that crazy 8.9 score. No, this film is NOT better than Apocalypse Now (8.5) or The Terminator (8.0) or Citizen Kane (8.4) or Taxi Driver (8.3) or Raging Bull (8.2)... that's just crazy! My honest advice: If you like Marvel, you'll probably love this; if you're not a big fan, save your money for something else.", "Whole movies feels rushed . Most of the time fight starts --> fight ends and Thanos gets the stone lets move to next stone .\nrushed story elements.\nsub par action sequences .\nmost of the important actions sequences are not even present in the movie.\n( fight sequence to get power stone , fight sequence when they capture thor, fight sequence on nowhere ........) it felt like fast forwarding through whole movie.  well they ruined the joy of infinity war. too disappointed \nlets hope infinity war get a remake its deserve in future.( and by the time they do lets hope i forget this disappointment)\nstory in the movie could have easily divided into 2 parts", "This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were. One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story. Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff.... ...ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe. In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like \"his glove lost the power after he used it\" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid. I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel. The effects and sound were decent though.", "Merely 5% is real life images, the rest were virtual. The story unconnected, boring, the end surprisingly unended, to be continued... it doesn't deserve the 9 star rating, who paid it?", "Keep in mind that just because s movie makes billions, that does not make it a good movie. Like most of Marvel movies this is an insipid mess. The entire plot took 10 years to develop and is summed up in this latest entry in 4 or 5 sentences. Acting isn't necessary or required, just grimace and look sweaty and vacant. Meanwhile we'll fill the screen with 50,000 CGI lights and explosions and convince you what is happening matters. Well it doesn't.", "I really liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Likewise Iron Man & The Avengers. But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects. It drives me nuts anymore, when fighting takes a 5 minute 'time out' for a lame, \"poignant\" dialog scene. I guess that I've seen too many of these to enjoy them anymore.", "Unfortunately, computer-generated mayhem is much more important than character development.  One-liners is not good writing. There was such hope with the Dr. Strange movie and nice writing....but this \"Avengers\" film does nothing to add to any of the previous characters' story lines...especially Dr. Strange.  It's a jumble, with explosions/death/violence...with little use or reasoning behind it's constant grinding noise.  All the tears shed by actors, had no heart behind it.  It's sad when money drives a movie rather than writing.  Just because something owns Lucas Industrial Light and Magic, doesn't mean it has to be on screen at all times. I thought SE was supposed to be light-seasoning...not complete coverage. The offering lacks in so many ways.  Sad...had high hopes.", "This was crap to be honest. \nIt had some good action but made no logical sense! A good movie must make good sense.  First, Hulk is so toned down that Thanos didn't even employ any of the stones to beat him! In less than a minute he knocks Hulk out! \"We have a Hulk\" is so meaningless right now. Then Banner is forced into and kept in an iron man suit. Agrhhhh!  Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan? Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls.  Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated! Probably should have been called - Avengers: Thanos the powerful. Waste of 2+ hrs for me.", "I am not a comics specialist and unlike most of the others I have no emotional connection to any of the hereos... so I might be biased. I have never expected much of a story line or intrigue from a movie solely based on the heroes presence, but being recommended as a revolutionary and number one of the series I hoped for at least a bit of cheap humor and great pictures. Yet, in the movie I've laughed twice, first time when Thor called raccoon a rabbit, and second time... when he did it again. The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects. There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights. Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.", "Oh man... I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, and so bitterly disappointed when it was done. It might not be the dumbest story I've ever been subjected to, but it sure tried hard. First off, the CGI was magnificent. Most of the cast weren't actually there when they filmed this, and yet you believe. It all looks so real, and when you have a scene with CGI Kroot, CGI Rocket and a CGI background, and everyone looks real and has emotions, it's staggering. Absolutely hands-down the best movie I've ever seen in this regard. Now let's talk about that story. Spoilers from hereon in. Hey, how about that scene where Wong cuts off Cull Obsidian's left forearm with a portal?\nHey, what about Cull Obsidian tearing off the left forearm of the Hulkbuster suit?\nHow about that scene where Groot cuts off his own left forearm to form the handle of Stormbreaker? Are we seeing a pattern here? What to do about a bad guy who wears the ultimate weapon on his left forearm? Ooooh, I wonder. And Thor with that spanky new AXE and all... Not to mention the master of the time stone choosing not to use it at any time in the movie to make it all better. Yeah, yeah, yeah, halfway through he looks into the future and sees only one way to win (assertion with no evidence) but he doesn't even try earlier? Dumb. Disappointingly dumb. Fantastic dialogue throughout. Clever moves from Thanos's guys in Wakanda, and some amazing fight scenes. But that story... And the second Black Panther (with another movie in the works), Spider-Man (with another movie in the works) and the Guardians (say it with me) start to wink out, you KNOW it isn't going to stick. And Part 2 will involve some form of travelling back in time to undo it all. Good grief.", "Sometimes in this life there are things beyond criticism, the Mona Liza for example or Turners rain steam and speed or Chaplin in The Kid.

So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age. Telephones i believe are sold this way, at least this is how i see the commercial world of now. Now, i know my views are in total opposition to the frankly ridiculous high score's on this web site, and please don't think i am not grateful, my local multiplex needs big profit films to survive and hopefully prosper so the likes of me can see proper films that are real cinematic experiences but make next to no money, usually that's the fate of most superior films these day's! \nCan i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray. Did i enjoy it? in any way, well no, just too much of a good thing, i like sugar in my tea, but 32 spoons is to much! This i will call it for ease, a film, it just had too much of everything. Now, i can just imagine steam boiling over from most readers that i am clearly to old and out of touch, but i argue not so, the trailer for Deadpool 2 was so funny and inventive that i am eagerly awaiting this release. As for all these many many super hero's to numerous to remember and to numerous to mention, i do have a question for superhero's obviously adoring public the question is, are the comic books any better?", "(mild spoilers ahead) The movie is designed to appeal the viewers by the familiarity the audience has with the cast from all the previous installments. There are some humorous dialogues that are funny, which makes the movie deserve my second star.  The effects are of course top notch, and one has to commend the technical aspect. \n \nOther than that, there is no logic whatsoever in the movie. Every exaggeration from the past has now been multiplied by a thousand. The plot could be summarized in a couple lines, with room to spare.

Ninja-Turtles kind of movie. Stupid jokes, no plot, non-sense whatsoever. At least, when I was a child, films used to make if only a bit of sense; not any more for milennials, it seems. New world, new styles, very little brain. Pity...", "I have seen them all (I think) and this one was hard to hollow. I didn't know who most of the non AVENGER characters were. Like the 'rabbit\" for instance and his whole crew. THOR didn't look like THOR. Captain America looked like Dr. Strange and the HULK couldn't get it up through out the whole movie. This looked more like a STAR WARS movie than an AVENGER movie, and I haven't cared about a STAR WARS movie since 1980 something.. The special effects were very special but for much of the two and a half hours I had a tough time following what was going on. I like to go see pictures to be entertained and not be tested.", "SPOILER ALERT!!\nI am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat.  Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still... The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea.  Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing. This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors. The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that.  I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right? I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.", "The 10/10's just go to show how shallow general audiences have become!! Far from a masterpiece... lots of camera shaking, too many characters, sensational garbage. Jam packing every single marvel hero into 1 film and an ending that is far from 'deep' and just forces you to watch the next installment to make sense of it. 3 stars and that's generous!", "I'm hoping they can pull it back on the right track with the sequel.", "While Avengers Infinity War has some cool action and funny lines, its many death scenes of beloved characters including scenes of characters in pure agony can make this movie very challenging. This is emphasized due to the fact that not all characters will come back and that the characters are popular and well known by many. Add to the fact that the story can be unpredictable and a few tonal shifts, such as an emotional scene suddenly cutting to Tony Stark and co. cracking jokes and one- liners, and you got a movie that's overall not worth watching again.", "If you get your thrills watching the Avengers get their butt kicked, seeing at least two die, and enjoy the villian being the star of an entire movie, this film is for you! Plus throw in an almost non existent Hulk, a Thor with no hammer (he does get an axe towards the end of the movie), Captain America with a kids toy shield and no mask, and a basically worthless Vision, we'll, you get it.  I know this a two-parter and a lot of what happened will be rectified, but it was still a huge disappointment to me. Did enjoy some of the hero pairings and the humor was mostly funny, but it wasn't nearly enough for me.", "Warning: spoilers. There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.\nInfinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart. First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the \"end result\"?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you. Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes... For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage! Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.", "When you take 16 movies to build to one - remember to tell the actual history. You can't get to the apex of 16 movies, forget what you said, disconnect the dots, throw all the characters in and call it an epic. You really need a connected story. A team isn't a team when there's no tactics, no strategy, and no unified goal. With the amount of money spent making these films give a little money to the story tellers.", "Really? A super hero epic in which the villain wins, kills half the Universe, and The End? \nWords cannot express my disappointment in wasting these 2.5 hours. Excuse me while I scatter into dust.", "I was waiting for this for a long time but I have slept during the film... The animations, effects were pretty good but unfortunetly It was boring. I am not sure If I want to watch it again.", "Nothing but cheesy comedy and a predictable ending. This is getting way to over hyped by the fan boys. We know none of the characters are dead because marvel has 27 sequels planed for each character. It's basically a trailer for the next one. If you've seen the trailers you already know what happens. Don't watch.", "Awesome visuals and CGI, but this is not 1990s. Terminator 2 was awesome back then. Now CGI just does not impress anymore. That's Michael Bay territory, and this movie sure looks like that - awesome CGI and dumb plot. Character and plot wise, I just want to say that I am sick of heroes and villains having their abilities appear or vanish from one scene to another just to justify the plot. Not to talk about stupid character decisions that completely change the plot... It takes away from the soul of the story which becomes simple, forced and artificial. SPOILER: Just one example for abilities (but the movie is full of it): in one scene Thanos beats the pulp out of Hulk, but in the rest of the movie all the other heroes receive punches from him like it's nothing. And one example of stupidity: Quill becomes responsible for the grim ending by saving Thanos in the last second, as Thanos was on the verge of being stripped of its powers. I expected more...", "The director has just spaffed action scenes in one after the other in a confusing non-chronological order.\nAnyone who knows Marvel will expect more and anyone who doesn't will be confused.", "*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead ***  Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. \nThe acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land.  The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense. Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint. The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. \nThe music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure) The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was \"designed by comittee\". The boardroom idea seems to have been: \"Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop\". \nProblem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter. After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.", "This was an awful movie! pretentious and trying too hard.. no plot, no story developement.. mediocre acting performances!!! One of the leading actresses used to work for website videforex.tk as a model and account manager, how can she end up in a A-list movie?  The first avengers was quite original. But this one!!! I was excpecting it to be way better. I spent more time thinking about how cold the theater was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie LOL. Seems Hollywood is now a CGI puppet for making superheros movies that shouldn't be made in the first place. If they keep making movies like this one people will start watching the 50' titles again. Just my cents.", "The ending ruined literally everything about the movie, they shouldn't split it from the next movie that fixes everything, the ending shouls have been the start of the next movie, it should have ended when thanos traveled back to seeing his daughter still young.", "I've watched every MCU movie at least twice. I love them all, even Iron Man 2, but this was terribly disappointing. This whole thing gave me the impression that the writers watched a lot of Game of Thrones and thought: \"I know what people like, let's kill a bunch of heroes!\" Even if the fight scenes devolved to the absurd, it didn't matter, we had good guys dying, so this would be a win. Now obviously it's a comic book movie, so it's a safe bet that most if not all of the heros they killed will somehow miraculously be resurrected, but that's not the point. I just paid \u00a312 to watch characters I fell in love with get murdered for 2 hours only to have it wrap up with half of everyone dying. Now I get to wait an entire year to find out how they're going to fix it. If I wanted to get punched in the stomach, I'm sure I could find someone to do it for less than \u00a312 and 2 hours of my time.", "Hated Star Lord from start to finish, Way too many characters to follow, Way too many storylines happening at once, The characters that died (minus Loki and Heimdall who I cried over) I didnt feel sad over because we only seen them in a few movies and didnt know them that well. For some reason all the phase one characters didnt die it would have made more sense if they died.", "Two and half hours later, I walk out after watching the, what I thought was the closing credits only to now read about there being more of the movie, following the rollout of the credits. As to the movie itself, a jumbled mess, some confusing CGI and more characters that you can poke a stick at. All up, probably should have waited until released on Foxtel or Netflix.", "If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. \nAt the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END!\nThis means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers. All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big \"idiotic\" bam.\nThe Avengers: Infinity War is the first half.  I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure. Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy. PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?", "The rating of 10 are obviously people under the age of 18 or extreme fans of Marvel. This is not even the best Marvel movie this year(Black Panther had better story & drama), definitely nowhere near 'best superhero movie ever'. The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence. For the record, I loved Avengers, loved Winter Soldier so it is not like I cannot enjoy a superhero flick. This one is not(unless you are a fanboy(girl).", "Infinity War is a astonishing film which serves as the culmination of everything that occurred in MCU since the first pictures. Would seem, the movie had to turn out obscure and overloaded, but screenwriters so skillfully bring one moment to another that the movie bewitches with the first until the last minute. \"War\" connects those who didn't know about existence of each other, divides the teams which developed in the past, transfers characters from one region of the Galaxy in another, accompanying everything with grandiose battles. At the same time the narration remains clear and fascinating. Of course, if you've watched the previous movies. It's not a movie for those who want to get acquainted with Captain America, Thor, Hulk and other famous characters. The film is shot for fans, and the better you know the MCU story, the you derive bigger pleasure from viewing.", "Maybe I'm just sick of superhero movies. But I found myself bored and so sick of the mindless violence in this film that really just lacks a good strong story at its core. \nSuperhero movies have overstayed their welcome for me. This is the last one I'll go to see I'm done.", "Avengers (first part) were far better than this, and MCU legacy will carry on \"Coming back from dead\"", "Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.", "The comedy was good. The ending was good awfully depressing. Don't take kids it's little to Gorey and seeing almost everyone die. Is not a good thing for kids.", "This movie is shockingly bad, especially compared with the other avengers films, and is the absolute worst Marvel movie ever made. Almost as bad as the Batman vs. Superman movie was for the DC universe.  Fair warning, this review is all spoilers - not that it really matters since you shouldn't see the film anyway. I saw the film today and I can't help but conclude that the writers of this film were just lazy. For shame! I get that Infinity War is supposed to be the first part of a two-parter, so pretty much all the good guys had to die. But there are ways of making good guys lose without having them act like lobotomy patients throughout the whole story and literally die from stupidity every step of the way (oh, except for Spiderman who is inexplicably the only intelligent character in the story). In what ways were the good guys unbelievably dumb every step of the way, you ask? I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you what some better written alternatives could have been. This is just from memory, so there are probably more instances of bad writing that I've forgotten. 1. Loki gives up a stone to save Thor, even though it may be possible to resurrect him later and Loki knows half the universe will die as an eventual result. 2. Loki goes after the more-powerful-than-gods Thanos a moment later with a knife. An effing knife! 3. The first thing Dr. Strange does is as Ironman for help. Whaa? 4. Dr. Strange gets tangled up in weeds and faints, then to be carried off like a swooned and helpless fairytale maiden. 5. Gamora attacks Thanos first, by herself, even though she knows she alone holds the key to a stone. 6. Gamora gives up the final stone to relieve her sister from momentary torture, knowing that half of all life in the universe will die as a result. 7. Wakanda opens its forcefield, and the super-duper powerful lady stops guarding the last stone in order to fight. 8. Star Lord prevents the other good guys from removing the infinity stone holder from Thanos by deliberately saving Thanos from the mind control lady. 9. Ironman didn't punch Star Lord's lights out when he saw that he was getting ready to do something moronic. 10. Neither did Dr. Strange. 11. Thor stabs the Thanos through the chest with a super-axe (which was obviously stupid in the first place, but even then he has time to pull it back out and chop off the baddy's head), and instead the baddy says \"You should have gone for the head\" and sucks himself into a portal to escape. 12. Last, and least important but still annoying, the Hulk is effectively impotent for no good reason. Here are 3 Possible solutions off the top of my head that would have been less poorly written: 1. Dr. Strange is distracted by something even more important for the entire movie, so that the other heroes can die tragically, and in the second movie he stops being too busy and just rolls back time and undoes Thanos' acquisition of the stones - also causing the heroes to not die. 2. Same thing, except Dr. Strange or his compatriot could have opened up and closed one of their portal thingies to snip off Thanos' arm with the stones on it. 3. Thor could have died trying to make the super-axe, or he could have cut off Thanos' head and someone else evil could quickly put on the stone-holding glove thing instead. Either way would have been an improvement.", "I know what comes next.......Thor wakes up and he's in a shower and none of this actually happened!!!! ....and Thanos only kills off 1/2 of all living beings..too bad...I was hoping Thanos would kill off everyone (including the Bus Driver) and we'd be done with this dribble. Probably won't happen....I can dream however....and I won't bother with going to the movies for AVENGERS: Thors Shower.........and I can't wait for Thanos to become a 'good guy'........plot makes less sense then a bugs bunny cartoon...I give the dribble factor a 9........", "What. A. Waste.  No plot. Terrible movie. Super long", "I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular. However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly.  At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before.  I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.", "Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it.\nWell, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.\nNote that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...\nSo I'll go now, I have some work to do tonight to try and digest this nuclear pizza....", "This is an incomplete film. Thanos is collecting the 6 gem stones, which can magically do anything for the possessor. The Avengers, Guardians and anyone else you can think of are out to stop him. That is the entire crux of the film.\n Thanos' motivation is that he wants to eliminate half of the universe's population under the notion that it will somehow cure poverty and starvation. This premise is asinine, however. Earth was half of it's current population a mere 50 years ago, and poverty and starvation was an even bigger problem at the time, than it is today. If he really was concerned with the ratio between life and natural resources, why not increase the amount of resources? Either way you look at it, the motivation was incredibly asinine and poorly thought out. Regardless, that's Thanos' master plan and the heroes aim to stop him. From the very beginning, however, they fail miserably. By movie's end, Thanos has won; he has all of the gems and half of the universe is dead, including all of Asgard and at least half of our heroes. The End. Seriously, that's the end. \n Now most folks recognize that the carnage and death in this film will be undone in the next movie. Dr. Strange likely cast a spell on his gem that will start mucking about with time and reality and they will somehow make things right again in time for those Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy sequels. But that's a completely different film and that just belies the significance of this film even further, Films should stand on their own. Infinity War doesn't do that. If you get off seeing the heroes getting their asses kicked and dying while the bad guy wins at the end; then this is the film for you. I think that's the sort of story that would only appeal to someone who enjoys tearing the wings off flies.", "I thought this movie was pathetic. Thor has no Hammer, and forges an axe? Are you serious? The Hulk grapples with Thanos and is overpowered to the point where he is afraid to come out through Banner? Are you serious? Where is CA? He lost his razor AND his shield? Are you serious? Most of the things I expect from the Avengers were absent in this film. There was very little working together to defeat a Foe; and way too much about the Bad Guy -- Thanos. Like, why do I care? Thanos is the Bad Guy, so defeat him and move on! Then the Ending --- utterly pathetic!", "Of all the millions of dollars spent on the CGI and the big name actors, someone forgot to hire a decent scriptwriter.\n \nThe plot was so full of holes I could imagine it looking like Sponge Bob.  The attempt to make Thanos as the anti-hero was feeble and the backstory of the love for a daughter held no ground.  All the heroes never used their powers the way we have seen them in previous Marvel movies, thereby conveniently handing ALL the stones to Thanos on a silver platter. AND setting up the scene for the next movie.... It's bewildering and frustrating that only Thanos knows how to use the stones' power, despite having only gained them for the first time. Yet their previous wielders only knew how to flaunt it in front of him/his henchmen and then easily giving them away.  The only reason I gave another point to the 1 I originally planned to give was because Spidey used an Alien reference... I really do want my money and 2.5 hours of my life back...", "...every single frame has so many things... But the story is absolutely lacking, everything seems to happen completely by chance, characters are inconsistent with their comics' or previous MCU movies' personae.\nThanos is immobilized about to be deprived of his gauntlet (why not cutting off his arm, I wonder?) but Mr.Moron Startlord Quill (I don't recall him being such a moron in the Guardians saga) messes all up, Dr.Strange refusing to use the gem of Time and then giving it away becuse, you know, saving Stark is worth sacrificing the entire universe.\nAnd why Thanos is battling at all? After he manages to get hold of the gem of Reality he can just tell atoms, quarks, strings to do whatever he wants, wiping his enemies away by snapping his fingers: he even throws a moon at Iron Man, why not just decompose him and transform him into cardboard?

The 8.9 rating proves that IMDb is irrelevant when it comes to rating the quality of movies. This was so disappointing.", "SPOILER: The plot follows Thanos around on his quest to collect 5 stones, achieve control of all dimensions and eliminate half of humanity in an attempt to save planets from population induced ecosystem destruction/annihilation. Each stone quest involves 10 minutes or so of the same CGI fighting. Why 5 stones? Why not, they've got time to fill. Lots and lots of time. Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way. He should have sterilized half the planet, not dissolve them.", "Not to be cerebral because this movie is not that. I had to put my input as well and agree that this film does not deserve a high rating as IMDb's users are placing it to be. This movie is tiring in both a good and bad way. Too much action crammed in a 2.5 hour movie. This story should have been serialized or someplace like Netflix where they can hash out a story in an episodic format, like a comic book. I agree with others with plot holes, but we must remember that this is a comic book movie and you have to expect that. I see where certain Hollywood producers are criticizing the comic book film genre and the constant release of these films. I feel that the genre has peaked with this movie.", "Movie was good until the ending. Absolutely sucked. I would have much rather had them make a 4-5 hour movie than have them leave it like they did. After that ending I'm not sure I care to watch anymore Marvel movies. And if I do ever watch more of them I'll wait until they're on Redbox or at my local library so that way I don't have to pay an arm and a leg to potentially suffer this kind of disappointment from a movie again.", "To cut to the chase without spoilers. This movie is a drama and i advice everyone who want to see this movie to do it, but not now. You HAVE to wait for the next part of the movie and before that appears go and watch them both. I\u00b4m a very big fan of superheroes and went and saw every movie fom Marvel and DC but this movie only disappoints. I have the expectation to walk out of the theater and be glad with a good taste in my mouth but after seeng this movie i only went out angry with a very bad feeling in my belly. That\u00b4s not the point. I realy don\u00b4t understand why they did it in such a manner when they could have done it 100 times better.", "If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. \nThere's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. \nToo much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.\nWakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.\nAnyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.", "I think there's waaayyy too many 10/10s here. I saw it on the IMAX. This film did not blow me away. A 10/10 film should be able to stand alone as a great film; this clearly wasn't that. Due to the fact there were so many characters, you couldn't help but feel the rush to make sure everyone had screentime and that was at the expense of storytelling, which as you'll see below, it could have done with a bit more of.  As I hadn't watched all the other relevant marvel films, I didn't quite understand some of the character's strained relationships with each other - they could have at least done a flashback...but then I guess there'd be even less time for storytelling! It was a 'good' film, but I regret going to see it at the cinema. Good Netflix fodder.", "I collected the comics when I was a kid, for twenty years, and seeing these movies is a bit of a downer. Sure the action is good and the CG is mostly great, but the story is nothing like the comics I collected. There are too many jokes. Too much humor. Too many characters that don't need to be there and where not there originally. I sat through the movie and enjoyed it for what it was, a visual fun fest. The story lacked depth. Thanos's desire to have all the stones and to destroy 50% of life was terrible because the real story wasn't told. The story they showed was a lie for the purpose of doing a cash grab. Again, for action it was awesome. It is fast paced and there is very little slow time in the movie. It is the script I didn't like. Sigh. I think I'll just stop watching movies. I think they, Hollywood, has forgotten how to make them great.", "I was so angry after watching that I had to write something. Boring boring boring, the biggest reason for that is scenario 0/10. It is too long, if I hadn't go to cinema and bought ticket there is no way I would have patience to watch it until the end. Everything already seen in previous marvel movies, it seems that every new is even worse with lower quality and I didn't even have big expectations before the movie. The main reason I decided to watch it is IMDB rate 9/10 which is total fraud and paid advertisement. There is no guarantee if some character is dead that he will remain dead, everyone could resurrect...Go watch anything else than this. My last marvel movie for sure, so angry that I don't watch american movies in cinema any more, all the same, low quality in recent time, just to make many fast, without proper scenario...bull..it", "Man, i miss those days when superhero movies were actually good.  tou know like the dark knight trilogy or spider man 2 and even LOGAN made me restore a little faith in this genre . this movie was the most overstuffed and over the top and unnecessary movie i'v ever seen. the dialogue as always seems like its written for 10 year old kids, but what else can you expect from Disney. and of course this movie will make a lot of money and so do the fast and furious movies. people seem to want garbage these days. oh and btw SPOILER! a lot of them die a the en, but guess what. they are guaranteed to come back in Avengers . smh. and i don't fault marvel for their universe filled with MEDIOCRE movies. we blame Disney. kind of how like they ruined last Jedi.  we should bring back Sam Raimi or Christopher Nolan to save the superhero genre", "Over the years, we have watched so many hero movies from Marvel. Slowly.....they become dull . I'm bored after watching this movie. Also, I'm a little upset and angry at the same time. Too splendid....too much going on and the ending is ummmm ok. Some characters I do love are Iron Man and Spiderman. Now.......Let's get slamed by the Marvel's fans. No offense!", "Lets keep it real, the movie was overhyped by Marvel fanbois. And if we're being honest this movie actually deserves a 6 or 7 rating. It started weird, and as someone pointed out already the Order didnt get an introduction, and theres no need since theyre all dead. Escaping Asgard when Hella destroyed it was pointless since they're all dead as far as we know, unless Loki used some magic to hide them.. but going back to the beginning of the movie.... we dont know. It was a pile of shi and we need to stop rewarding crap with praise. Im sure part 2 will be better but very overhyped by fanbois, the weakest link in the chain", "So boring. Feel like watching stupid drama series. When I see this movie all I can do is boring and think when this gonna end.", "This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).\nAlso, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.\nAnd to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.\nNot worth the cash, not worth the hype, not worth another word.", "Seriously when are these editors going to get their crap together & cut it! Hm? You don't need to drag a film on & on for what seems like an eternity! Cut the crap! Cut it! Get to the point already!! As usual, story-line was confusing, too wrapped up with own issues other than saving peoples lives, which is what these films have missed the point of over time, not to mention bad editing, & poorly executed narrative. They weren't speaking English as I had no idea what they were talking about half the time or should I say most of the time! Maybe if they cut the cra[ & made the film snappy it probably would've made more sense & instead of dragging the climax out in such a choppy changing like manner (what climax, I'll get to that later) anyway, as well as repetitive, the climaxes ending was all over the place! Bad guys gets \"killed\", comes back again, gets killed, comes back, more chopping & changing, then a slow dragged out scene, then back to the climax! The end outstayed its welcome, & well as soon as it got to the 2hr mark, you knew they need to wrap it up, but it took another 40mins to do that! Damn! And the ending... don't make me laugh!! The ending could've happened much much sooner! So much so they dragged out a climax for this? I mean the ending was an insult alone, without the other reason being that it took them nearly an hour till they gave us this pile of horse crap! Oh my god!! Overall crap! DON'T watch! 2/10", "Good action scenes, but that's about all this has to offer.\nOh, and the dialogue between Stark and Strange was at least interesting.\nI thought Thanos would be a real badass, but then he has a crying scene! Give me a break! Also, Banner could not transform into Hulk! \nActing was just okay, Downey and Cumberbatch were best, by far.\nStory was predictable and pretty boring, ending was confusing.\nAnother movie that fails to live up to the hype.", "A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui. It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died. The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly. I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan. It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.", "If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie. It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters. Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of \"wait, where are we?\" or \"wait, why are they fighting again?\". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB! That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.", "Is the movie worth watching? Yes. Is it deserving of a 8.9? No. It is a good movie?Sure. Are there plot holes/issues? Yes. What percentage of the film is CGI? 90%. Would I pay $20 to see it in theatres again? No. Would I buy it in an $5 Walmart Bin? Probably Not. Would I watch it again? Yes", "If you love all the other mcu films, you will probably love this one. If you are an avid film enthusiast like myself, you will probably have similar complaints to what im going to say.\nFor one, this film tries to focus on more things than what it is actually capable of pulling off. There are so many characters in the film that characters like black widow and black panther are reduced to seconds of screen time. Characters that are actually somewhat integral to the plot are so one dimensional they might as well get seconds of screen time.\nOn top of that, characters that usually bring forth tons of charm regardless of the movie's quality (like thor or star lord) are completely unlikable in this movie. Actors like Robert Downey Jr completely phoned in their performances, and it made for a dull atmosphere even compared to other sub-par mcu films. \nThe direction in this movie is TERRIBLE. It was so poorly handled. For example, Gamorrah's death scene was shot like a low budget sappy music video. The shots were so distracting I actually laughed at some attempted dramatic moments in the film.\nOverall this film is not good cinema. If you enjoy mindless entertainment with an underdeveloped villain and hipster captain America then this is the movie for you. If however, you want some form of artistic value in your films, I would skip this one and go watch the hiding place (its much less of a waste of your time).", "I don't know how or who rated it above 8. Really disappointed", "In order to explain current mass appeal, I have to quote Senator Gracchus in Gladiator: \"Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they'll be distracted.\" And that's what this is, conjured magic meant to distract the masses, and by gosh, that's what it's done. No real plot. Overlapping storylines that go nowhere, computer animated trash, and that's the point. Give the masses what they want, come up with the formula, spend $350 to develop, and presto, $2b in receipts from the mob, who can't distinguish between art and trash. Wash, rinse, repeat.", "So, this was it, the culmination of a decade of Marvel movies preparing and leading up to this final showdown? Well, I could not be more disappointed. Here is why:\n A few examples (Spoilers!!!):\n Never after a Marvel movie, reading \"Thanos will return\" on screen, did I think, \"Better not, good riddance, and I'm most definitely not waiting for it\". This is not a weekly serial where one could tolerate such a deep cliffhanger. And if it is not a cliffhanger, then what? All really dead? And from now on only prequels?  What a great disappointment. 2 hours of FX and CGI fights with a few funny scenes mixed in. That's all. No clever story anywhere in this movie, maybe later, but that's not the basis for a rating of this movie. So much opportunity for great story telling, so many cool and deep characters, and then this uncreative and unmotivated piece with this disappointing cliffhanger. Ok, granted, it is most certainly not the end of the story and all will be smart and clever in the sequel. Maybe, but this here right now is mostly lame and stupid and far behind the possibilities.", "Lots of spectacle, clever banter & special effects. Lousy ending. It's really just a trailer for the sequel. I wasted my money.", "OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.  Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant monster human called Thanos who wants the stones called the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(chris Pratt, Zoe salvada). Will they stop Thano? The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However I didn't find it any good. The downside of it was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.  Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead.", "Can anybody explain to me, what was good about this movie other than the special effects? I left the movie dissappointed and with a grudge against Marvel.", "Disappointing.\nSimply and enough said.\nDo not recommend.", "Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.\nNow take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?\nYou will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:\nSlick action and stunning visuals.\nThe producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here.  Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond. With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.\nThe story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.\n(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)\nThe supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.\n On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.\nThano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing!  Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life. As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this.  Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?\nOpinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie. Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme. 2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.", "Nice visuals :-), but honestly, when I go to a cinema, I go there to enjoy myself and come out happy. The advertising for this movie was a huge gimmick that rode the Black Panther wave, which had people buying tickets. Most people are desperate for the sequel now. I left the theatre with people watching all the credits, hoping for something to happen. If you speak to Marvel fans, they argue with you, claiming that the sequel will be great. Meaning this one was bad to some extent. The movie didn't have to drag out for so long. Everything felt very DragonBall Z'ish, but no pleasure in the end. I seriously wish I had watched something else.", "SPOILER: This is pure population bomb stuff written in the 60s. The battle is to become a God which Danos does despite the long battle \"too long I think\" to stop him gaining ultimate power. He does and to save life in the universe he eliminates 50% in order to save them! Pure deep green stuff who do not understand populations grow to meet the resource not the other way round. A huge disappointment and badly written.", "Two and a half hours of film that'll be reversed in the first 10 minutes of Captain Marvel. Fun fight scenes, garbage plot, and yes I know it's allegedly building up to something, doesn't matter, still big let down...at least Deadpool 2 is only a month away", "Marvel seems to be on a roll towards killing off this franchise. The previous entry...Black Panther...was, generously, just OK but Av:IW was just awful. This entry was abt an hour too long and way too slow to develop. I had trouble staying awake at times. The final battle scene was OK but the entire movie was dark. I don't mean the theme, I mean the pucture itself was dark. So dark that in some interior scenes it was difficult to see what was going on. Save your time and money.", "I'm not a great fan of Marvel, but I went to see this movie thinking it would be a bit of a romp. You know, something light-hearted and fun, with some great action sequences worthy of a big screen. Where the heroes win in the end. The action sequences were epic. The plot had holes that were just as big. Sure, some of those might be resolved in the next movie, and the heroes will probably win in the end, but the ending was an anti-climax, made worse because of the needlessly sappy and drawn out failures of all the different Avengers. At the end of the movie, no one left the cinema. The audience sat there stunned, waiting for some glimmer of hope. It never came. There was defeat. There was death. There wasn't the satisfying victory to help ease the long set up and the forced attempts at humor. Even the post-credit teaser was depressing. I won't write this movie off completely given there's more to come, but disappointing to have to wait until the next movie for some catharsis.", "Kill kill kill. Death. That's what this movie is about. To their credit, the actors in this film were all great, despite each being given minimal screen time, with near zero character development. There are just too many characters and angles, each with the same ultimatum: KILL. (They are all trying to kill the villain Thanos, of course, but it's still Kill Kill Kill!) I never felt any passion for any of them until Gamora was thrown to her death by her POS step dad Thanos. When we see movies we want to feel the passion of the characters we are watching. None existed until this moment. My favorite character in this film is Peter Quill. Way to go Chris Pratt. He brought depth and passion, sorrow and love, to his role. He is the stand out in this film. I cried when he cried. I was pissed off when he was pissed off. Peter Quill / Star Lord was the sole representative of human emotion in this film. And he did it well. On the technical note, Thanos just looks like a cartoon character.\n(No offense, Josh Brolin, you were GREAT as Thanos!!)\nCGI always looks fake. I watched the entire movie imagining the \"green screen\" behind all of them. In a few years, actors won't be needed at all. Iron Man could have just gotten a huge eraser to erase Thanos The Cartoon.\nHave a great summer!", "Ok I know rating a movie like this 2 star is going to seem like hate, but let me explain. \n1) I feel like tony stark is an arrogant douchebag and I don't like that he's stronger that other \"super\"heroes  2) I'm not a fan of the over used plot device of \"I must kill my loved one to save the universe\". It's just fake tension most of the time and because most of the main characters are wearing main character armor, they either don't get killed or revived anyway  3) the ending didn't wrap up any loose ends at all and isn't really dramatic anyway  4) I miss when Spider-Man was cool and not some lame dork iron man bossed around  5) the hulk just didn't want to participate in the movie for unknown reasons and he's also one of my favorites  6) I didn't like that the \"good\" guys just gave the bad guy the rock he wanted... twice  7) where was the \"orange\" black panther character as he was my favorite one ?  8) how did that one good guy with the rock in his head, vision, survive when his neurosurgery was incomplete ?  9) why did we keep saving that one girl, to just throw her off a cliff? And she was also one of my favorites 10) the dialogue was weak in the movie as a whole and most of the \"comedic\" moments weren't funny outside of Star-Lord, who was great by the way  11) the dialogue was weird between between Gamora and thanos. Why did she never understand how he felt about her ? That made the endingish scene weird because she didn't understand she was going to get thrown off the cliff until he grabbed her", "Lotsa flashing lights and loud noises, little else. Went home and watched \"The Wolverine\" (the second one) to be reminded of what I like in a popcorn flick.", "Every once in a while you walk out of the theatres after seeing the New Big Thing and disappointingly conclude: \"This wasn't made for me\". Which is fine. I don't follow the hype, I don't watch the trailers and don't bother keeping up much with continuity. I generally watch these movies and my reactions tend to fall somewhere in between \"technically competent but flawed\" (e.g. Doctor Strange) to the rarer \"pretty damn good\" (e.g. Black Panther). Because technical competency is never lacking - the writing is generally sharp, casting and acting as well. Infinity War is technically competent. From what I gather from the more avid watchers of these movies, continuity and fan-service is on top. It's really quite funny - I especially enjoy the Guardians team. But I don't think it's particularly fun, especially not after the first third. The pacing gets bogged down majorly in the second act and you can feel the plot structure bursting at the seems as it tries to force a dozen separate stories and half-hearted arcs into something resembling a traditional movie structure. And it still feels like an hour of character development was roughly cut. Somewhere in the middle of the movie two characters bizarrely meet after one has been missing and presumed dead - which is awkward - but the tension between them is never addressed after this point and I don't even think they share any more dialogue. Here is where the weaknesses in directing seem to become apparent to the point of harmfulness. The Russos directed the last two Captain America movies well enough (the last one being a better Avengers 2 than the actual Avengers 2) but Infinity War seems to be too big of a challenge. Maybe it was too big of a challenge for any director. A large amount of the focus on character-driven story-telling has fallen to Thanos, who until now has only appeared at the margins of the rest of the universe. And it kind of works. Many directors seem to struggle with relatable antagonists with clear and understandable motivations. That's what makes Killmonger so great. He's frightening because he just may be right. And the angle of antagonist-who-sees-himself-as-hero almost works in Infinity War. Except Thanos' motivations are so ridiculously - and I try to avoid using this word in general - stupid that I couldn't possibly take them seriously. Admittedly, a lot of people can and I'm not going to judge anyone for that. But Thor could have handed Thanos a book on basic political theory and obliterated his entire worldview. Half the audience was in loud glee and half was in loud anger when the credits rolled. And I have to say I was in the latter camp. But I'm not sure it's fair to get as angry as I initially was. Maybe I'll warm up to it on a second watching. For now, I feel cheated. If the movie was called \"Avengers: Infinity War - Part One\" I probably wouldn't have minded. Or if I kept up with the hype. Which brings me back to my original point. This movie wasn't made for me. I expected it to be something else. Most of the time I just wished the Black Panther universe had more to do with it. Or I just want another Black Panther movie. Infinity War has me exhausted on Marvel. It isn't bad or offensive or really any other strong adjective. It's just bland, poorly structured and disappointing.", "Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better. Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.\n1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch. 2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man. 3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them. 4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time? 5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't? Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.\n1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE! 2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything? 3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say \"You guys are so screwed now!\". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone? I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).", "High section of people say infinity war is best movie of mcu even they know it is not perfect except thanos character development and nothing more and it dont appeal to every one with the over crowd and lack of character developments and they try to sell the emotion in the movie by the climax but majority people know there was upcoming spideman2 coming 2019 and gaurdians of the galaxy coming 2020 . i agree it is a complete entertainment movie but it doesn't carry the movie to be great movie this is only for the people who say infinity war is best mcu movie. for me i only liked thanos and thor stuff rest is come and go but i loved the movie whole but not in top 3 mcu films if marvel dint announce the upcoming films that's complete different opinion from me. #NoStakesEntertainment", "I've seen bad movies before,\nbut I have not felt fooled while leaving the theater before.

I understand that 31 movies have \"led\" to this. Nevertheless I left disgruntled at the end and didn't waste any more time waiting for the post credit scenes. There was too much senseless fighting, too little story. Too many idiotic plot holes. Too many characters just killed for the sake of it. Thor gets his ass whipped at the start of the movie, but nearly kills Thanos when he has all the stones. At the end some of the more popular characters like Black Panther, Doctor Strange and Spiderman turn into ashes and you really KNOW that it is not going to be permanent. So why do it in the first place? Why not show how half of the universe is actually \"re-balanced\" and what that actually means and what the reaction of the universe will be. Avengers are little on that scale and with some many brilliant minds in their rows they were unprepared. Civil War or not...", "All this Marvel movies are not my kind of film, I grant you that but the comments and box office bonanza, plus the eclectic cast made me think I couldn't ignore it and I didn't. To make matters a bit edgier I escorted to the movie a great movie lover born in the 1940's. She remembers going to see Ben-Hur the day it opened and one of her favorite films of all time is \"2001 A Space Odyssey\" As we were leaving the theater after the two and a half hours of the Avengers, my guest had two immediate comments. \"I have a headache\" and \"I didn't understand anything\" and we as we sat for dinner, the subject of Avengers was hardly touched. We talk about a small independent British film \"God's Own Country\" that blow up our minds. We didn't talk about the cast or performances in the Avengers - and acting is one of our favorite subjects - because in fact there are no performances in Avengers but a lot of posing, you know? posing and delivering a line that sounds a bit like a recording. The film is breaking box office records around the world and the audience at our screening truly loved it, even applauded at the end so, it's just us. Unlike my guest I didn't developed a headache but I must say, I didn't understand anything.", "In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. \n \nThe day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel.

Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured:\n1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney\n2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow. Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence. The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade. The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life. With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.", "Once Thanos has the time stone, simply shoot back a thousand or so years so he can sit on his mountain side and relax. After a thousand years, do it again. If he's so concerned about his \"daughter\", why wouldn't he be concerned about wiping out half of the universe population? Doesn't make sense. Why wipe out millions of lives if you can go back in time and prevent them from even existing? \nWonderful visuals and audio, but the scriptwriting is lazy at best. \nI wonder how much the actor who played Loki got paid for 10 min of screen time?", "It totally wasn't how i expected it to be. It's just a silly film with only action. Many cringy dialogues and dumb moments ruined the film. I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.", "The movie is a great example of kitsch. A definition from web:\n\"Kitsch is art that's garish, nostalgic, and very low-brow. Some people who love the aesthetics of souvenir culture think kitsch is really cool, while others think it's in very poor taste. Kitsch is a German word that's been adopted into English, meaning \"worthless, trashy art,\" or the quality of that art. A ceramic figurine of a puppy with sad eyes is pretty kitsch, as is a velvet Elvis painting. Of course some people think that kitsch is really beautiful and fill their homes with stuff that other people consider trashy souvenirs. If your painting teacher tells you your portraits are kitsch, that's probably not a compliment.\"", "I loved seeing all of our superheroes together, but this film was just too long. And we know nobody will really die.", "SPOILER: I have tried to write this review 3 times unfortunately every time there is a problem!!!!!\nSo instead of an in depth review all I can say is this is just not funny and the story line incorporating so many characters (heroes) is confusing and just pants particularly when 50%of said heroes die... all good for a sequel but crap story guys.\nSeriously unfunny unlike Deadpool 2 which was awesome.\nTo conclude unless you are going to do a lot better than this storyline don't bother with the sequel because no one will be interested..", "Deserves like not even a 1 star. this movie was nothing but CGI filled with subpar performances and a very mad score/soundtrack. the movie is basically just an ad for avengers 4. and in this film deaths occur at the end but they don't mean anything since all of them will come back. what? this is absolute trash storytelling. you expect audience to be sad and then just bring the characters back the next film.", "Not that great- WAY too long, too unengaging and too many plot holes-just too much period. I'm notorious for crying in movies;didn't even sniffle, and there were many \"deaths\" of my fav characters. \"Poignant\" scenes were all flat, I didn't buy into any of them at all. Always a bad sign when I'm checking my watch and realizing I still have to sit there for 45 more minutes- didn't even stay for the bonus at the end. Yawn! Knew I waited for a reason, and I'm sorry I saw this- the individual movies are light years better- would still pay to see Black Panther/ Captain America/ Wonder Woman again, and I've seen them multiple times already. Jmo, but meh. Pretty disappointed.", "This movie Is over hyped. The title of this movie should be Infinity War Part 1 & I fail to see how another 2 hours of Thanos Barnie like skin and clam shell chin will make for good entertainment.", "I only saw a bored and weak plot, nothing new, all time with this kind of movies is marketing, I am getting bored with super heroes movies, even more action parts are so simples", "SPOILER: The plot is simple that the supervillian succeeds, but Russo brothers waste too much time on piling up the superheroes. The film is just too long, and you keep looking at the watch to see when it will end. There are too many characters, and if you did not view the previous Marvel films, you would hardly get any sense of who they are. It is an OK film for Marvel fans, but chaos for a general audience.", "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. \nThat being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds. Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise. Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. \nInfinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.\n \nSo, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about. Great CGI. No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce. Too many characters. The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. \nFor the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters. It bordered on a comedy. For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. \nWhile some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail. Geared towards a younger audience.  As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents.  It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. \nMost of us have outgrown the cliches.  Poor ending. Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling.  A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film. Overall 6.4/10", "Nothing made sense in this marvel movie. When back in the day people used to make fun of superhero movies for their vapid storylines and characters, i actually found ironman to have a very good character development and even the 1st avengers to be entertaining and most MCU movies to have a logical flow. This movie made no sense and was just 3 hours worth of deus ex machina. This IS ther superhero movie people used to complain about.

What really got me though was the scene in Edinburgh, DC had no right to film here and I found it offensive and frankly cruel the way they portrayed Scottish culture. I felt like throwing up in my popcorn box. Another thing that really hit me hard was the death of my old friend Vision. I had a deep emotional and romantic connection to that youngster so when he dissolved or whatever I just couldn't stop the waterworks. Causing me to embarrass myself in front of my girl. I was so bored during the part where Mhanos was mumbling something my brain couldn't even transmit into English I found myself wobbling one of my teeth that was causing me a spot of pain after I bit into a Oreo to hard.

Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while.

I was sooo bored.", "12 jokes within 3 minutes in conversation between Doctor Strange, Hulk and Iron Man in the beginning of movie. Too silly then super serious, switching back and forth. There were more humorous moments in this movie than any other MCU film, more than Thor Ragnarok. Avengers Infinity War should have some comedy description or category. Disney needs to stop with the excessive humor. Thanos motive is weak and uninteresting in film. \nI don't recognize Thanos THE MAD TITAN from the comic books, he's too simple in this movie. LADY DEATH's influence over Thanos is more coherent. But that's what happens when a children's company takes over a sophisticated comic book company, they change the stories for kids and add lots and lots of humor.  One more thing, title of movie is incorrect. \nThis movie is Disney's adaptation of the Infinity Gauntlet series, not Infinity War. \nWhat was the point of Disney' mixup of titles? The answer is Disney wanted to confuse people that might spoil movie with their comic book knowledge. This avoids negative reactions from social media during production to post production. \n 2/10 stars because of Disney's cheesy Mickey Mouse adaptation of Thanos the Emo Crybaby, Peter Quill should dance for Thanos to cheer him up.", "While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down \"Infinity War.\" It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as \"Black Panther\" and \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" and some I have despised, such as \"Iron Man 2\" and \"The Avengers.\" \"Infinity War\" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise. The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with \"Avengers: Infinity War.\" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from \"Thor: Ragnarok\" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that. Character stupidity is at an all time high in \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie. The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population. Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest. Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over. The two things that \"Infinity War\" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.' Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it. \"Infinity War,\" to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.", "Compared to the original story that started with Infinity Gauntlet, this one was very swallow, specially due to the absence of Adam Warlock. Too many jokes, poor story and too many characters simply thrown in the story and used in a very bad way made this a mediocre movie at best.", "First off i'll start by saying that i'm a marvel/superhero fanatic, i have an imdb account older than 10 years and this is my FIRST AND ONLY REVIEW. I'm still a little kid inside which loves superheroes. If you are the same, then you should understand the following. This movie is NOTHING except some fancy effects and some funny lines here and there. The only thing that made me give this movie 3 stars are the actors which gave me goosebumps when i saw them, the hope they bring (yes, i'm naive that way). Besides these facts, Infinity War is the biggest marvel movie dissapointment in their history which lead to an ending that couldn't be more evil (100% victory for Thanos), half the universe dies, heroes included. If you are one of those people who like happy endings, like me, this movie will dissapoint you to your core. It is sad that we have to witness the biggest weekend boxoffice for such a horrible movie. DO NOT be fooled by the big ratings on IMBD, we all know nowadays movie reviews in here are rigged more than the national lotery.", "We all know that these movies are blockbusters , we know that we should not expect much , when someone sits through one of these he /she should not expect citizen Kane , or the seventh seal , these movies are almost always mindless action scenes and big bangs and boom ( throw in a few punch line and some lame one liners and voila you have have your self an action movie ) but , at the same time these movies must be compared with other movies of the same genre , even the same universe to see pros and cons and for this i like to review it based on two of my favorite MCU movies. Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .", "Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.\nReturning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.\nThe last \"Avengers\" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.\nYes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine. But the \"Avengers\" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.\n\"Infinity War\" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.\nI quote a friend: What's the fool, the one who wrote the screenplay or the one who laughed at the jokes of the \"Guardians of Galaxy\"?", "I mean this was a decent movie, but come on. Ranking above \" It's a Wonderful Life \" and \"The Usual Suspects \" is bullshit. Marvel doesn't make cinematic classics, they make action filled blockbusters with no substance and 8 year old could understand.

A bunch of ppl runnung around having fun, looked like a party movie. It was like a potpourri: we've recently seen every scene in a bunch of another super hero movies. Even the final sequence is similar to X-men. All those \"professional critics\" who write these prepaid positive reviews for yet another Disney's garbage should be ashamed of themselves.

Olsen was great though.", "I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater. First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite.  I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden.  The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked.  They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora.  Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand. The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long.  If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story.  I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first?  I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think: \"I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10?  But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?", "Marvel has not followed the comics closely or consistently, hence the reason this film caught me so off guard...it was like GOT on steroids. The body count is ridiculous! People go to the movies to be entertained, this movie is no fun! Most people left the premiere looking stunned or irritated.", "I mean I don't get it why this movie came in the top 250 movies in IMDb. I am not saying that this is a bad movie but the best super hero movie ever? People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.", "I had to make a list of why this is so poorly made after seeing the film (I even made my account just to do this). It makes me really mad because it promotes bad films with a high budget, but i will try to convince you not to waste time watching it : 1 - lots of scenes which don't add anything to the story, this film could be 1h40 long without any probleme\n2 - fighting scenes without any tactic and where everyone waits it's turn\n3 - fighting scenes scenes with explosions (is it supposed to be entertaining ? ) and no tactic, they simply punch and kick\n4 - they give up stones too easely (which apparently could save the universe, but why do it ?) The caracters don't know how to make a choice\n5 - The actors speak a lot but are not that good\n6 - aside from the scenario, the film isn't even interesting visually nor the audio Making more arguments is actually hard because this film is just about idiots fighting and \"jokes\" over and over\nMy one star is to balance all theses undiserved good reviews, I personally think it should be rated with a solid 3,5", "Disney ruined more great characters by having too political writers involved and ruining important characterizations of developed and loved personas. WTG Disney for screwing up another movie.", "This movie was litterly the same as the avengers and civil war. Nothing new here except that the hype is getting stronger??? By rules of nature hype must die down over time but marvel fanboys want more bad movies? Disney's board of director's and their shareholders are laughing their ass off. They acquire the rights of a universe with some superheroes en then they release 5 superhero movies a year that are complete and utter trash but its fanbase will love it no matter wat. now a cgi war movie (were we all now how of how it will end, it doesn't becouse Disney will keep spitting out these movies until marvel fanboys stop going to these trash movies.) Is considerd better than movies like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, forrest gump and Leon??? Well if this is the case than i will leave this site and never come back becouse i use this site to see if a movie is worth seeing. But if a crap movie like this is considerd to be as good as THE GODFATHER!!! then i can no longer trust this site and will de-recommend it to everyone that wants to use it for the same purpose as i did.", "That said, the film in itself is very well made. It gives you all the adrenaline rushes that you deserve and all the dry wit that you can handle. It's a true Marvel flick and does justice to it's franchise. Go watch it. Infinity War might leave you with disbelief or wanting more, but it does entertain as promised.", "I'm tired of the comic based movie genre which further signals the death of original scripts and content. Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, \"Where is the beef?\", or in my case a good story and characters I care about.", "In all my years as a Marvel Comic fan this is the worst outing as far as I am concerned. Yes it did follow through on many out lying factors but I was gob-smacked as to the ending. While I will not give away the ending I will say I was greatly displeased. It would make me think hard about spending my money on their next Marvel outing", "I enjoyed all of the Avengers movies, but this one was very disappointed.", "I never write reviews, and I'm a very very big supporter of the marvel universe, but this movie is the most depressing thing ever!!!! WHY!!?? WHY!!?? JUST WHY!!!!!!??\nI felt like I needed to vent out my frustration, because the end left me with such a sourness that I don't know how to explain it!! \nI hope they do something about all my favorite DEAD characters in the next movie!", "I don't recognize the THANOS The MAD TITAN from the comic books. Thanos would NOT waste his time balancing the universe if he didn't get something out of it which was Lady Death's love. Lady Death's influence with romance makes more sense. Disney's Mickey Mouse version of Thanos was easy on the Avengers. The MAD TITAN in comics books would have not been sooo fun loving and bubbly, hilarious. Thanos motive in Disney's Mickey Mouse Avengers Infinity War movie is stupid and illogical. Mickey Mouse has turned Thanos into an EMO CRYBABY. Booo!!! Kiddie Disney ruined Avengers Infinity War which is really the Gauntlet story. DIsney can't get the titles right either. Booo!  Mickey Mouse has taking over the Marvel Universe making all comic books for the kiddies kids and less for adults. Booo! Booo! 1/10 stars", "I dip in and out of the Marvel Universe as after a while they all seem to follow the same trend. Hero is loses. Hero comes back even stronger. Big fight. Hero wins. However, the good thing about a cross over is that there is a bit more of a story, and that statement is certainly true with Avengers Infinity War.  Overall, I enjoyed it. The story was good and I like that the ending wasn't a cop out and that it sets up for another. However, of the 20+ Marvel Hero's this film introduces, about 6 of them have decent air time. I love that Thor teamed up with the Guardians, this made for great comedic viewing, but for fans of the Black Widow and Captain America, prepare to be disappointed. The Capt punches some people and looks sad, BW has ' a girl fight' (which to me seems put in there, purely to please female viewers (which I doubt it will)).  To sum this up in a sentence, it was a good film with an enjoyable story line and certainly continued the Marvel world, however, IT WAS NOT ENTERTAINING!!!! It will be a very long time till I watch it again, if ever.", "Full of CGI, no dialogue, action packed and zero substance. If you still like these kind of things after a tone of other superhero movies, you will probably enjoy it.", "I think a movie is suppose to give you ideas, make you think, pay a better attention on what's going on around you and show some of precious things in life that we miss on these days, not just a movie about comics with zero quality of being a movie ! Despite the war and all those useless speeches in the movie what else has the movie told you ? The mindset of people nowadays is going crazy and mad, this movie does not worth that rating and I don't know why I wasted my time on this useless movie .", "I just can't comprehend most of the main characters dying at the end of this film such a let down I grew up with most of these characters most of these were my super heroes as a child.Marvel and whoever made the film let our dreams die in this huge let down of a movie part two had better be out of this world", "Black Panther was boring as hell. \nMost Iron Man films were boring as hell. \nDoctor Strange was boring as hell. \nAnd don't forget Superman vs. Batman: BORING!! \nSo what would you expect from this one?", "I paid almost $100 to go see a movie with my family that has a beginning middle and an end, not a beginning middle and a wtf, then walk out of the theatre with a bunch of crying kids because their favourite heroes seemingly died! This movie only gets a 1 out of 10 until the next half of it comes out in a year.", "This film was literally 2 and a half hours of non stop roller coaster action. This may sound like the perfect movie. But just think of this for a moment. The film was literally; Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back. Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours. The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes. Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in. I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure. I get the feeling kids will love this and think it the most epic thing they have ever seen. But parents will be bored. A movie needs to be more than just this.", "First of all, some reviewers think that whoever doesn't like the move is an idiot, obviously those people are the idiots because these are only opinions, now about the movie, I didn't watch it expecting much to be honest, there is a lot of action, more than you have seen in the other previous movies, but my problem is with the plot and how the bad guy could have easily been defeated in more than one way during the movie but obviously no, which only shows to me how greedy the movie producer are, I think many people don't care if the story is bad as long as there is action, but for other people like me this is really an insult to our intelligence. I won't waste my time and money on the next one.", "I left about half way through the movie. Lots of stabbing and banging sounds. If that is your thing you will like it otherwise a lot of mediocre animated action with little substance.", "I've never written a review here, but seeing the ratings of this movie comparable and above to films like Inception, Inglorious Basterds and others just made me want to write it. Is it the best Avengers movie up to now? Probably yes. However, the film relies too much on cheap deaths to make itself interesting with some dull moments and \"witty\" jokes to try and keep the viewer entertained. It really is a fun film to watch and MCU's has really paid off in here. People rating this 10/10 or are stupid enough to not realise that all the characters that we have seen die will come back or are less than 10 years old. It was a fun experience and definitely worth the watch, but does its current rating reflect the actual movie? Absolutely not.", "All the hype made me go to a theater to watch this. Well... what can I say, it is just like 200 other super hero films. Iron-man firing missiles, spider-man jumping around, etc. There is a villain, very strong villain... and what it is that he wants......? He wants to kill half of the population. Why? Because he thinks there is too much people! What!? A villain that is worried about the environment..... he must be from the green party, maybe he is vegan. Anyway... No story whatsoever, but 2 hours of action scenes and good effects (my wife was sleeping after 1 hour)... maybe good for teenagers.", "Will any 14 year old Marvelfan will love this flick? OF COURSE!\nWill any real moviefan will hate this flick? OF COURSE!

People complain about humor. Use your brains and you will see that the humor is necessary yet high quality. There are no mistakes in any of the aspects of the movie. Some minor plot holes but thats it. it's a solid 9.5 movie. An epic journey. With more than 20+ characters Russo brothers managed to an amazing movie with that many caharacters. This is literrally the hardest movie ever in cinema history. And they succeeded amazingly. Which Zack Snyder/DC couldnt do with that terrible movie Batman V Superman. Only 2 or 3 main characters.

I'm swearing off Marvel, swearing off Disney except for the kids' movies, and trying to figure out how to get the theater to not send the money from my ticket to the studio. I don't care if I actually get the money back, I just don't want it to go to the studio for making that train wreck.", "Too much emphasis on realistic violence, whereas the ending was a total obvious bang to wait for the next movie. The story plot was lousy, Might as well turn off your brain while watching.", "A bloated smorgasbord of uninteresting protagonists (save Iron Man) fighting an oaf with magic crystals. Not to mention, an overzealous color pallete and use of CGI that left me longing to stare into a dark, bottomless pit for hours. The obligatory Marvel laugh lines were embarrassingly stale, though inexplicably humorous to the audience. From the cheap moments of social awkwardness or the annoying insecurity of Quill vis a vis Thor, I found myself constantly groaning. I say all this recognizing Justice League was also hot garbage, but at least a few of the characters were interesting. Oh how I miss those halcyon days of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy - where the drama prevailed and the characters were worth caring for. Batman v. Superman had it's flaws (Martha!) but at least it's got heart! I found myself checking my watch less than an hour into Infinity War.

Fully predictable until the very end.\nThe first 2/3 we outright slow and boring. The last 1/3 is bearable. The ending was promising, except for the arbitrary wipeout of the superheroes. Sure the biggest earners remain intact, while the coolest guys (Starlord, the Groot, etc.) are all gone.", "I saw this film the Thursday it came out and I wanted to see if what everyone was saying was true and it wasn't. I'm gonna go through the thing I thought were good and bad.\nGood:\n#1 CGI, visuals\nThe CGI in this film was really, really good. aside from a couple shots of Thanos the CGI was basically perfect. The CGI on Thanos made him look like an actual big purple man. Even getting little facial expressions and markings on his face that other company's wouldn't care to put the detail in for. The visuals in the film made everything look really interesting and gave the film some eye candy all throughout.\n#2 Thanos \nI would still say Loki from the first Avengers was better than Thanos but damn Thanos in this film was relentless and intimidating. Though I didn't care for his motivation, he was much better than Ultron mainly because Thanos never spit out any dumb and painfully unfunny humor.\n#3 Characters (I liked) and character interactions\nThe only characters in the film I liked were: Iron Man, Hulk (or more appropriately Bruce Banner ) , Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Thor, and Thanos. I've already talked about Thanos so I'll talk about the others. The Interactions between Peter, Tony, and Strange were probably one of the best parts of the movie. They were actually kind of funny and were really entertaining. Thor's interactions between the Guardians were good. I didn't find it funny but it was entertaining.\n#4 Action\nThe action was really entertaining and fun. It was creative and done really well. and of course it looked great. There was only one shot of shaky cam and it such a bad shot I literally couldn't see anything.\nBad Things\n#1 Pacing\nThe pacing in the first act wasn't very good. every time it cut to a new group of people the film was just frantically trying to catch up with itself. It gets better in the second and third but but every time it cut to the Guardians the film just came to a grinding halt.\n#2 Humor \nHumor is subjective, I know that. but the humor in the film was painfully unfunny and it wasn't made all that better by the crowd laughing every ten seconds in the theater.\n#3 Character deaths and other characters\nAll the other characters I didn't care for mainly because they either did one thing or nothing. I get that a film with this big of a cast can't include everyone, but damn, to many characters did nothing, they were kind of just their. It's not all the better by the fact that most of the characters that died were characters that did nothing. All the original Avengers were left alive, and I feel like it would've been better if they killed at least one or two of them. the character deaths also weren't that heartbreaking or sad. Some just died and the Film moved on. The only death I cared for was Spider-Man cause he actually had a scene that was at least a little bit sad.\n#4 Romances\nThe romances were just terrible. Wanda and Visions romance was just extremely awkward that was also accompanied with terrible dialogue. The romance between Bruce and Black Widow came back for one or two lines of dialogue and it's literally never acknowledged again.\n#5 Gamora's death.\nThis has a section of it's own because of how horribly obvious it was. It actually amazes me that people were surprised that she died. after she said a line to Star-Lord about killing her if Thanos catches her I instantly knew that she was going to die. and what do you know she died about 30 minutes later. I personally feel it would've been more effective if she started begging Peter to kill her when she actually got captured.\n#6 Star-Lord \nHis entire character was ruined for me. At a point in the film when Thanos is pinned down and they almost have the infinity gauntlet off him and Peter decides to hit Thanos in the face waking him up and thus dooming half the universe. It felt extremely out of character and I thought it would've been better if Drax did it. Thanos did destroy his planet and his family so shouldn't he do it. He is more of a loose canon and Peter is more logical. You might say he didn't attack him because he knew it was a bad idea and he didn't attack him earlier. But that's because Thanos had his guard up and would've easily destroyed him. So, Star- Lord killed everybody.\n#7 Wanda (Scarlet Witch)\nFor my last section I would like to talk about Wanda. She could've easily defeated Thanos because of how powerful she is. There's a point on the Wakanda battlefield where five giant rolling saws are released and she comes out and destroys them instantly. And if she has the power to destroy an infinity stone she should be in battle killing everything.\nIn conclusion this film is massively overrated and shouldn't be the 15th best film of all time according to Imdb. This is a 4/10.", "Spoilers!!! Spoilers: the movie was pretty good, a bit quippy but good for a marvel movie, until the ending. the ending was absolute trash and I regret paying for my ticket. I don't want to pay for half a movie, and that's what this was. I'm pretty upset.", "This movie is such a disappointment that I don't know where to start:\n1) Lack of story line\n2) Disorienting camera work in fight scenes \n3) Zero amusing/comical value scenes This movie doesn't give you anything to keep you engaged.\nI fell asleep 3 times during the movie and couldn't wait to get out the show.\nI have thoroughly enjoyed other Avengers movies and Thor Ragnarok recently.\nThis has just been the worst Marvel movie to date. Only thing going for it is that you can see all the Marvel superhero characters at once.", "How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain. Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle. We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes. Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.", "This movie literally couldve ended in 40 mins\nwhy drag it to put more fight scenes and more jokes? 10 years for this movie plot???? did they hire zack snyder or what cool scenes but couldve been better\nthanos is weaker than he is in comics. black order is way worse! for character strengths, whos ever stronger than another?! one character looks weak at a time OBVIOUSLY to pave way for \"heroic\" scene or entry of another and later the same character does a move proving to be the strongest in the battle zone.\nscrew this logic.  also, if infinity stones are from before the universe, blah blah blah, how do they only affect a mile long lmao? so either thanos is weak or the stones (or both) in mcu", "Had great expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed. Tons of action and special effects, but I found myself getting bored. And the ending was horrible.

Won't be surprised if box office results drop dramatically next weekend as word of mouth gets around.", "This movie made the good cast look stupid and no common sense. Made the bad or evil cast dominating from start to finish. I vote for nonsense movie of the millennium!!!!", "Okay, plenty of action, lots of humor, excitement galore...so why the 1 rating from me? Because, and I'm not telling you one word about how it ends, this has to be the WORST way to end a movie I've ever seen...and wished I hadn't. The heck with it. Guess who won't be lined up to see how the next one goes? That would be ME 'cause frankly, at this point, I don't care.", "I weep for America with miserable drek like this.  FIRST, the storyline was just juvenile and pedestrian. He has to find a little stone for each little hole in his glove. So silly and unimaginative. Worn and done before. SECOND, the sad and depressing ending could only come from the dark minds of twisted 20 and 30 year olds. The generations that spawned mass murder. THIRD, no motif at all. Silly and stupid. \"LORD OF THE RINGS\" - now that is a wonderful movie on true evil, good, and greed. I miss Peter Jackson. Marvel has killed filmmaking with factory garbage. FOURTH, I don't like they way they mocked Jesus. He is real unlike Iron Man and Spiderman. And He's coming again. And he predicted this last generation of nitwits. FOURTH, my ear drums are still hurting from the loud sound. If my wife and I have permanent damage there will be a $1 billion dollar class-action suit against the theater chains and Marvel. See your lawyer if you feel the same as me.", "I walked into the theater thinking that everything was going to be ok and came out shook. I love marvel and all it's movies but i didn't expect there to be that many deaths in IW. Marvel has traumatized me. If one more person dies I'm done, I'm just done", "I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will. Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others. You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze.  The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main \"computer constructed\" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face.  It is a fast based movie with few \"quiet\" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references.  ********** SPOILER Begin**************\nThere were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. \n********** SPOILER end************** Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie.  At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a \"relief\" and ended to be an \"art\".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.", "I am going to say straight away I am not a die hard Marval fan as it all seems a touch far fetched for me, but having said I did enjoy the last avengers film and most recent Spiderman.\nHowever this, although not a terrible watch was as if they had given the film makers unlimited access to budget and special effects. And the result was as if every instrument in an orchestra was all playing very loudly and all at the same time.\nParts felt like I was just watching a computer game and the cgi, and there was a lot of it didn't feel as good as in others. \nThat being said there were more funny parts in this film compared to the others, but was I left thinking about it the next day? No. Would I watch it again? Not unless somebody else asked/forced me to.\nSo overall 6 but more like a high end 5/10 than a solid 6 and I was glad my ticket price was reduced due to an offer.", "I was really excited to watch this third Avengers movie, being that they were going all in with both the Avengers and the Guardian characters but ultimately the movie is just one big mess of a movie. The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up. I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie. Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.", "Unless you're a huge fan of this genre of movie, or of the Avengers, I'd strongly recommend skipping this movie. A friend and I went to see it, and left the theater half way through because we were so bored. Although the special effects are good, there really isn't any plot to speak of. For comparison, Black Panther was a much better movie.", "It just destroyed the image of the previous Avengers movies. It was simply waste of time and money.", "WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS I went to see AIW in the hopes of washing away the taste of mediocrity of Black Panther. Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal. This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments. The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket.  The \"deeper\" interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating.  This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the \"soul infinity stone\". Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet. In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys \"fighting argument\" (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or \"who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy. But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, \"Yuck, this is disgusting\" But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of \"ultimate hero fantasy\" that makes you feel like \"lets simplify\".", "I am a big Marvel fan and I've been waiting 3 years for it. Once the movie began I didn't want the end. It has everything- action, romantic scenes, sad and happy scenes, scenes, where you want to cry out loud, but also- it is funny sometimes. The main villain Thanos is not just some kind of villain- he explains why he do what he do and it is quite interesting and soon it will be reality, I think.\nI went to see this movie twice, because there's so much things happening at once, that I just needed to see it again. I don't regret it. It is so heartbreaking, mind blowing and you will want to see the Avengers 4 right now. I don't know, what to do the whole year. And worse- what am I gonna do after Avengers 4? I can say, that it was the best movie I have ever seen. Thank you Marvel for those happy moments in my life. Can't wait till' next year!", "TL;DR -------------------------------------------------------------- Wow. Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film. It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene). Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time. Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a clich\u00e9, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of \"comedies\" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker? Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX! The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...", "I wish I could have my 2.5 hours back. The film was over-long and packed with way too much violence for what it delivered as entertainment. It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide. I found myself wondering if such indulgences would seem inappropriate to dwell on for a real mass murderer like Rudolf Hoess, why is it appropriate dramatically for Thanos? \nAnswer: It's not.  This film was easily the worst Marvel film I've seen.", "Sorry folks, this movie was ridiculous. Not to mention that it was a dishonor to prime superheroes. It was like \"let's see how many heroes and mind numbing perpetual non stop action we can cram into the same movie\" , not caring about the flow, emotion or even if any of it made sense anymore.\nAnd seriously guys, after everything that went down in Ragnorok, Thor's long awaited proclimation as King of Asgard and the salvation of the Asgardian people, to have it all decimated in the beginning of this film was total crap.\nMarvel needs a huge enema for a Disney flush out and bring Marvel back to its glory.\nSorry folks.....In my humble opinion, I give it a thumbs down ... and only 2 stars, just for Disney's ballz for pulling this crappy film off. What a shame...Disney got to you too, Stan Lee. They even got you to cut Thor's hair off in Ragnorok....that just about wraps it up.", "Before you pay the witches some loot to go for me, hear me out please; The graphics and special effects - brilliant. The story line, well. I do think that they should maybe consider appoint better script writers in the future. It just maybe work on paper but it did not go that well on film.\nThe other major point that just beat the heck out of me was the over focus of certain characters and then the total lack of others. This was more a \"cleanup\" movie than anything else. The end also, just WAY too much and the result thereof - really. The plot was good to a certain point and then this over focus of elements / characters. My sisters (twins) LOVE this movie. Probably watched it in cinema already 4 times together. We do have different taste in stuff and that all fine, I just donated the majority of the Avenger / Hulk / Marvel DVD's to the library. \nMaybe someone will have more perspective than me. This movie halted it all on my side.", "Well ... the only movies i really enjoyed from this Marvel Universe ... are GotG 1,2 and Thor - Dark World and Ragnarok ... especially because are not Earth based, and explore other cultures and civilizations. This one butchered both ... storylines and character groups, with a really childish story follow-up and characters' motivations, an overpowered uni-dimensional antagonist with a relentless and simplistic goal (i guess this is specific to comic-books ... but i hoped the franchise had outgrown those ... and will try a little more depth), way too many action scenes with a known outcome ... no twist, no upset ... nothing to look remotely interesting and to remember about the plot. A bleak ending, with many random and meaningless ... 'deaths' ... which are not even close to be emotional ... because of the random factor ... and because they won't be probably permanent ... which bring us to ... ending with ... major cliffhanger ... which is a very ... poor writing choice for a movie.

The 9.1 rating I saw on IMDB (on April 29) surely contributed to raising my expectations too.\nGreat production, but it was a bit \"all over the place\".\nEntertaining nonetheless.", "Horrible storyline, horrible writing, bad acting. Don't waste your time.", "I wan't planning to waste time writing how boring this overfed turkey is, but then, after hours of ugly nonsense, yawning, waiting for the ex machina that had to be the only possible resolution to this bloated mess, they didn't even bother to conclude. It's a drokkin' episode. I've been conned. I'll never spend a cent for Marvel ever again. After 20 years of iron age ennui, just when I fought they were finally bringing some silver age fun with Ant Man and Spiderman, they release their worst soulless product ever, and close it with a big middle finger to our faces. Just let this company die out, you'll do the world a service.", "Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. \"The sum is much less than the parts\", and/or \"Way too much on the plate\". As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.", "In 2017, the mighty Marvel factory produced three shallow, juvenile comedies that were apparently \"required\" to make Infinity War happen. Infinity War is a culmination of all these previous films: pointless, purposeless (other than to make Avengers 4 happen), a big film filled with nothing. The filmmakers of Infinity War have limited talents and vision, and mistook unnecessary violence and meaningless deaths for \"stakes\" and \"gravitas\". They arrogantly thought by making a villain \"win\" they could suddenly \"elevate\" their bloated yet empty film into something \"great\". Unfortunately with all their futile efforts they created a villain whose motive is dumb and stupid and whose method is even more dumb and stupid. Obviously these Marvel filmmakers haven't studied anthropology or human history or statistics or science, anything that requires engagement from more than a few hundred brain cells. Marvel films have been mostly mediocre at story-telling, and their cinematography and editing have consistently been atrocious. However, some of Marvel characters managed to shine in the past despite mundane, repetitive plots, either due to individual efforts of talented actors, or due to occasional witty and memorable dialogues (the first Avengers). Because of that, some characters have remained popular with the audience. Infinity War destroyed everything that was still good about Marvel. The movie made every single character act irrationally: They constantly make inopportune jokes and idiotic decisions, and often commit kamikaze acts that make you shake your head in disgust instead of feeling anything for their \"heroics\" or \"sacrifices\". These characters have been reduced to nothing but soulless machine parts plugged into this giant Marvel machine to churn out more pointless films. Infinity War is the beginning of the end of Marvel. Anyone who appreciates good filmmaking expecting to see anything decent from Marvel in the future will be surely disappointed.", "The people who love this are idiots. Have all the great CGI you want, fill it with action and laughter BUT when the movie ends with HALF THE UNIVERSE DEAD it's a waste of time for me", "Typical fantasy film with all the bells and whistles, some forced humour, but lacking credibility and a plot. Seriously- everyone breathes in space, Iron Mans suit comes out of nothing, humans fight a god and supreme ruler of the universe and only just manage to loose. Oh and he's only that with his glove on. Hope he's not left handed, that would be awkward. A tiny space ship and a rope manages to re ignite a star capable of forging the most powerful weapons in the universe. How come Thor can kill an entire army with his mighty hammer, but couldn't defeat this one. Where did Hulk get that suit? How can the girl with the red conjuring hands destroy a stone that survived the Big Bang of the universe. Why are these stones in America? Why is the guy with the light yellow stone so useless? Oh and while I'm at it no one has died or will die ever because you can turn back time. And the subliminal message behind the film- genocide is a good thing.", "Its cgi fun but also a big chaotic holey mess. Too much bludgeoning.of forced emotions and a lot of idiocy and actions\nSeriously surprised at the 8-10 syar ratings..", "Why? I ask why?\nWhy did it end bad?\nJust teaching kids,(the ones who marvel was intended to appeal to) that the good guy wins..\nNot ok", "I hated the ending because it obviously left an open to another movie. This is stupid and I will never purchase a marvel movie again because of it. I expected a complete end to the movie", "All Marvel movies look the same, sound the same, feel the same. I thought I was watching Black Panther again. And with 20+ super-heroes there is no time for character development.\nThe first Avengers is still the best, by far...", "I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question:\n\"Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?\" The answer is NO! \nI know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. \nThen, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.", "I can't believe all the overhype this movie sucks \nZero plot .... Not much to say,it just sucks", "I'm confused as to why everyone loves this movie. It kills off half the characters! The storylines seemed jammed together into a forced mess. The constant jokes when half of creation is dying are ridiculous. The whole premiss is about Thanos wanting all the stones to destroy half of the world(s) because everyone is running out of resources. He has all the stones now, so why wouldn't he come up with a better solution thN that? He can alter time, reality, etc. Oh, and did I mention that they KILLED OFF HALF THE CHARACTERS?!?", "Avengers: Infinity War Lots of CHARACTERS But BAD SCRIPT & SUPER BAD E N D I N G........!!!!!!!!!", "Strengths:\nFight scenes were fun. All boom boom smash smash. THOR was badass, and so was Strange. Scar Witch was so great too. \nSeeing corporation between heroes we've never seen interact with before was pretty refreshing. \nThe pace of the second half of the movie really set you to the edge of your seat. Very thrilling.\nSometimes, funny.  \nWeaknesses:\nSome things just didn't make sense? Say, Loki's death. After seeing the Hulk unable to put a dent in Thanos, would Loki actually think that his knife would do anything to Thanos at all? Loki's clearly not an idiot. And also, the asgardians are just gone now? What was the point of the hopeful note at the end of Ragnarok - that home is where the heart is. I guess no hearts needed either.  Above all, Thanos' motives make no sense. His answer to overpopulation is genocide. Great... buuuut, if a single infinity stone, the space stone, can bring infinite power (as we saw in avengers and in the first cap america movie), and a full gauntlet renders the user basically all powerful....? Surely there is a solution other than killing 50% of the universe's population. Can't that big purple head think of a single other solution lol? Marvel tries to paint him as a villain with a cause, but that cause is pretty ridiculous. As a result, the serious atmosphere they keep trying to build around Thanos, what with his slow, dramatic way of talking etc. falls flat. Compare that to the conflict around the accords in civil war. At least that there was some sort of real dilemma there! It made civil war feel more urgent and tangible. Not to mention, the whole thing with Gamora is meant to humanise Thanos but, as she says herself, this isn't love. She was abused by him, and they tried to say that all that brainwashing (aka training) he gave her to be his assassin is OK because he 'actually truly loved her'. I imagine the abuse survivors in the audience were feeling pretty great after seeing that.  You could've reduced Gamora to a literal doll, and her interactions with Thanos would barely change. Most of the time, she's just there. We barely see any of the Gamora that we've grown to love in the previous few films. The plot is repetitive, and a few plot devices are repeated. The \"threaten to torture one person to get the other to give up something\" is used at least THREE times. The plot is: Thanos has stone 1, a fight, stone 2, a fight, stone 3, a fight, etc. until all 6 are on him and he snaps his fingers. The near misses were often just \"the heroes got unlucky\": the battle for the time stone, the final stone with vision (they should've destroyed it ages ago), Thor striking Thanos and \"almost\" getting him. The first time it was interesting, but then it just became annoying.  The idea that \"one person comes before all others\" was the heroic choice??? I don't think there is any reasonable explanation why this is the ethical or moral choice, and we should just accept that this is the basic moral code of every single hero. Probable because of time constraints, but i felt that most characters were just *there*. They have one or two lines, maybe a one liner that a fan of their solo film will remember. E.g. I don't recall any memorable lines from anyone from Wakanda. It relies a lot on the fact that you've watched every other movie, or there is simply no emotional weighting to any deaths or fights. Feels a bit more like a TV series crossover, in that regard.  Humour was a hit and miss. I admit I laughed, but probably more from the overall tension than the actual humour. The skit with starlord and thor about thor being manlier wasn't very appetising, and dragged on. I missed the humour from Ragnarok. This movie is taking itself way too seriously, for something with so many problems in plot. Ragnarok was great because it dealt with weighty themes, but wasn't afraid to joke at the fact that it was a goofy comic book movie, this movie would've been more fun with a bit more of that added in.  Finally, clearly this was a 'part one' movie, but they should've advertised it as such. Many feel cheated that the ending had no closure at all. We can't mourn because it's likely that everyone's going to just be revived again and no one's 100% dead. some find this a good point, because it's making things exciting, but it's kind of - well, now it's another year before anything else happens. OVERALL:\nThe Russos did well trying to get something cohesive together for a movie with dozens of characters, each with a backstory that an audience member cherishes. There are some problems overall, and it certainly wasn't the best possible MCU movie because of how loose it felt, but It was exciting and tense for the most part and so I don't regret watching it.", "I know a lot of you trolls out there are not going to like this review but whatever. 1. To big of a cast. Had too little screen time to be an effective character (all characters) and fit in the plotline effectively. 2. This ties in to not enough screen time, lack of emotional connection to the characters. I simply didn't care that half of the characters died by the end of the movie. Because we all know that most if not all characters are going to return anyway in future movies, it's a financial decision on Marvel's behalf. We all know that these characters are cash cows for Marvel studios so why care that they died when we all know they are going to come back anyway.... 3. Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie. In the end, this movie was the 'might have been' movie. Too many 13 year olds went to see this movie who have never went to see movies before this.", "Dragged on and on and on. Not one likeable character. A special effects movie with no plot. Fight after fight after fight with no one winning.", "I love all the Marvel movies - well, until now. It doesn't seem that the movie ends so much as two-thirds of the way in the writers got bored and said \"let's just phone in a bunch of failures and quit. Note: bad guy winning doesn't automatically make dramatic tension. And you can't just write the characters acting stupid to make them lose. If you'd done your job, there could have been legitimate reasons for failure, not just you writing \"even though their lives are at stake and they are seconds away from getting off Thanos's glove, let's have Chris's Pratt say 'No! I will not hold on one second and beat on him after you get the glove off, I will do it now!' because darn it, it's too tough to expect us to come up with a good reason they fail.\" How about having some of Thanos's followers show up and prevent it? There are so many other problems with the last third, I swear it was written completely separate from the rest. AnAndd what about a simple \"The battle continues in...\" All in all, skip this one and wait for the next.", "Marvel, Disney Studios and so much of Hollywood make movies centered on violence and more violence...this show has genocide, father killing daughter, son killing dad...Hollywood 'rationalizes' that they aren't contributing to violence like school murders and needless slaughter like in Las Vegas....Hollywood and computer game folks are the major cause of continued violence...if Hollywood and computer game people had any guts they'd put a 5 year ban on such wholesale violence...switch to something interesting and engaging like sex....people won't even attempt a trial period to see if violence would be lessened by lessening violence in 'games' and 'movies'...they make excuses to just keep putting out the same junk...the music in the background is the same in all these kinds of flix...boring and utterly brainless...lousy writing and the acting doesn't even matter...I think Downey stopped acting when he stopped 'using'...a waste of money....", "Just violence and computer images...trite...there's almost nothing interesting about this flick...no wonder i like drama", "I was there ten years ago when Iron Man graced our screens. I was too ignorant to see the movie in the cinema but I was there the second the film came out on DVD. One of my all time favourite cinematic memories was seeing The Avengers in 2012 with all of my friends, after Iron Man came out we saw every film leading up to the Avengers in the cinema and stuck around for each post credit scene. Here I am six years after The Avengers, Infinity War tickets go on sale and I buy two for the BFI IMAX in Waterloo for me and my girlfriend. I walked into this movie with nothing but high expectations and they were all met. This film benefits from the existence of the other 18 films in this illustrious franchise. It builds upon every single character thread and arc laid down in previous films. No theme is left untouched and no character is left without their traits and quirks. Time has left it's toll on some and has barely graced others. Iron Man's unwillingness to let go of the life he stepped into 10 years ago shows in his absolute eagerness to step into battle with his new nano-suit. Captain America's optimism has wavered but his ability to fight for what is right hasn't. The romance between Wanda and Vision doesn't feel random or forced because their connection has been present since Age of Ultron and especially Civil War.  This film continues a theme long explored in the MCU, familial issues. First explored by Stark's complex relationship with his Father which culminated in 2016's Civil War this film widely explores the relationship between Gamora and Thanos. And what a relationship it is. Thanos is terrifying but the love and compassion he feels for Gamora makes him even more terrifying.  This movie does what no other superhero film is doing right now, it uses it's original score (sorry Guardians) to the best of it's ability wherever possible.  I would highly recommend seeing this film as it is amazing, it's characters well realised and is a creative masterpiece.", "Its like every other superhero movie...nothing special and waaaay to over hyped!!

This is not Marvel, this is junk!", "Garbage movie. The fact that this is rated #30 movie of all time is just unfathomable!", "When I say best, I mean the most emotionally involved, best action, and true \"villain\" of any of the MCU yet. Brolin's Thanos is the definition of what a Villian is. From the very first second of the movie, to the final fade away, you literally dread the next moment. Sure, there's the typical MCU comedy bits in it to keep you from having a nervous breakdown throughout the movie....but Thanos, is ominous to say the least. The bad part is, even though you want him to lose, there's a reasoning behind his madness, albeit misplaced. He even weeps at one point, and you find yourself wanting to feel for him. It's a hate/love relationship. The massive ensemble of the Avengers team we love has grown to massive proportions, although spread apart. They are emotionally tested every single step of the way in this movie, and the viewer is tested along with them. You sit there trying to make the right choice with them, however hard that may be. Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few....or the one? Just one of the questions pressed upon our mighty heroes throughout the film. But excruciating to feel as they ponder the question with only moments to decide each time. Anyone who doesn't rate this movie at least a 9 has no concept of what these 10 years of the MCU have been building up to. The next year of my life is going to be a lon one waiting to see what happens next. Happy viewing.", "Disney really went all out on this and the sequel. Thanos was a character introduced AFTER my time reading marvel Comics. His character is what we in the gaming world would call OP (Over Powered). How does destroying 50% of all life in the universe bring balance? The whole blasted plot was based on that silly premise! I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison. As with Thor Ragnarok you destroyed a future where Marvel has skipped over many villians and leapfrogged to the top, leaving a barren wasteland for future enemies to \"marvel\" at.", "The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for \"comedy\" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a \"lighter\" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for \"comedy\" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film. Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing \"modern Marvel movies\" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula. The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place? Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were \"just there\". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into \"one united Avengers\" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos. The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it. Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.", "Relies mostly on shock value. not much substance or plot. undid all of thor's character development in thor: ragnarok (loss of eye, hammer). good acting, though! overall, shocking but not surprising.", "So to preface this review, let me start by saying I'm a massive Marvel fan. I've lived, breathed, written and read Marvel since I was eight years old.\nThe Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.", "Jurassic Park, The Sixth Sense, Alien, Harry Potter and The Hangover are great movies. Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.", "This is an average superhero film and waaaaaay overrated. There were moments of humour but there's been so many of these movies that I literally just don't care anymore. Its monotonous, predictable and everything has been done before. If half of \"all life\" dies, why do only half the humans disappear? What about the plants/trees/fish, etc, etc - why don't half of them die as well? It's beyond obvious that they'll all come back somehow in the next film anyway and I really can't be bothered to find out how.", "It's just not a very good movie. Loud dramatic music while a city is destroyed. Tense standoffs where only one good person fights one bad person at a time. Does this sound like every other Marvel CU movie ever? Yep. Like I said in the title, if you're 12 years old you would probably rate this high. Scar Jo and Falcon are the absolute worst characters. I won't give it a 1 star, but I definitely will not rate it higher than a 3.", "The movie had its moments but overall was a let down. The plot at its basic level is a good story line but the surrounding elements are bad. The humor which is usually stellar in the Avengers movies is poorly timed and poorly delivered. The story is disjointed and feels like they wanted to cram as many superheroes into the film as they could regardless if it made sense. \"Two minutes for you and six minutes for you and three minutes for you.\" Hopefully the second movie will be the saving grace.", "This is by far the best Marvel film since the winter soldier.", "This was one of those rare movies that kept my attention. The scenes where amazing, acting was spot on. Tom Holland was the best thing about this film! I'd get it 11 stars if I could.", "Never in my life have I loved a movie so much I needed to see it again immediately after I watched it. My friend was still mourning the character deaths, so I took her home, bought another ticket and went straight back to that theater. This movie is marvelous. Not only am I a hardcore Marvel fan, but I am also a film student and a writer. I absolutely admire and give my applaud to Marvel, for having the patience, the courage, the directors, the producers, the cast, and the crew spending a decade turning 70 years worth of comics into this beloved franchise that brought those stories and characters to life. I'm going to do my best to keep this short and sweet, without spoilers. This movie should be getting nothing but appreciation and praise. This movie is for the fans, not trolls, not critics. The Russo brothers did exceptional, balancing each character perfectly to their own spotlight. Nothing felt over done or unnecessary, every moment was completely motivated and executed beautifully. The character pairings were well thought out, mended well, the character growth and interactions were fun, and I nearly lost it from excitement. Any scene with Thanos was amazing and stressful, his character arc was well developed and almost made me feel for his gentle side, but whenever he walked on screen I was scared for the heroes lives!! The actors, as always, were incredible, but their performances in Infinity War were outstanding, they all deserve Oscars. Despite the few heartwarming jokes and banter, the movie never shifted from it's serious tone, which I appreciate, as the actors held strong emotional moments that will undoubtedly leave you teary-eyed and heartbroken. This movie will leave you laughing, it will leave you shocked by the twists and turns, it will possibly leave you gasping horrified (like me) or screaming (like some fans), and the ending will leave you emotionally crippled by the cliffhanger, but you will be awestruck. The only thing that I wish was a little different was I wish the score was a little less dramatic and more softer and powerful to deliver that emotion further. I wish they got Hans Zimmer to score the Avengers, but I'm not removing a star for that, because all in all Avengers: Infinity War is a masterpiece, and it takes a lot for me to called a movie a masterpiece, even if its Marvel, but Infinity War pasted all expectations. Do not miss this experience. It is satisfying in all ways and never disappointed me. Now go buy that ticket and enjoy this unique, special, and phenomenal film!", "Well, major spoiler bellow, beware I have mixed feelings towards this movie. I could have given it at least extra three points if it weren't for its cheep, underdeveloped ending! All of a sudden, Gamora, Black Panther, Falcon, Star Lord, Groot, Mantis, Drax, Dr. Strange, and Spider Man all die!! I mean, most of these characters have huge potential (BP, Dr. Strange), rising stars (Guardians of the Galaxy), and Spiderman!!! WTF?? Even their deaths were really cheap and missing sufficient drama for such a HUGE turn in Marvel's track! When Wolverine died, it took them an entire movie to develop his death story, not a few minutes of meaningless finger snap! Not to mention Loki who died in the opening scene in such an undeveloped incident What I expect, which would be even cheaper, is that some of the protagonists in the next movie will get the Time Gem and reverse the events and revive the deceased superheroes. Quite cliche'ish and cheap, if it was Overall, the movie had much much bigger potential with such a plethora of Marvel superheroes and villains. Unfortunately Marvel rushed the story to fit it into the available time slot. Splitting it into two movies, with more time and elaboration to the same story would have made it a true classic, plus a better crafted ending! Overal: Dissapointed", "To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine. However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days. But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as: Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why. Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision. Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism? Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with? Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself? Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers?  I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.", "I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles. There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its \"event\" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged. The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up. At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.", "Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection.  There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges.  Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all.  I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts.  Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does. The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve. So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea.  For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless. Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected.  The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians.  The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. \nSpiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony \"Mr. Stark\" and Tony calls Peter \"kid.\" There's a certain father-son/mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever. Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music. Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints. 1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him \"Vizz\" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.\n2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.\n3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie. Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.", "Best marvel movie yet it is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen", "Because guess what, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is a straight up porn for any fan of cin\u00e9matography. The plot is as simple, formulaic and stupid as it can get. There is a huge amount of holes, henny. The chemistry between actors (hence acting) is non-existent. All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming \"ACTION\". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need.  These \"Avengers\" might be mentally disabled: can't think OR use abilities OR communicate with each other. Well, at least they succeeded at jabbing one another with some jokes (a benevolent 1 star for this).", "The only reason I'm giving this movie a 6 and not a 3 is because of its daring script, which I might add, is WAY too heavy for children under 9. I feel sorry for parents who felt obligated to take their kids to this, because it is challenging and depressing, even for adults. There's also a fair amount of in-your-face murder, and allusions to genocide. There's so little happiness in this movie, I give the producers some points for getting it through the studio. I won't go into long machinations about the plot and characters. All of the characters are there, as far as I can tell, and it does get crowded. It's impossible to tell who has what powers at some points, since several seem omnipotent, with all manner of energy weapons. The problem with energy weapons as a plot vehicle, is that why do they even bother with learning combat? Why is an energy hammer more powerful than an energy spear? Why send packs of feral dog monsters if they can just be slaughtered? Can every single superhero breathe in space? Even Spiderman? He is aware that gravity is much reduced to swing on his webbing, right? Why does noone's hair or makeup get mussed after brutal combat, except on occasion, certain heros do get injured, stabbed, have their skin broken etc. There's absolutely no rhyme or reason to any of this, and it gets old. A few characters have mind-controlling powers as well, and that gets really hard to track. Some have novelty powers that seem as directed by the special effects department as anywhere else. The battles are relentless, and frequently devoid of all manner of scientific logic. If you can't stand watching modern video games, you don't want to see this movie, because it behaves much like one. The villain Thanos is definitely sinister, in voice and deed more than in looks, since he is a 3D construct, and I found it harder to take him seriously than the other live actors in the film. I still have no idea what Scarlet Johansson does, short of look good. She can fly around and kick things. THat's pretty useless to the other heros and villains throwing around energy bolts and space/time warping spells and weapons. For some reason, Thor has some of the most fearsome power, when he finally pulls it together in a method that is reminiscent of getting a lawn mower started, another thing which made absolutely zero sense. At times, the movie definitely feels made up as you go along, although there was a clearly defined plot that was crafted as a devilish and depressing cliffhanger, so that's the most redeeming feature. There is a good parable about sacrificing what is most important to us for ultimate power, and it is well delivered, so that's the main thing holding up this otherwise hollow picture. Big props to Zoe Saldana, for grounding and exploring the character Gamora, and bringing the best acting to a picture that doesn't leave much time for any of its big stars to do much but show up, make unfunny quips and fight. The writers were smart to give her as much dialogue as she had. Without the dynamic between her and Thanos, this picture would be nothing. I am curious to see how this predicament is addressed in the next film, since the evil fell across this movie and also Ant Man and the Wasp, but I fear that the payoff will be one drawn-out slugfest and energy weapon fest, and that, like Revenge of the Jedi, it cannot be as good as the depressing Infinity War/Empire Strikes Back tragedy flick template. This was no Empire Strikes Back however. Let's be real on that one. Let me add I'm being generous, because I'm an adult who can hack some of these comic strip films, especially the better ones like Wonder Woman. However, if you find the cliches rife in these movies intolerable, definitely stay away from this movie, because it is knee deep in many of the problems of this genre. And Tony Stark should be chasing Scarlett, NOT Pepper Pots.", "I'm probably the only fan of Super Hero Squad: Infinity Gauntlet but if you found this Avengers: Infinity War too heavy you should give it a try. Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe. Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again. Hero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.", "If this kind of a boring childish screenplay has no much popularity it is saddening. Cannot understand how anyone over the age of 20 would not get bored to death with such a lose infantile story. A lot of computer based affects but no soul and no intellect.", "Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all \"super\" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still \"clunky\" and \"solid\". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.", "Mostly the fanboys giving it 10/10 but this is just another superheroes movie. Ending is definitely unexpected which left the theatre audience speechless.", "Very visually and audibly noisy, much like Spielberg's Ready Player One, but the characters (which for the most part are already established) allow for some degree of investment. However the over-long runtime, extremely fake looking CGI, and the quantity-over-quality scale creates an overstuffed movie. The perpetual break-neck pace could work in a shorter movie but here, it just doesn't. Not to mention the whole movie feeling inconsequential when you know that half of the major characters who were \"killed off\" are coming back in the next one so any dramatic elements of Infinity War are instantly rendered nil. The most egregious flaw is that nothing about the characters really changed, they lost loved ones, but nothing about the characters themselves changed.\n5/10", "Looks like Marvel got tired from the stereotype that they never truly kill their characters and they started to swing the sword left and right. The franchize went from no death to a freaking graveyard in one movie. So Marvel tried, but still MESSED UP big time! Peace.", "With the star power and the amount of CGI and the number of great movies leading up to this, A:IW has to be the worst franchise demolition since Matrix 2 + 3... Nothing about this movie made any sense whatsoever... kill half the universe? Huh? That's a nonsense goal since it apparently only meant half the sentient beings. And even then, won't they just grow back? There were some big name actors in the film and all of them were subordinated to the CGI monstrosity that was Thanos? The CGI in this film was... Not Good At All. Flickery, incongruent, disjointed, and -- worst of all -- fakey. Finally, there was nothing about this film that makes me want to watch another Marvel movie in this iteration. I've watched all the Marvel films and several of the TV shows in this universe and not one of them was as bad as this.", "Unlike the majority of people I honestly really disliked this movie. I felt it was far to crammed because of how many characters where in it and that Thanos was not a good villian. I believe Thanos was not a good villian because the directors made him so sympathetic that I was struggling to believe that he could do the horrible things he wanted to do because one moment he'd be crying about letting Gamora die and the next moment he'd be happily planning to wipe out half the universe! Also because the decimation (Official name for the Snap) wiped out all the new characters no one is expecting the snap to be permanent so it removes the tension of what will happen next in Avengers End Name", "Great cast, entertaining movie, but... ***** Spoiler warning ********* What for a disappointing ending???\nI watched nearly every Marvel movie.\nBut that is over.", "Its a really heartbreaking great movie\nRIP Spider-Man and Black Panther", "I would rather sit in silence for 2 hours 40 minutes than watch this movie again. Seriously, why the hell are the reviews so good? All marvel had to do was to \"kill\" a few main characters?", "Way back in 2006 I paid to go see \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" and after 2 hours and 30 minutes we got to the end and was like \"wait, this is to be continued?!?!\" I never bothered with those shitty-assed movies again... Today I watched \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and realized \"well, now I never have to watch another MARVEL-assed movie again...\"", "As I do with all Marvel stuff, I've loaded it onto the tablet I keep in the bathroom. The scenes are perfectly cut for some minutes in there. And it doesn't matter if you don't remember your last visit after a day or two, there's no correlation. Wether it's shapeless, explosive, dripping, ludicrous or misleading, it always ends with the feeling that there could have been more. But even if you try harder for another minute, there's only void. And as soon as you stand up, the whole stuff is flushed out of our memory. Only persists a reminiscence of nauseating miasma.\nMankind seems to enjoy it. Well in that case, I've got a be an alien. I've decided to quit eating any fibre to never have to endure it again.", "Rarely have I seen a movie where so much is going on, but nothing is happening. Besides the typically impenetrable CGI action, you are expected to follow five plot threads at once- often waiting fifteen minutes to return to them. Heaven help you if you've missed any of the previous Marvel installments going in. You have a well-acted villain in Thanos whose motivation makes no sense. He is a galactic scale eco-terrorist who strives to cull half of the universe at random, owing to his fears of resource depletion from overpopulation. To believe the universe is in danger of overpopulation is asinine, not least because Thanos learns how to ALTER REALITY. Why slaughter so many people with a snap of your fingers, when you could make the universe more abundant instead? There's little on offer by way of genuine drama (hindered by the nagging sense that death is not permanent in a comic series transplanted to the screen). It's packed to the gills with immersion-breaking humour (because a superhero movie can't take itself seriously without being called \"grimdark\", apparently). The Hulk, for example, is reduced to one big joke about erectile dysfunction. Avengers: Infinity War is a lumbering behemoth, like a suitcase stuffed to the point its zip is breaking. The obvious conclusion to building a universe that must connect, yet be constrained to a sub three hour running time. The stakes are raised so high that \"trillions of lives\" are threatened, but the basics of film making (character development, plot, motivations, theme, pacing) are almost entirely overlooked. The movie carries no dramatic weight, and feels more like a who's who of Marvel characters. It is a Saturday morning cartoon very much brought to life, with all the associated one-dimensionality.", "Trolls sayin this is a bad movie and don't deserve this 8.9 rate. Sorry guys but I have to say it is the best superhero movie ever. The directors made no mistakes. It is just perfect. And I belive somebody doesn't like superhero movies, it is not for them. It is for the 300k people who voted 10*. Peace", "Incredible movie. This is the culmination of 10 years of intertwining story arcs. The pacing is almost perfect which is even more impressive when you think about how many characters are in this movie!! Would recommend for everyone!", "It's not a horrible movie but I don't get the point of super hero fight scenes anymore, they are just a distraction. It was kind of ridiculous Dr Strange handing over his stone at the end but at the same time it's like 'whatever, you'll get the stone anyways'. I wish the battles would have taken place in heavily populated areas so that the aimless fighting would have destroyed cities and populations. No super heros really seem to have very unique of powers or skills anymore as well, at least none that really make a tactical advantage. Guardians of the Galaxy were the best part (and probably Thor even though he was even more ridiculous) where they have at least some personality but in the end they were brought into the world of silly super hero battles.", "I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand. Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience. All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends. Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: \"We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out.\" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: \"Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl.\" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine. Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them. This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting \"MOAR.\" I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: \"This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this.\" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well. I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together. Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.", "Saw it with my family, we all loved it. Very funny, and a great cliff hanger.....", "This movie was kind of like an episode of TWD. Just a bunch of people chit-chatting with each other with boring action sequences. The premise of the movie was laughable and I'm a bit surprised that it's the best Disney/Marvel could come up with. It was like something DC/WB would come up with.", "SPOILER: The worst movie I've ever seen, all heroes dead??..... the director. U shouldn't watch it!", "This movie are so bad from all another avengers movie.\nAll movie is work in space and they get Guardians for this,so now we see they\ndont have no more ideas just copie from another movies.\nStupid film ever", "Maybe I'm just getting massive franchise fatigue but I found the moving totally borIng. The story is linear, the stakes don't seem real by foreshadowIng the fact that they can change the past, and there's a LOT of backstory they fill in to get you up to speed on all 500 marvel super hero's from their various franchises that it's hard to feel emotionally engage. The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene. Movies attain suspension of disbelief by setting and following rules. These rules seemed sloppily applied but all in all it wasn't as bad as Venom...", "Maybe if it wasn't so overrated I'd actually enjoy its CGI. Anyway, it's very monotonous and long, nothing really stands out and a twist in the end is so predictable. It pretends to be serious, but why would even bother? Jokes are so dull they make you cringe.", "I am superheroes and sci-fi fan. I have watched every single Marvel superhero movies. I found the previous ones especially the old ones like Iron man 1-3, Captain America and Thor series well-designed in story-line and also logical. But Infinity War is nothing like one of those. It felt rushed together and senseless. Each hero just \"feed\" themselves to Thanos one by one after showing off their coolest abilities. Loki as a trickster decided to go one on one face to face with Thanos. You can argue that he tried his best and didnt wanna go quietly into the night. Its heroic but also foolish and it 's simply not something loki would do in my opinion. The war happened in Wakanda. The people mastered laser surgery on infinity stone and the best shield barrier technology i have ever seen but still use spears as their main weapon. The war scene looked a lot like one of the star war movies. And the best part is they decided to open the barrier to protect Vision for his laser surgery, which didnt work at all btw. Well, if you know its Vision they are after, why dont you put the barrier around him instead of forcing to open the barrier. And where were the air support? It looks a lot cooler to go melee against melee with aliens. My dear Winter Soldier is completely useless in this movie even though he got his arm back but only knows how to shoot with M4 and keep getting one-shotted. Why not cast Ant-man instead then? Why wasting precious scene on him just because his buddy is symbol of USA? Not to mention, when Thanos at his weakest, Peter Quill who is so-called guardian of the galaxy paid no attention with the gloves which contains the most important objects in the Universe and key to winning the war but focusing on asking where his girlfriend is and wake up Thanos, who was under control of his teammates. How dare you ask \"did we lose\"? Its so ironic that Thor who had millions of combat in him 1500 year of life decided to aim his newly-made axe to the chest of Thanos. I mean did you see the shining armor he's wearing? Can you please cut his hand off or \"go for the head\" or play around with your teammates and not showing off with your weapon at last after teammates are down and lose the war. The movie is full of flaws like these. Thanos is well-fed with each one of our be-loved heroes and grew from quite strong into unstoppable. Good game and well played, guys!", "Infinity War had a lot to offer with stunning cgi that basically made the entire film apart from the heroes heads animated but done so well it looks real. The adventure the quest the ultimate event, and over ten years of waiting for the MCU to finish. Thanos really makes you question your morals... if you're twelve years old and don't understand the myth of overpopulation and genocidal tactics. The action and heros are a welcome inclusion and yeah this movie was kicka**. Not as good as Endgame but close.", "Second best film right behind Endgame. Brilliantly made and greatly acted.", "This film is better than the hype.This is one of the best movie of Marvel ever.", "That fact is that most of the bad ratings here are fake a..... Marvel fans and people who just watch movies in general not comic book or block buster films point this movie hypes you up and also breaks your heart at the sane time but it's to tell the porformance Thanos put and the actioned packed it was but overall a great one of marvel studios of not yet one of marvels greatest films of all time to be honest.", "I am an independent woman of my life please call me please please call me whenever you're ready yuyuyyyyyyy is my time please call me please please call me", "By far the best marvel film, it is so good. The most emotional marvel film to date. The battle is the best part and the parts after the battle are very emotional and after 1st time watching you really want to know what's going to happen and gets you thinking a lot. The acting is solid, visual effects are great, definitely a 10/10 especially for a marvel film.", "Avengers infinity war is a masterpiece in every way with an amazing story that is never boring, phenomenal action that's intense but also a lot of fun, amazing acting (stand outs are Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, and josh brolin), fantastic visuals, lovable and interesting characters, a great villain with thanos, hilarious comedy, gut wrenching moments, and a shocking ending. Watch it immediately.", "A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.\nIn a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.\nIt is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.\n'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.", "In fact, the main character isn't any one of our superheroes at all, but Thanos. But the movie isn't told from Thanos' point of view. Instead, Infinity War does an excellent job of explaining why thisbad guy wants to have all of the Infinity Stones. Make no mistake, he's still the enemy. However, Infinity War does such a good job that at a few parts you nod alongand say to yourself, \"OK Thanos, now I know why you want to do this.\"\nThe biggest surprise about Infinity War is how well the movie flows together. At no point is the film at all confusing. Weunderstand who is fighting whom, and what the risks and rewards are for each fight. It's not overcrowded, like one\nmight believe, even with so many heroes involved.\nScience fiction author Douglas Adams's once wrote, \"Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely ... big itis. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's , but that's just peanuts to space.\" Replace the word\"space\" with\"Avengers: Infinity War\", and you have a reasonable idea of the scope of this movie -in terms of cast, complexity, and box office revenue. Indeed, it's both big and ambitious.", "Its much better than endgame, its worth watching unlike endgame", "10 Years of Build Up wasn't wasted on this Movie. Infinity War is one of the greatest movies of all time because of how carefully they set everything else up. Stellar character growth and an incredible story make this stand out amongst the rest of Marvel. Thanos is one of the Greatest Movie Villains of all time due to the handling of his character. Everything from the beginning filled with dread of what's To come to the ending where they fulfilled their promise of dread was done perfectly. Infinity War is one of the best action movies ever made.", "I believe that Avengers : Infinity War is without a doubt the pinnacle of blockbuster entertainment (along with its sequel). Nothing quite like it has been attempted before ; and it may take a while for anything to surpass that. To this date, it is my favorite theater experience of all time. I watched it opening weekend, managed to avoid all the spoilers and contained my excitement as best as I could in the previous days. Then, the movie made me laugh, sent chills down my spine and left me shocked by the time the credits rolled. It might not be the most creative or artistic movie out there, but there is no doubt to me that it's one of the most entertaining. There is not a second of downtime during its two hours-and-a-half. Every character is given its time to shine. It is simply A-W-E-S-O-M-E. Personally, I have to agree with Martin Scorsese when it comes to Infinity War. You simply can't call this thing a movie. In reality, it is much more than that. I would call it a cultural phenomenon.", "Who doesn't love an EPIC villain?! With huge production values this was an awesome display of VFX and an epic saga of galactic proportions. The only thing plotwise is that it's totally implausible that a being with Thanos' capabilities would suffer any attack from our protags. In \"reality\" they would've been banished to oblivion long before he acquired his final gems, though I suppose he needed a few of the superheroes in his quest for the gems. I'm stoked to see how \"Endgame\" ties it all up, though I fully expect Thanos to prevail, I'll be supremely PO'ed if the producers sell us the standard Earth-heroes-must-win Hollywood ending.", "Infinity War is the pinnacle of the MCU. Out of the dozens of unique characters in the film, they managed to give each decent development. The atmosphere is perfect, displaying both the seriousness and darkness that Thanos brings while still including some good humor. Infinity War takes the action/comedy combo of the rest of the MCU but also manages to escalate the gravity of the situation. The moment Thanos sets foot on the screen, he is intimidating to audiences and heroes alike. In the end, this almost seems like a film more about Thanos than about our heroes and is a refreshing approach. Definitely one of the best superhero films ever made.", "Infinity war was a bit sloppy with its character development and story telling, but reasonably successful at jamming so many characters together and keeping it funny and mostly entertaining without making it feel like a comedy. Despite its length, the movie kept enough humor and action to keep you interested and kept the movie from dragging.", "The Marvel films are not high art, nor are they great entertainment, but they're fun for what they are: cheesy, brainless action fests with some shallow character development to make them feel like they have at least some microscopic depth. I love them, but I'm not under any delusion that they're something wonderful.\nThis film is even further from wonderful than the series has offered so far. The plot is piled high with so many concurrent stories, they all come out as underdeveloped. If you want just a hodge podge of fights and shooting, you'll love this, but there isn't much else going on, at all, and even that aspect of it is disappointing. At a certain point in the film, random Marvel characters just start showing up out of nowhere, as if they'd given up on creating a reason for them to be there.\nThe worst part of the movie is the ridiculous monster Thanos. He's unoriginal, uninteresting, and the animation of his absurd face, body, and clothing are so obviously fake, I felt like I was watching a cartoon whenever he was on screen. I didn't like him when I first saw him in Guardians: I thought he was a silly, cartoonish monster bad guy, and I was greatly disappointed that he headlined this film. Unfortunately, the goofy, kid-bate aspects of movies like Guardians and Ant Man have taken over the entire franchise because otherwise, they would have written a more interesting antagonist for this one. And what's with the beard, or the wrinkles that look like a beard; just another example of how silly Thanos is as a character.\nBe warned if you haven't seen this one: it's got a \"sad\" and rather abrupt ending. I admire them for trying to break the standard a bit, but it felt forced and unfinished because, I'd guess, the writers aren't used to having such an ending for such a film. It doesn't work, by the way.", "Finally got around to watched by this. I have a hard time deciding if this movie wants to be taken seriously or just taken as an action comedy. Peter Dinklage cast as a giant? Thor referring to a raccoon as a rabbit throughout the movie? It's so obvious that every \" death\" will be reversed via time travel in the sequel that there is no real emotional connection to the \" dead\" characters. The action scenes and visuals are great, the acting is tongue in cheek and at the the end of the day DC is a better product than the Disney characters in Marvel.", "It's amazing how differently people react to the same movie. I read the accolades this elaborate bit of silliness gets and I just don't understand it. It's a mass of dazzle in its computer graphics but with a story line for low energy morons. The story belongs in a comic book for juveniles. It's nonstop action all right but with nothing else behind it: no story, no suspense, no McGuffin. A real waste of time.", "This was a bland mashup, suitable for viewers with short attention span. Fighting and action scenes gave way to any kind of story. Oh, yes, all stories have already been told in previous movies...? \nAnd every quarter of an hour, yet another acquaintance from DC universe enters the movie. I was expecting Harry Potter and Pippi Longstocking too, but sadly no.\nSave your hard earned cash, and take your family, or someone you love for an ice cream treat. That is money better spent.", "Before I bought the tickets for this, I was amazed, to say the least, by the high ratings at this site. Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical \"good vs. evil\" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an \"apocalyptic\" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some \"plot holes\" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU. DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers", "It's a great movie and it's worth seeing. You've done well in making this movie * 10\\10", "Everyone has already shed tears over a beloved friend or family member. Nobody says anything. It is accepted by society to mourn our fellow men. But if you sit in the cinema and start to cry because your favourite character has died, the only thing that happens is that people look at you funnily. \nWhy should you mourn something that isn't real? But... Fictional characters are real.\nThe people that follow their stories make them real. \nThey are not only in the pages of books or words or sentences of their stories. \nThey are not just in the pixels on the cinema screen.\nThey are in the minds of the readers and fans too.\nThat makes them real. As a bookworm I have seen more death than a normal human being is supposed to see.\nI love to get to know new characters, really get to know them. The facts that are provided by the books or movies, are just secondary. Those are easy to figure out. The things that really matter are those which you don't see immediately. If you like a character or not, is not defined by his or her looks or how he or she speaks. It's about the details that are barely recognized, how he reacts when his mother dies, the way he looks at the woman he loves. Every character is also created through the individual ideas of every person who starts to think about the character. If a character, that you formed in your mind, has accompanied you for a few thousand pages, then the moment he or she dies is the worst thing that could happen to you. Because it isn't the death of a character, but of a friend. \nIf you read the last pages of a book and don't want to reach the end, if you rebel against the end, than the creator has done everything right.\nThe sad thing is if you do so many things right, you can do so many things wrong and spread pain easier.\nI'm not that disillusioned to say that a character's death is as cruel as a real one. No, I may dramatize, but it hurts none the less. \nMost deaths aren't just sad because they are sad, but because it may have happened out of heroic courage and you wish to act like that sometimes or because it was tragic, because of love, or because you are afraid that the same illness could be your end.  So, Marvel, I want to tell you something: You have not only ripped my heart out of my chest. No! You threw it on the ground and stepped on in!\nNot very gentlemanlike. Let me start with... the worst death of them all. \nLoki.\nMr Hiddleston, you are the very reason, why I have become a Marvel fan.\nSomething about your character fascinated me from the start. It was the moment of hesitation when faced with the destruction of New York, the fury about the betrayal of the own family and the deceptive smile when a lie was involved. He is the kind of villain, whose backstory is so well-written that you pity him. But slowly the pity was replaced with sympathy. With every movie, with every scene and with every discussion with Thor I stumbled deeper into this sympathy and I began to ask myself how it could be that the villain is more popular than the hero. I didn't find an answer except, that it must be you. \nWe both know Loki just had one wish in the bottom of his heart: to do the right thing. Just sometimes to do the right thing differed from Tony Stark's opinion or Thor's or Captain America's. But he wanted to do the right thing, for himself, for his mother, for Odin, even if he couldn't understand it sometimes and tried to hard. So much that he suffered for it, that he killed for it, that he died for it. \nI started to cry after the first five minutes of the movie and haven't stopped ever since. I have seen Loki die quite a few times now, but this time it felt so final. \nI thank you, Mr Hiddleston. You have let Loki live and let him die like he would've wanted: glorious and as a hero.\nBut not just as a hero, but as an Avenger.\nWe have a Hulk.\nIn that moment Loki was an Avenger for me, too. Tom, you have stolen a part of my heart when you took Captain America's shield. Peter Parker is so juvenile, and already so heroic. He jumped out of that bus without hesitation and flew up into space. Of course he didn't listen to Tony Stark. I must say I somehow suspected Loki's death, but your improvised \u00bbI don't want to go\u00ab scene hit me harder than a punch from the Hulk. I mean, we just got to know you (and fell a little bit in love with you) and what will aunt May say? When you were knighted as an Avenger you looked so proud and then... \nWe need our friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man! I need it! Marvel, you have already taken Loki from me, don't take Spider-Man as well. Mr Cumberbatch, I must say it's pretty unfair, that only you know the end. I don't envy you, that you had to bring so much pain to us with the direction Dr Strange took. But I do envy you for your cloak. Life is short. It can be over with a snap of ones finger. But even shorter was the reunion between Bucky and Steve. To kill Bucky once in front of Steve's eyes with his name on the lips is one thing, but twice? Well, fool me once... By the way, the beard looks great, Mr Evans. You had the most brilliant of all entrances in the Marvel history. The music was the trigger for this goose bump filled movie moment. Well done, Mr Silvestri! It was as if you wrote the main theme all those years ago just for this scene. The rest of the movie was provided with wonderful music, too. Especially Thanos had his musical highlights.  Mr Hemsworth, next time please do aim higher. Mr Pratt, I'm not going to talk to you. I will not hold the actions of your character against you either - he just lost the love of his life - but I'm still not going to talk to you.  I never expected that there would be one moment in this movie, where I would see Thanos as something else than a mad mass murderer. There was this one moment where I felt pity for him. When he killed the one thing that he loved. But this moment was over quickly, because who ever really loves, wouldn't kill for it. The simple thought would repel him. Which makes Gamora's sacrifice even more tragic. After this second of pity I understood that her death didn't happen out of love, but out of lust for power by a monster. There were good, no great, moments too. Like every time Thor called Rocket a rabbit (well, rabbit is at least more accurate than fox) or Dr Strange and Tony discussed something and you asked yourself, which one demands Watson first. \nGenerally when a narcissistic smart-arse, an arrogant genius and an ironic space criminal had a scene together and tried to save the universe, of course it had to go wrong. \nI don't know if I find Rocket's idea of stealing Bucky's arm incredibly hilarious or just suicidal. \nSurprisingly I wished to be a nano particle of Tony's suit just to see something that beautiful up close. \nThere is only one explanation for Tony's fathers feelings: Peter. He had a suit for that boy on alert, maybe even for weeks and then the first thing he does is to assure that Peter is safe. It didn't work that well, but if Tony doesn't get the chance to marry Pepper and have kids with her (and make Peter the godfather) then... I can't even say that it will break my heart... it already has.\nMr Downey jr., you're the beginning of the MCU, please make sure that its end, especially the end of certain heroes, will not come too soon.  Let's talk about all the strong and wonderful women in this movie! Shuri can beat you up easily while she lists all the decimal places of pi. Not only Shuri but General Okoye is a picture of feminism. \nWanda made the biggest progress in my opinion. She became aware of her own strength, her powers and her feelings. She takes responsibility, but has to carry pain too. To kill the man you love... not everybody can do that.\nNatasha is Natasha. I think there is nobody who has a drier sense of humor than her. \nGamora has the most tragic end, but I think it is great that the relationship between her and Thanos was explained and why she became one of the key characters of the movie.  I asked myself if it wasn't just a crossover between all the Marvel movies, but if there was a little bit of Harry Potter (I wanted to cast a Patronus on Red Skull), Star Wars (the space ships with those creatures looked a lot like star destroyers to me) and Lord of the Rings (I somehow felt strongly reminded of the Hobbit when Thor was in the forge) mixed in as well. A lot characters didn't get their fair share, but even I can see that it would have been difficult to give every one his entitled screen time. Especially with the discussion that this would cause between the golden trio of \u00bbmy plan is better than yours\u00ab. Where as it would've shortened the waiting time until the next movie gradually. I cannot quite put into words how this movie made me feel. \nEmpty, worn down, infinitely sad, betrayed.\nBut I left the cinema with a spark of hope, although, with tears in my eyes but hopeful.\nFor Thanos, the sun rose in the end. It will shine for the Avengers again, too. \nFor Bucky, Sam, Groot, Mantis, Drax, Peter, T'Challa, Wanda, Dr Strange, Gamora, Vision, Spiderman and Loki.\nI am sure about that. There will be a new start, that is what the sunrise stands for, right?\nFor something new.\nMaybe we have to live with the fact that it will be different now, that it will not be like before.\nWe have to trust Dr Strange. It had to be like this, there was no other way. But this sunrise shows us that even the darkest hours will end.\nIn the end there was a ray of hope. \nAnd light will always banish the darkness.\nAs Loki said: \u00bbI assure you, brother, the sun will shine on us again.\u00ab Dear Avengers,  you are our light and we will carry your light onward even when you cannot, when you are parted and torn apart by grief. \nThe moment on the last page has not come yet. \nWe can turn the page now and begin a new chapter. \nBecause you are our light.\nAnd this light will never go out.\nDo you know why? Because it is real.", "SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much.  The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista).  The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.", "Why does everyone think this movie is so good.

It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why. All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed.

Great for Marvel Fans with all the characters coming together in just one movie. The Movie was spectacular with the special effects etc. but is it just me, it was the most disappointing ending to a movie i have ever seen. Its like it stopped 10 minutes before the real end of the movie. i still have not got a clue what was going on at the end.  I think this is a movie for Marvel Fans who follow the Marvel movies and the plot. but for the casual movie goer, i found it a weird and total strange end to a movie, where it leaves you thinking what the hell, one minute you are watching it and then it just ends in bizarre without explanation. I assume they did this ready for the next movie in the serious. but non the less leaves you deflated after watching all the way through.", "The infinity war is about constant fight and That's it.

But I do like a lot of special effects and I do like to have fun while watching this kind of movies. However, you can easily skip this one. It is the worst part in the MCU series. People giving more the 5 stars just for the special effects? C'mon. This not how it is supposed to work.", "This thing dragged along. Didn't know half the characters. Wish I'd have saved my money.", "I have loved Marvel....but this movie is just stupid...crying Hulk? Seriously? I'm still angry after watching the movie...and has been days now. New-age ending...bah....can't even bother to write anything...I just hated the movie...period", "I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.\nThe HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos \"plan\" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just \"magic\" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize \"a steak\" to the size of a \"truck\" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.\nAlmost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?\nLet's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!\nHeimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.\nGamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.\nAliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and \"bargain\" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a \"plan\" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?\nCaptain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the \"mirror dimension\"? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way.

This film was worth waiting 10 years. Although the movie is 2.5 hours long, it was not boring. Every scene was action packed and detailed. In fact, you definitely need to watch it at least once because there is a bit too much information going on.  Thanos was a great villain. He was scary yet likable. You can see his emotional side especially with Gamora. Of course, no movie is perfect. Thor was overpowered, probably because of his newfound powers in Ragnorak and stormbreaker. I didn't like that Captain America had a smaller role than normal. Additionally, I'm sure Hulk had a minor role here for a reason. Like in Civil War, Vision was mostly useless as well. I get that he was stabbed earlier in the movie, but he still could have done more.  Some people do not like that half the universe \"died,\" including the heroes. However, I enjoyed that the ending was not a cliche of the hero always winning. People need to understand that this movie was originally supposed to be in 2 parts. \"Part 2\" should have all the answers when it comes out next year.", "Here is the series dark episode, it will go down in cinema history as The Empire Strikes Back of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a loss of such greatness that all others that follow only have one way to go, up..", "My husband and I have loved sci-fi movies for 30++ years. This is the first time we left a sci-fi movie feeling depressed. To have the bad guy win and half of the heroes die (not to mention half of everyone else in the universe) was extremely disturbing. Now don't get me wrong, we are not weirdos who expect life to be perfect. But, this ending was very shocking, which others obviously enjoyed. Evidently there is another film coming out (hopefully with a better ending), but not for some time. The good news - we loved the special effects and the acting. - this I would give 10 stars.", "Who wants to go to a movie when they feel worse at the end than they do when they come in? The ending ruins the film and tries to hook you into seeing part 2. I will wait until it makes it to the small screen. I won't lay down good money to feel bad. Nice effects but storyline just sucks. I can't believe all the high ratings.", "This review represents more than just infinity wars. This review applies to every marvel movie ever made. Why I hate marvel movies\nMarvel represents everything wrong with movies from this generation .The marvel universe started off strong in 1944 with captain America which for the time was incredible. Than they started making movies that were aimed at adults such as the Blade trilogy and of cause the punisher which might I add I actually enjoyed. But than the sequels began to this day in 2018 marvel have filmed over 80 movies with an average of 9 movies every 2 years. If this doesn't show marvels true intentions than I don't know what will. Marvel is the most soulless repetitive money motivated film company of all time at this point you are literally paying for the same movie with a different repetitive costume 80 times 5 times a year. let's say you pay $10 for a ticket for every hardcore fan they have wasted $800 of there money times that by about 20 million fans you got $1600000000 going to a terrible franchise that just keeps ripping people off over and over. Than using money and theatre time that could be going to actual good movies. For example Quentin Tarantino's the hateful 8 was postponed for a later released because non other than marvel desided that they wanted to release there film a few weeks earlier. If movies watchers keep supporting these high budget plotless pointless repetitive garbage movies that keep Dwayne Johnson and marvel in business in a few years there won't be any good movies being made. Than we will all be thinking back to the 90s and mid 2000s when movies weren't money making trash and actually had plots and were more than a few good action sequences wondering what happened. The fact that avengers infinity wars is 49th place on the top 250 is disgusting and shows how close we are to the good movie irreversible apocalypse. There are a few good directors left and unfortunately they are getting old and only release 1 movie per few years such as Quentin Tarantino Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. But lucky for us it's not to late just stop buying tickets and merchandise for marvel DC and any pointless action or dumb Adam sandler or Amy Schumer comedy and we might be able to save this planet from the great film Death.", "Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.", "Wonderful graphics, intriguing story, strong acting, but some of the cheesy jokes are making these movies less than laughable... Of all the comics I read in the 60s and 70s, I don't recall any emphasis on laughs... I love a joke as much as the next guy, but it's hard to take a comedic line seriously... Still, a great show and I'll be long anticipating to learn where it goes now... Though it seems readily apparent!", "Excellent!! Marvel and the Russo Brothers have out done themselves! Can't wait for the follow up next year. Best in the MCU to date!", "Do Not Go See \"Avengers Infinity War\" IF You Want to See the Ending of the movie!!! The Ending is in the sequel: May 3, 2019!!! It's a dirty little trick that I think will reduce the otherwise grandiose profits. Marvel, this was an unwise move. Word will spread. Now people will be overly cautious about your movies. Serial cliffhangers went out with Edison, the Weiss Brothers, and Flash Gordon.", "Even if I overlook the Witzelsucht - the lame, inane attempts at humor - there are many other reasons to dislike this movie. Instead of expending the effort to portray the hulk longer than one moment, it actually upscales a little person. WTF? I will never pay to see another Marvel production!!", "Peter Quill was a competent, somewhat stupid and impulsive, character to begin with but he was not mentally handicapped. People praise The Russo Brothers for this film, even going as far as to say that this film is the \"best superhero movie ever.\" That is not true and if you're too blind to see that this movie was worse than Age of Ultron, which comparably was pretty bad itself, but this takes the cake and you shouldn't watch, or rate, superhero movies. Don't for a moment think that Avengers: Endgame will be any better. When you write a film so full of plot holes that it may as well have been filmed through a cheese grater, you should not be praised as great directors, or even called writers at that point either. You should be bent over the knee and spanked and then scolded for writing, and directing such a bad movie. I've never uttered these words before but Ang Li's Hulk with Eric Banna was better than this film.", "Boring, plot makes no sense, characters make stupid choices, nothing is explained well.

OK, Thanos is all powerful, but he beats Hulk with a few punches and knees. At least make the fight big. The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes. In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy. Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening. The movie made a lot of money - a lot of people love the Emperor's new suit.", "So many plot holes and plot contrivances, can't believe audiences are this stupid, posibly even dumber than the moronic heroes in this movie", "Marvel movies are just micheal bays transformers with jokes. I think infinity war might be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Nothing resembling believability in any second of the film, boring dialogue, a total excess of forgetable characters. The physics is terribly inconsistent, the cgi bad, the characters are boring. The action is just like a transformers movie, just pointless things moving around. Not only dull, but cringeworthy.", "Moral of this movie is: 1. Yes, kids, evil CAN win! 2. There are no more heroes to save you from the evil. They can die, and Hulk is a wuss! 3. Logical resolution of world's over-population and hunger is, of course, a genocide! Great job, people... Next Hollywood hit: Thanos against Merry Poppins and Peter Pan, blood and gore included... Rubbish.", "It were oceans of commercials, trailers, talks... Never before sawn effects... Numerous stars playing... Lots of characters... Epic, you would say... One would say: Why Thanos did nothing to conquer the universe decades ago? What was he waiting? He got those stones to easy. No one could have got in his way... Even Hulk scared? Please, dear MCU bosses, drop Disney writers... This is NOT the CARTOON!!! PLEASE MAKE IT RIGHT!!!! I will continue this review after cooldown...", "It was a much hyped movie for me. However it didn't live up to my expectations. It seemed to me that avenger team was loosing the battle with \"Thanos\" deliberately and intentionally so that \"Thanos\" can be dragged for another installment of this franchise.There were so many scenes where nothing made sense. It all felt like the director wanted avengers to loose .Even Hulk cried like a baby and never showed up after getting ass kicked by Thanos. Dr Strange had control over time but he didnt use it rather he handed over the stone to Thanos. Loki died like he never existed.Galaxy girl didnt want Thanos to find her so she took a smart move and went straight to him.Her Boyfriend who was about to shoot her himself, woke Thanos up while other team members were about to take the source of his power just to know the whereabouts of his lost girlfriend.Thor knew that thanos's power source was his gauntlet so instead of aiming at the gauntlet he aimed for his chest so that he can live and kill all others.. Spider man who is a superhero and always ready to give up his life to save humanity was crying at the arms of Iron man saying \"I don't wanna die\".Vision who was one of the most powerful super hero kept other super heroes busy to save his own ass instead contributing to the greater cause.Other than all these, everything was awesome!!", "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once. I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his \"daughter\" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end. Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt's character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don't need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film \"Logan\". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.", "Infinity War was brilliant, and don't worry even though it has more than 50 characters they all get their moments it was so much fun watching them fight all together and even though the title says Avengers, it's clearly a THANOS movie, and probably the best character in this film and has the most screen time, and Josh Brolin did an amazing job on portraying Thanos. The character development is great, except for the children of Thanos which disappoint me a little bit cause they didnt have that much development and screentime but that was expected since there's a lot of characters in this film. CGI was great! it almost feel like it was real. there are some scenes that feels like there's too much going on, and like moving to different scenes or places but overall the action sequences were amazing\nand even the movie is just 2 and half hours, it didnt feel like it was. the movie is just so brilliant and emotional, 10 years of hard work. it paid off.\nthe ending was definitely shocking, it'll leave you speechless and the post credit scene will make you so much more excited in the future film of mcu", "Explosions, eplosions and more explosions and then it ends in drama, that you don't care At All, because the characters are given so little time and so few lines, it's shamefull. No, wait. It's actually shameless treating storytelling like that.\nWhy did they spend all this money on this hopeless scipt?\nI was bored so much, I left mid-movie, went to get something to eat and got back. And I didn't really miss anything.\nCountless plot holes, nonsensical vilain and the heroes doing constantly things contrary to their character and abilities. And don't anybody dare say these are character arcs, because they are not. If nothing else, they start from the very first scene. \nUsually I'm patient with superhero movies. They are supposed to be light and fun, so many sins are forgiven without second thought. I'm sorry, this was unforgivable.And not fun. At All.", "My fav Marvel character is there for like a minute. Its dissapointing.", "I'm a huge fan of the MCU, and the past few movies have been incredible. The build up to this movie was unprecedented, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype. There were a few funny moments, and the characters had equal and balanced amounts of screen time. However, that's where any positive comments I could make about this movie end. Every plot line that had been built in the last phase of movies was destroyed in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Some of the romantic subplots seemed to come out of nowhere or at the very least lacked significant, on-screen build up. One of the worst things about the movie was how easy it was for Thanos to find the infinity stones. It was so easy to collect them, anyone could have done it. Thanos could have done it ages ago. Why wait for something that was so simply accomplished? From what the movie shows us, he finds them in a matter of days, with only one stone posing any real challenge to find. Thanos also lacks real motivation as a character. He doesn't desire any acknowledgment, any material possession, or any power for wiping out half the universe. It felt like something pivotal to the story had been removed (which, from my understanding of the comics, was actually the case). It also seemed pretty convenient that at the end of the movie, the heroes left standing were the same boring, dried up characters whose stories were long over before this movie (looking at you, Iron Man). I've been following these movies for a long time, and the other Avengers movies were disappointing, but this was the last straw for me.", "If you like watching essentially the same movie being re-released every 4 months with a different character in a slightly different colour of spandex going through the exact same story arch as the last hero in an incredibly repetitive formulaic experience, then this is for you...\nIf you like original, thought provoking movies that test you're senses and deliver new experiences, with strong well built characters, unique stories, excellent acting and ground-breaking directing... Then you won't like this.\nAnother year, another endless array of comic book movies; there's a reason non of them never get nominated for best picture & it's not a good one.", "If you love CGI and special effects, I think Marvel did a fine job. Other than that, it did not live up to it's hype, at least for me. I felt the entire movie was science vs sorcery and the latter won...for now. By the way, I loved all the previous Marvel super hero movies. WARNING: FULL SPOILERS AHEAD \nSPOILER:There seem to be no coherency with other Marvel super hero movies (although it was supposed to be) and with too many plot holes. It felt like the movie was everywhere and nowhere at the same time. A lot of scenes didn't make sense if you have watched previous Marvel super hero movies. This movie makes some of the super heroes a lot weaker and some a lot stronger for no apparent reason except to enable Thanos to wipe out half the Universe.  The movie starts of with a decimated Asgardian spaceship. Where was Hulk and Valkyrie when this happened? Sure, Hulk pops up just before Loki hands over the Tesseract. The strongest Avenger is no match for Thanos. What? Seriously? I get it. Thanos is something like 10x stronger than Hulk even without the infinity gauntlet. But come on? Did they just do that to make a short scene before Heimdall transports Hulk to Earth? I felt it's such a waste that Hulk doesn't appear in the entire movie after this scene. Loki. Isn't he the god of mischief? Why didn't he just clone himself or appear as a hologram of himself like he did in the first Avenger movie or in Ragnarok? Where did his powers go? Thor: Is he only powerful with his weapon? I remember in Ragnarok when Odin said Thor is powerful even with his hammer, the Mjolnir. And he took on Hela and her army without a weapon. Later in this movie, Thor is blasted with the force of a supernova, during the process of making the Storm Breaker and he survives, although badly bruised and battered. My point is if Thor has such powers to withstand the force of a supernova, why couldn't he leave a scratch on Thanos during the attack on the Asgardian ship?  Bruce Banner: Remember in the first Avenger movie during the battle of New York when Bruce tells Steve Rodgers \"Captain, that's my secret. I'm always angry\"? What happened now? When he couldn't turn into Hulk, why didn't Tony Stark just shoot him or roll him under a bus or push him off a building like how Black Widow did in Age of Ultron? That would have turned him into Hulk for sure, wouldn't it?  Bruce Banner is funny but he is not a comedy actor. Too bad Marvel turned him into one in this movie long with Tony Stark to a certain extent. Proxima Midnight. If you know how powerful she is and the spear she holds (created from a star trapped in a quantum singularity), there is no way in hell Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon could have beaten her and Corvus Glaive. Here, Marvel makes these 3 super heroes way more powerful than they are. I think Scarlet Witch has more powers to take down these 2 villains. Sadly, they portray her as a weaker super hero in this particular scene. Don't even get me started on Vision's apparent weakness. He's supposed to be made of Vibranium and fly through solid objects as shown in Civil War, right? Did he leave those powers at home? Is Titan's atmosphere (nitrogen with methane and ethane clouds) breathable? Let's send Matt Damon to find out. Oh wait, Marvel has already sent Peter Parker, Tony Stark and Dr. Strange. Apparently, you can breath.  Hulk is the strongest Avenger. If Thanos is 10x stronger than Hulk and can knock him out with a few punches, I'm sure one punch from him would kill any of Earth's other super heroes. Even with his Iron Man suit on, you'd think Tony Stark wouldn't stand a change. Well, you'd be wrong. And to add insult to injury, even Captain America can survive a punch from Thanos, with just a bloodied nose. Really Marvel? If Marvel wanted to keep Steve Rodgers and Tony Stark for the next Avenger movie, the punch scene was really unnecessary as it does not serve justice to Thanos' strength. Oh and by the way, the new Iron Man suit is just freaking awesome. Tony Stark definitely can take out Thanos (without the infinity stones of course) with it. But why was it so difficult to pull out the gauntlet from Thanos' arm is beyond me. Credit roll: Did I see the names of the guys who mows the lawn and cleans the pool for Kevin Feige's and the Russo brother's vacation homes? I sure felt like I did. (Hint: It took that long to show the post credit scene). Spoiler: With Spider-man, Black Panther, Star Lord and Dr. Strange wiped out from the Universe, I guess these super heroes related movies will be coming out after Avengers 4!", "This movie was slow paced and tied together with improbable coincidences, like getting the soul stone, Thanos needed to sacrifice the one thing he loves, let it be that that thing was standing besides him, how convenient! Other than Black Panther and warriors from Wakanda, but it shows more the often that The Avengers and the Marvel Universe lack diversity and is white privileged. It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor, a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end! The ending however is a cheap shot for a second installment.....", "How in the world thid movie get a rating of 9 imdb.

Cmon really? It is a slightly above average marvel movie, that's it.", "....he will win 100% Oscar for the worst scenario and for the worst director", "MAJOR SPOILERS!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM! My headline is the easy way to describe this movie. It is grand, majestic and spectacular. Just like Thanos towering everyone else with his physique this movie also stands above everything else, at least most of it. Because wow, this movie is really something to behold. Marvel went all in with everything here, the cgi is phenomenal, the acting is great, the story is well told, the pacing is near perfect. I have seen this movie twice in IMAX 3D and once in 4DX now, and i have never seen a movie with better image quality than this one, never. Ever since the MCU started with Iron Man i have seen every film released, most of them are good, some are outright great, a few are mediocre and very few are bad. But for the most part it has been a hell of a ride, and I've eagerly been awaiting this movie for quite some time, we all knew that it would come down to this, but were you prepared for what would be the outcome? Not many were, though many of us knew several avengers and other major characters would die in this film, i did not expect it to be this many. This movie truly didn't waste any time getting down to business, as before ten minutes had passed, Heimdall and Loki are killed, and we see the Titan kick the crap out of Hulk, this set the tone for the entire movie right of the bat, and was IMO a smart move, now we knew for sure what a badass Thanos is, and this was before he got all the stones. What the Russo brothers have done here is to overdo themselves. Winter Soldier and Civil War are two of the best MCU movies to date, and you got to wonder how Marvel found these guys, and knew what they were capable of, because Infinity War just lifted the bar even higher. This movie is sort of Michael Bay's wet dream, this is what he wants to achieve, but never can because he has no idea how to tell a story or handle emotions. This movie is a 2 hour and 30 minute spectacle, which has action scene after action scene lined up, and it never feels too much, somehow they managed to balance it, and that is a feat not many directors can pull off. But also the music is masterfully composed, and fit every scene perfectly. And the costumes and props design are state of the art, everything looks and feels so right in this film, all the people involved has done an outstanding job. And i really have to give it to Josh Brolin. Thanos is easily the best villain i have seen in quite some time. He is a complex villain, that is so well portrayed i almost start rooting for him, and that is saying something come to think how many years i have grown to love the avengers and the guardians. This is also big thanks to the amazing cgi that just brings so much life into the character. I can understand his motivations, i can side with his thoughts, i both agree and i disagree at same time. Such a great character, easily the best MCU villain so far, and i had Loki as my favorite before him. At the end when Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Scarlett Witch, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Mantis, Bucky Barnes and many others are killed because he gets all the stones, i both felt a sense of pride for Thanos completing his mission, he truly is a determined badass. But at the same time i felt great sadness that so many of the characters that i loved, are dead. But MCU has killed characters before, which has been brought back to life, so i guess that will be the case here as well, as the next movie most likely will deal with time travel and fight Thanos in the future and the past. Dr.Strange gave up the time stone because of the 14.000.605 outcomes that he saw, only one lead to victory for the avengers, and giving up the stone was the beginning of the victory path. So even though this movie ended on a cliffhanger, it left enough hints that will be talked about for a whole year, and it will build the biggest hype in the history of cinema. So at the end of the day, this movie just delivers on so many levels, and it will make way for the rise of many new characters to enter the MCU, and finally take down Thanos and undo some of the damage he has done. It's quite amazing that this movie actually managed to live up to the hype, that should not even be possible when you think about it, but it did. The movie is absolutely amazing. I can't wait for Avengers 4.", "I don't know how this movie IMDB High Rank. This is the very very very bad movie i have ever seen.\nThis movie have no plot and story.\nOthers marvel comic movie best then Averagers infinity war. Don't wast your valuable time in your life Believe me.", "If you are gonna watch this then do not waste your money, make it free, it is not worth \u00a315 or $19. The whole thing was a big CGI fight and bored me to hell. Thanks Marvel. Thanks.", "I wanted so much to like this film but for me it came out as too knowing, self referential and repetitively dull.\nMark Ruffalo seems to have changed his character for the worst, Chris Prat/The Guardians of the Galaxy are beyond annoying and several others are badly under used. Also for me Thanos was too human.", "I was disappointed. Normally Marvel produces very great movies however this one was a flunk in my opinion, to much was jammed all at once into it and not only that there was just not enough detail to storyline such as previous Avenger movies.", "Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc.....  To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation.  The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster). I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early. To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.", "Another Marvel cgi stupid movie with dull dialogue, idiot characters and jokes about sex that i hate it.\nPointless, stupid and cheesy violence and the cast is awful.\nI didn't like it.

And thankfully it didn't. The movie delivered what was expected from it.Full paced action with CGI as a visual spectacle.And the anti climax was a bit of a gamble which paid off perfectly.I would have given it a 9 if not for the unnecessary misplaced humor,which the directors are still refusing to let go.", "I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long.  With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense. It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.", "Have you ever watched a movie where even if you already set the speed to 1.3, you still can't stop yourself to forward it 5-20 seconds time to time? I just did. I even read positive reviews to convince myself that the film is good but nothing worked. Don't get me wrong. I know, and I am very much familiar with MCU. I liked it, in fact, even if the whole plot is cliche. The whole movie is just a 2- hour fan service thus the lack of storytelling. But, of course, this would be not an issue for Marvel since the viewers watch the film only for the sake of seeing their favorite characters come to life (even with slight inaccuracies) and knowing (not figuring out because every Marvel film is shallow) what would happen at the end of the film. Thus, it is also the case that if the viewers already knew what will happen in the film, the film will lose its value. This is pretty simple. Every important part of this film is just a collection of discrete information. Watching this film felt like reading a bullet outline. There's no transition. No emotions to fill those gap--which something I believe a good movie should have. The supposed catharsis should have happened during the whole disintegration moment, like really? How cringey is that? This film is a mosaic. Most of the plot-turning moments in the film are unsubstantiated. I would bet even the Marvel fan themselves observed some moments in the film where they would react: how did that happen. The script made the film into a clown fiesta. This film is more like a parody. A highly budgeted parody is a crap.", "I'm tired of superhero vs superhero fighting.\nI like Stark and focus on development.\nSuperheroes don't die ... but please let them be dead this time.\nI don't think Marvel can afford letting them die..", "I spent many of hours reading comics in my early years and watched television try to bring some characters to life. tho i was excited as Spiderman, Captain America & the Punisher got shots at entertaining the viewers, we were never in awe of the special effects available today. and here we are 40 some years later, the characters have been squeezed into a few hours of viewing. superheroes with identities that the whole universe recognize (oh yeah, they show peter parker keeping his identity hidden - from his aunt, everyone else can know, just not his aunt) when i heard Marvel was creating the screened universe, the possibilities of where we cold explore only to watch how they have transformed into an unstable mass of special effects to glorify production companies, i guess the only reason i watch them anymore is to see Stan Lee at least participate in the products he founded", "Okay, so the movie was really good in a sense that it provided action and cool things to look at. But what really makes this not as good as people say it is is the frickin logic in it. Ok i get it, it's a movie, movies don't have to be realistic, but goddamn look at all the heroes in this movie and with the way Thanos was portrayed he could've achieved his goal in half an hour if he tried or did something logical but instead he decided to \"take his time because he knows he'll win\" and because of that many of the heroes could have beat thanos themselves like thor at the very end could have cut thanos's arm off ending the movie right there, or doctor strange who had many many many opportunities to do things could've used the stone, or cut thanos' arm off with his portal, and wong, who literally showed up for 3 minutes could've appeared at wakanda and yeeted the enemies into the mirror dimension instead of causing a great battle between human and alien. Like so much of this movie is unnecessary that it just ruins it once you look back.", "The ending left everyone wondering what they had just wasted 2 hours of their life on. The first half was very good!", "If you are not a fan, don't watch it. I nearly fell asleep at the middle of the film.", "I have my life dedicated to marvel. I have watched it grow for 10 years and will continue to watch it for another 10 years after Avengers 4. \nThis movie is directed by the Russo brothers, who directed some of the best marvel movies, including captain America winter soldier and civil war. And it stars everyone basically. And in this movie, The Avengers, still torn apart after the events of Civil war, team up with the guardians of the galaxy to stop thanos from getting all the infinity stones and wiping out half of the universe. Warning spoilers!!! So let's talk about the opening, with the deaths of Loki and heimdall. I feel like their deaths really set the tone the film was aiming at. Now this movie is really funny as well. There are jokes to really lighten down the dark tone this movie had. But this is still a really dark film overall, and the directors really show that. The action in this movie had no shaky cam for like 99% of the time, and it is glorious. This movie is epic and has mind blowing action. I also really love how everyone who meets up interacts with each other. They put all these characters in a film and they made it work really well. Like I did not expect it to work this well. \nLet's talk about Thanos. He is....horrifying. At first I was a little nervous and thought they were going to give him the stephenwolf treatment. But thankfully, they didn't. He is the big baddy they have been building up for more than 6 years, and they pulled it off. Thanos is one of the most powerful villains Marvel has seen, so there are actual stakes for our hero's. And that scene where he throws gamora off the cliff is heartbreaking and just proves how far he is willing to go to get what he wants. But also shows he has sympathy and sometimes regrets the decisions he makes. \nNow the cliffhanger kinda of pissed me off, but also excited me. It ends with thanos wiping out half the universe, including most off the guardians, half of the avengers, and the Wakandan armies. I hated to see some of the characters I've grown to love dissolve into nothing but dust. But it also really sets expectations for the next film. Anyway, this movie is my favorite marvel movie so far. Emotional, exciting, and funny, Avengers Infinity war does not disappoint. I am going to give it a 9.5/10", "It has good action, A lot of emotion, a lot of suspense, a lot of surprises, this movie was just awesome. \nIts also awesome to see the guardians of the galaxy meet the avengers!\nAlso Thanos is an amazing villian!", "All I can say that is I'm not satisfied with the movie\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI need to watch it again 500 times", "This movie made me cry my eyes out and watch my favorite super heroes, Vision, Spider Man, Star-Lord, Doctor Strange, and literally half of the Marvel universe but good movies make you feel emotion. It was very well done but at the very end Captain Marvel is given a cameo! I hate Captain Marvel so a lot of others will say otherwise but she really just sucks.", "SPOILER: At the end when Thanos gets all of the infinity gems, most of the heroes break into particles like a blender 3D breaking vase animation that was sloppily made! I hope someone goes back in time to change the script to give this a better ending!", "Everything about this movie had me so hyped and i thought it was amazing until the ending rolled around. All i can think about is having to watch all of my favorite characters disintegrate, I cant even look back at the movie and think \"wow that was a fun movie the visuals were great and the action was super well choreographed \" because the main thing that sticks in my head now is Thanos at the end in his little retirement hut looking proud of himself for killing everyone. I am beyond pissed at infinity war. I cant believe whoever had the idea to show Spider-man crying as he disintegrates saying how he doesn't wanna die to a bunch of kids. and I did see a lot of kids in that theater. If i was a young kid watching this movie i think i would be depressed for weeks. I'm depressed the next day after watching it an I'm an adult for heavens sake. I only feel like giving all the amazing parts of the movie one star because none of it seems like it matters now. I personally hate this edgy fatalistic defeatist idealism that's sweeping through media. nothing shows it better than the ending of this movie.", "If you enjoy watching half a movie that ends right in the middle of the action with a genocidal bad guy who is portrayed as a sympathetic character who stomps every single hero into the ground and wins completely then this is the film for you.", "The hype of this movie has been .. enormous ... and then they cr-p out this from their b-hind.

Was the director not taking ADHD meds? Lol sorry... but still!!!! The movie was literally ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!!!!!!! Whiplash from trying to keep up with that jumbled mess.....", "Compared to Justice League's Steppenwolf, the main villian is a bit more fleshed out. What doesn't help is, that his motivation and plan are super dumb if you think about it. The execution also doesn't make much sense. The story is full of cliches and non-sensical plans and most dead people surely will return soon again. This movie is 90% CG, some of it very bad and I could believe of even the soulless script was computer-generated", "This movie lacks the magical Joss Whedon touch. The witty repartee just wasn't there. Thanos was supposed to be an ambivalent \"monster\", but seemed too melancholy and uncommitted to his choices. Joss is the master of bipolar multiple personality disorder villians and hero's alike. Some of the characters just weren't selling it.", "I have seen every crazy movie in this crossover series, and I am now done.  This was too dark, WAY to slow, and disjointed beyond belief.  Enjoyed Deadpool 2 much better which I saw last week when I couldn't get seats for Infinity Wars. I can't understand how word of mouth would bring people in to see this drivel.  As always, we sat thru the credits which unfortunately showed more of the same coming.", "Ok, I know there will be a sequence... and if is so bad as this one I don't wanna watch!!\nI like superhero movies as entertainment, but some, like Dr. Strange, have something more... The first Avengers was so boring that it was the first movie I slept almo all over... This one I didn't, but now I think it'd be better if I did...\nOf course I hated that everyone that matters died, but, it wasn't just that, this was only the rotted cherry of one big bad cake! \nThe worst part was that everyone who had great power did the opposite of what they use to do, and here is the inconsistency.... Worse, we're subjected to a farce, where Thanos can pulverize the Hulk and Thor (who has chosen to not use lightning for no apparent reason at all) in 3 seconds, but Captain America can hold his fist open for nearly ten seconds. \nWhere Dr. Strange absolutely no, sorry but, cannot, ever, hand over that time-stone, but apparently sees no particular need to jump back in time and maybe reverse being on that ship in the first place? (Maybe even *gasps* turn back time until Starlord does not punch Thanos in the face? Or, why not trap Thanos in the sort of time-loop he used last time at the end of his movie? If I, a plebeian audience, can think of this, why can't Strange?).\nWhere everyone tries to pull off Thanos' glove, and no one thinks of putting his arm through one of those yellow-Strange-portal thingys and chopping said arm off, which we know worked perfectly well on Thanos' kid. \nWhere Loki, who can survive falling off the Bifrost and through space, apparently decides trying to stab Thanos with a dagger makes more sense than taking Thor and jumping out a window and letting the vacuum of space kill everyone on Thanos' side who *can* be killed by that, since it's been a fact since he fell off the Bifrost that both he and Thor are immune to dying in space. \nWorse!!! Where Heimdall teleports Hulk back to earth, because apparently Hulk is more important than the King??? I will not even get started on poor Steve, Wanda, and Vision's arcs, or Starlord's. All I will say is that it IS trading lives if you trade 10,000 foot-soldier's lives for one Vision, and Starlord might be shallow but he DOES have a brain. That\u00b4s why if the second part keeps this pace of this bad, bad plot... I'll never more watch one movie of this franchise.", "I am a big fan of Marvels, but this movie was a crushing disappointment. The effects was great, and......... that's it. \nThe movie made no sense, you'll be mostly trying to figure out what's going on even after it's done. What a disappointment!! It honestly hurts.\nAfter watching Black Panther, I was so pumped up, looking forwards to watching this film, just to get a smashing let down!\nI'm actually afraid of watching the next Avengers. SO crushing it is! OUCH!!", "This film is fine, but it doesn't deserve all the 10s. It's definitely not one of the top 10 films of all time.", "No history, too many heroes, and nothing with sense.\nMarvel has no writers", "***SPOILERS AT THE BOTTOM*** The good:\n-The film should be commended on managing to make a watchable film that brings together characters from the previous Avengers films, both Guardians films, Black Panther and Doctor Strange. It could have been a complete mess and thankfully it wasn't.\n-Thanos is possibly the best MCU villain so far, although I know that isn't saying much. He had clear motivations, conflicts, personality, you know, all the things that go into a good character. He wasn't generic bad guy #7.\n-As expected the film was pretty funny. Most of the jokes landed. The bad:\n-Although the film wasn't a mess, there were a fair few characters that did almost literally nothing. Kinda understandable when you have 35 or so characters but even so, it is still a negative.\n-There was no single clear driving force in terms of plot. Instead we had three different groups of characters doing their own thing, and occasionally meet one of the other groups.\n-Tonally it was kinda like watching two films at once, largely due to the integration of the Guardians characters with the Avengers.\n-This film features a faceless CGI army for the heroes to dismember. ***SPOILERS BELOW***\nSPOILER: And my biggest problem with this film is the ending. Throughout the film there are three characters (should have been four!!) that die and it is very clear that they are actually dead and Marvel isn't going to bring them back. They die for a reason. At the end of the film however, probably half the characters from the entire film die. So the way I see it is that one of two things happened, and one is infinitely more likely than the other.  Either a) Marvel legit killed off 15 of its characters in one scene or b) they wanted the audience to think they did so they could have a cheap cliffhanger. The problem is that if option A is correct, everyone is going to be thinking they actually went for option B! The way the scene is played is very straight, very emotional, loud music + slow motion etc so they are very clearly trying to make you care. But the problem is, regardless of whether these characters are going to remain dead, I spent the whole scene thinking that they would almost certainly all come back via Time Stone magic in the next film.  Had they killed off maybe two or three primary characters then it would have been believable but you can't kill off half your franchise in a universe where the Time Stone exists and expect me to care. So overall, a mixed bag but generally positive. 6/10.", "I hated it because they all die and it was too sad", "Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie. As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted. First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame. The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the clich\u00e9 fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ). There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film. Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'", "Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me.  Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever.  More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen. Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it. However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view. Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character.  Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion.  'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart.  Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored.  Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox", "You can't just change the characters to suit the plot for one movie. Really bad move! I believe Mr. Ebert called it an idiot plot. They made Vision into a whimpering weakling, Thor into a useless (but lovely) bundle of muscles, and Star Lord into a stupid jerk. Some others were off too. This movie was visually stunning, absolutely breathtaking CGI. Too bad the plot was made to suffer. Too bad :(. Glad I took advice and did not see it at the movies.", "Wow just wow!!! I left that cinema shocked and my mind reeling. Absolutely amazing From start to finish action packed, never a dull moment, truly amazing achievement from everyone who worked on this.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film. What a villain! Thanos is the most terrifying villain I had seen in comic books movie -Russo's made a masterpiece scenes didn't go away from my head after the movie ended -The scenes where \"Doctor Strange\" , \"Iron Man\" and \"Spider-Man\" were together were so F Awesome! -\"Thor\" was Great! Yes I want to see \"Thor\" like that all time! -All of characters made an awesome performance \n.", "Quite possibly the worst film I've seen. And I like these sort of movies. It's a visual triumph saddled with a narrative so weak and actually uninteresting that i only watched it to the end to see how bad it got. And it didn't disappoint. Superheroes come, go, drift in and out of the movie practically at random. What a mess.", "I like most of the Marvel-movies although the last ones like f.i. Black Panther are not very good. But a 8.6 on imdb: Infinity war must be a great movie!\nWell, it was NOT and unbelievable that it has a 8.6 on imdb!\nThrow in all the characters you have from the Hulk to Spiderman and mix it with Black Panther, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy and than you have a mix which is not taste or good at all. Add a dumb story about a villain, who needs an iron fist to become powerful and if he succeeds in collecting six stones than he will be able to minimize the population in the universe, throw in all the special effects you can imagine and volia: Avengers-Infinity War is there.\nWhat a waste of time and what a waste of potential.\nHopefully the next Marvel-movie will be a stand-alone again with only one or two Marvel-heroes in it because they now go the wrong way.", "I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess. Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show. The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.", "Greetings from Lithuania. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" (2018) was a pretty fun and good movie overall. The ending kinda saved it for me to be a 7/10, ending was good and that is why i'm giving this movie 8/10. But i do not believe that it will end eventually the way it ended in this movie, common - there a more bucks needs to made from this universe. That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then \"Terminator 2\" or \"Apocalypse Now\" - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself. Overall, \"Infinity War\" was a good 2 h 20 min escapism, but it suffers pacing issues here and there. At the end i liked this picture and will check the 2nd part as well.", "Well, this movie is certainly entertaining and packed with action and expensive visual effects. It also gathers superheroes from several comics in one place. This feels both fresh and random. It also feels like each character is less interesting, because the writers had to write for so many characters, and they had to spread their effort instead of focusing it. The only actually funny characters here are the guardians of the galaxy, and they are still pretty shallow. The villain team looks like some orcish/undead characters straight from some fantasy video game. The ending might seem like a fresh move for some people, but to me it was just very underwhelming. Not unexpected, no twist, just \"to be continued\", and also on the verge of justifying genocide. This already makes the movie not really worth watching. You get entertained, but it's shallow and empty. And besides that, there are lots of logical inconsistencies. And the biggest one is why would they even fight throughout the whole film? The outcome of their fight is completely inconsistent with their effort. Then, why does the main villain use his powers in some cases and instantly undoes everything that the good guys try to do upon him, but in other cases he just wrestles with them as if he has no superpower at all? And gets no damage most of the time, except one moment where he gets a tiny scar. This really lowers the stakes. All in all, there's no need to watch this movie.", "Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine). As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it. Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements:\n1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines?\n2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least.\n3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot.\n4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? \n5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise?? Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.", "Jokes are not very great, too many jokes in the middle of fight ruins the seriousness of the situation. The only things thats good in the movie is Thanos. Not heroes, death of Black Order looks so cheap. Just a another movies for target on general audience and millennials. Plus with a lot of plot holes", "The hype for Avengers Infinity War was truly real. The expectations were to the roof with this one, but I'm afraid we all did a huge mistake on what to expect. Can a 150 minute movie deliver on the level of these expectations and hype? Well it can't, but this movie does it's best.This film is completely different than any other MCU film, and any other film in general, and you will find that out when you see it for yourself. You must be happy to see your favourite character even for 5 minutes in this movie, that's one of the necessary cons of the mix, and we shouldn't expected more in the first place.The movie lacks basic plot development. That'sFORTUNATELY not a very bad thing in the end of the day. \nIn general, the movie delivers what a 150 minute movie with 20+ main cast can deliver. The consequences were unexpected, and shocking, and the Russo brother did their best. I'm sure if you go to see he movie with low expectations you will enjoy it a hell more. \n9.5/10 After rewatching this movie I will change my vote from 8 to 9.5. *It's impossible for this title to remain at 9.5/10, and do not trust this number. Batman v Superman started at 9.8 as well, and we know where it ended up. Really, I think most of the fans will like it A LOT, but the score will drop A LOT once the movie opens in the US and China. Most of the votes now, come from people who have not even seen the movie yet.", "Abysmal and embarrassing cinema. The outcome of dumbing down and treating the audience as morons.", "Where has her accent gone? She was European in the last movie. Now she's American?", "Best movie Avengers infinity war 2018 I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.", "I have always felt Marvel VILLAINS that hit the big screen were laughable. And then came Thanos - finally a formidable opponent that was to be taken seriously. Enjoyed this one from start to finish. Only giving it a 9 because its sequel is better and perfect and thus deserves a perfect score of 10. 9/10", "Now this was epic... surprising plot twists.... so much build up - epic fight scenes, good humour and great banter. The ultimate penultimate and better the 2nd time around", "Infinity war had the best cgi in a movie ever,it felt so much like a thanos movie and will forever be a classic it was the biggest crossover in history to date, its deserving of its 8.5 score but should be higher the endgame thanos was such a well developed villain that felt more like the hero his CGI was unbelievable everything from the veins to the hairs thanos is the best CGI character I've seen", "Too many characters, weak plot with little or no direction, then token kill em all at end was just plain stupid. Hated it, and that's hard for me because I've been loyal to all these Super Heroes for years. Glad I waited for Netflix. If I'd paid $20 to see IMAX, would have been like Thanos getting my money back at box ffice. What a waste of time.", "303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.", "While this movie was terrific with tons of special effects and battle scenes, the jumping from planet to planet to magic places to past and present was very confusing... The cgi and battles were awesome, but the acting was so so and cliche. The worst was the horrible confusing ending which made absolutely no sense.. My wife and I both yelled WTF when the credits started, because the movie was surely NOT over... So lame of an ending.. I still do not know what happened... Very disappointed in this one compared to the other ones.", "Felt like it had the same problems as Captain America: Civil War. Just too much crammed together under an overly complicated plot. No one character or event was able to get enough screen time to make much of a lasting impression, there never felt any sense of urgency to the fact that Thanos was gonna kill half the universe off, it the sequence of the scenes was disorganized. Thanos was a very interesting character and the movie should have been told more from his perspective so we could learn more about him and give the movie more organization.", "Firstly, let me just admit that I haven't been devotedly watching every film in this series with a tie-in to this latest Avengers' outing. Looking at my reviews at this site, the last one directly related to this one that I saw was this film's immediate predecessor, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\". From the moment this latest film begins, with superheroes dead or dying on what looks like the aftermath of some epic battle, it gives the impression of having immediately followed on from some previous Marvel film...which I haven't seen...which may or may not be the case. I.e. perhaps there was a film which showed the epic battle of which the opening scene is the aftermath? If so, then, obviously, it might pay to watch every single tie-in film to this one to be in the loop*, so to speak.   Secondly, apart from possibly not being a true stand-alone film, the ending also makes clear that there will have to be another Marvel film which will directly follow-on from the ending of this one. There are some obvious story elements in this latest Marvel film which makes clear that I have missed certain developments from previous Marvel films that I have missed (i.e. chosen to ignore...it looks like the only other Marvel film that I saw before Infnitity War was \"Deadpool\" and I do plan on watching the sequel to that sometime soon). Characters from other franchises also appear...e.g. the Guardians of the galaxy...another Marvel franchise that I have not seen (and the level of comedy that those characters reveal in this film doesn't make me feel like I've missed out on anything by not seeing that other franchise). Other characters, well...I have no idea who these people are...  All that being said, I have to say that none of this is an excuse as to how low the bar has been set for this film, as far as the writing, characterisation and entertainment factor goes. This tends to be a problem with most films in this universe...eventually I just get bored of seeing the sequels...which happened after the first Thor film for me and maybe the third Iron Man film, if I made it that far...or the Spider-Man reboots...perhaps even the latter film(s) of the Tobey Maguire incarnation of the character.  Anyway, the plot of Infinity War concerns a supervillain called \"Thanos\", who seeks to gain great power by collecting \"Infinity Stones\" (most of the names of these stones sound pretty unimpressive...I feel that marketing could have really put more work into coming up with cool sounding stones), which give him various mystical abilities which he uses for warlike purposes. He's already made a start on the collection of Infinity Stones (gotta catch 'em all!). Seeing Thanos in action against superheroes, he really does make them seem like boys fighting against men...who are warriors. An interesting aspect to Thanos' character is his psychology...he wants to collect all the Infinity Stones so that he can bring about much faster his plan to randomly kill fifty per cent of all life in the universe. He espouses reasons such as societies eventually collapsing and dying because there are too many people and not enough resources to sustain them. On that level, he does come across as rational...but is he? In other words, is he just so crazy he has to be stopped? Why fight it? Of course, such plans are anathema to superheroes and they try their best to stop Thanos.  So, the reason that I score this film poorly...it just doesn't try very hard to be entertaining, apart from in the action department. It relies on fans being so obsessed with the characters in this universe that they will lap up every attempted joke the writers have to offer. And the writers lack the wit of a Joss Whedon. For instance, one scene has Thor made to look an idiot (the bit where he tries to harness the power of a star) and another character (Hagrid?) labouring that obvious point as a result. Generally, most of the jokes fail. The odd joke works, but they aren't particularly high calibre. If you absolutely LOVE this universe, the writers are relying on you to be so invested and so well predisposed to these characters that they will have to do very little quality work for you to lap it up. In my review here of \"Age of Ultron\", I think I pondered whether I would continue seeing more films in this series. Based on this film, I think that it might be unlikely.  Contrast that criticism with films that are based on stories unknown to the public and/or with a cast of unknown leads...they can sometimes create a great emotional investment in the characters and story or amuse you with their wit and comedy. With Infinity War, it's all shorthand...the invested viewer has to fill in the gaps which the scriptwriters don't provide themselves, as far as characterisation and humour goes.  Some reviews that I've come across mention that favourite superheroes die in this film. Seeing what Thanos does immediately preceding such events makes me wonder how permanent such an outcome is.  * Having to watch EVERY film with a tie-in to Avengers' films just seems like too high a price to pay. It's not worth it, just for the latest Avengers film to make sense. Being entertained is more important to me, and eventually the sequels bore or the spin-offs underwhelm. Random observations: * I saw this film in 2D. It's my strong suspicion that forking out more to watch it in 3D would be a waste of money...nothing really struck me as being particularly geared towards a 3D experience and often Hollywood makes rather pointless 3D movies anyway...just a vacuous way to extract more money from the cinemagoer. * The closing credits mentions \"Arrested Development character\"...I wonder what that refers to. * Near the start of the closing credits the name \"Okabayashi\" appears...not sure if I noted that accurately...but I did wonder if it was related to a a word I came across which related to the Star Trek universe: \"Kobayashi\" (I had to search a list of Star Trek video games to remind myself of that name!). * Like a James Bond film, the closing credits have the phrase \"Thanos will return\"! * What's that black thing in Captain America's ear? Which film did I miss to see the explanation of that?", "The movie is full of very well developed action scenes. It catches the viewer's attention from the very first moment and makes good use of the Avengers skills. However, it's full of gore and extreme violence. In many times I found my daughter looking behind or elsewhere from the violence scenes. What was totally affecting her overall satisfaction was also the ending of the movie and the message it might holds. I wish I was warned before entering the movie about the number of extreme killings in the movie. I would have sure picked another one to watch with my child. One last aspect, the movie seems incomplete to me and I am not in favor of such type of stories.", "*** SPOILERS *** I just don't get the rave reviews for Infinity War.\nYes, the action is great. Yes, the special effects are great.\nYes, there's a pretty good balance between most of the different characters; and seeing some of our favourite characters meet up with some of our other favourites was also great.\nI just can't understand people raving about the ending... *** SPOILER REMINDER *** Given that we know there are a few more films in the pipeline- Spidey and Guardians to name just two, to have those main characters killed off was pointless because we know that they are going to have to be resurrected in Infinity War 2 (before the new stand alone character films are released).\nHowever they do this, (time reversal or diving into the soul stone or whatever), it simply means that characters are going to be resurrected. For all we know they all will be, and Thanos will seem like an insignificant blip on the radar because everything he did possibly gets undone. It was so jarring because I didn't believe it for a second that the 'deaths' were real (ie. Black Panther, Spidey and the Guardians). I knew they had to be resurrected.\nIt just killed the tension, it killed the atmosphere- I mean why should I cry for Parker when I KNOW he's coming back? By the time the end credits stinger rolled around and more deaths occurred, I was snarling contemptuously at the screen. I was so bitterly disappointed. It honestly (and I mean this wholeheartedly) feels like the last Twilight film- there's a super cool battle that essentially is just a dream- it never really happened. It's the same plot device and I am stunned to hear people saying that the end of A:IW was heart wrenching. How gullible do people have to be?\nJust so you know, I'm the kind of film viewer who doesn't critique everything while I'm watching a film. I like to just enjoy the experience, absorbed in the events unfolding before me. A:IW just didn't work at all, the writers bit off way more than we could chew!\nI really want to rate it 2 stars because I'm so disappointed by the ending, but as I mentioned, there were a lot of really good things about the film.", "This was by far the worst Marvel movie ever. All the main people end up dying... the CGI and plot twists needed more work. So many \"done before\" concepts. I really expected a better movie from them. Instead of saving the world or even failing to save the world... let's just float away in pieces like ashes in the wind dying... how original.", "Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that \"I don't understand\" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!", "There are movies that have a lot of car chases and explosions and stunts and special effects, but the story is weak and contrived. This movie is kind of like that. It's crap with star power. I will say that it was cool to see so many heroes in a single movie, and there were good special effects and lots of explosions. But, geez, the plot was so weak and contrived! This is what I call \"dumbed down\" writing as found in Maverick, a 1994 western about a gambler in a poker tournament. The buy in per player was $25k! In today's money, that's about half a million dollars, for the buy in, not the prize!\nDUMB! The writers knew this, why not fix it? Because they think people are too dumb to understand that $1k was a huge amount in the Old West, so they dumb down the writing for them. I hated this, and it ruined that movie. A:IW commits the same sin, more than once. First, consider the Infinity Stones -- 6 stones created at the Big Bang of the Universe with unmatched power, supposedly. Yet 2 of them belong to Earth heroes? (Vision and Dr. Strange). And the rest all seem to be in our corner of this one relatively small galaxy. With more than a billion trillion stars in the Universe, this is STUPID. Next, let's consider Thanos' motivation. He grew up on a planet where overpopulation led to collapse of civilization, so now he is on a crusade to ride the Universe of overpopulation by killing exactly 50% of the people Universe. Does anyone else think this is too idiotic? I mean, sure, people on a planet with no space travel and limited technology might overpopulate that planet to the point of self-destruction, but, like, the Universe is full of empty space and empty planets. Like, billions, maybe trillions, of empty planets. And under-population can cause societal collapse, too, right? Insufficient genetic variation and such. Oh, and overpopulation is often a self-correcting problem because as resources get more scarce, people fight more over them and kill each other off.\nNot pretty, but effective and largely unavoidable. Thanos' motivation is so stupid that, in fact, one would expect the other characters who discussed the motive to note the stupidity, BUT THEY DON'T! Everyone acts like it is reasonable if cold and heartless. NO IT'S NOT REASONABLE!!! If you really want to know how dumb this is, consider that the human population doubles about every 60 years. Assuming our growth is average for other intelligent species in the Universe, that means Thanos literally just set back the \"problem\" of Universal overpopulation by 60 years. And I think he spent hundreds or thousands of years on this master plan? Anyone see the problem? Bueller? Next, the plot is based on the fact of how infinitely powerful these six stones are, so any hero with just one of them is thereby one of the most powerful superheroes of all. With only 2 stones, Thanos lays out the Hulk with one punch -- the Hulk who held his own against Thor (and then some) in Ragnarok. Then with 3 stones, Thanos defeats the GOTG the blink of an eye. Then with 4 stones... he suddenly has trouble against Iron Man and Starlord? with three stonesBut later, when Thanos has 4 stones, he has trouble knocking out Iron Man, Spiderman and Dr. Strange? And after getting all 6 stones, we learn Thor could have defeated him if he went for a head-blow with his new axe? (The axe trumps 6 stones? Why was Thanos not collecting these axes instead?!) Next, everyone hero Thanos fought, it was like he had a man-crush on him, gushing how much he respected him. Over & over & over. A transparent attempt to explain away Thanos -- the most ruthless and villainous person in the Universe -- sparing hero after hero (until the very end when he wipes out half the universe, thereby setting back overpopulation by 60 years).It makes no sense for Thanos to spare these heroes he could easily kill in fight after fight after fight. He spares Thor (twice), spares Iron Man, spares the Guardians of the Galaxy at least once, spares almost every hero he encounters in Wakanda. Dumb/fake. Next, it is a common flaw in most of these \"multiple superhero\" movies for the authors to complete punt on any logic to the relative strength and power of the respective heroes. I mean, Captain America is basically just a human juiced up to be, maybe, 10 times stronger than a normal person? That leaves him about a thousand (or maybe a million?) times weaker than Thor or the Hulk or Iron Man. And don't get me started on Hawkeye and Black Widow -- totally normal humans who happen to have some martial art skills. Yet in Age of Ultron with a horde of metal robots patterned off Iron Man's technology, somehow every single one of them is pretty much equally kicking ass. In reality, Hawkeye and Black Widow should have been killed by the first robot they encountered, and Captain America would have been killed shortly thereafter. To see a variety of comic book heroes fighting side by side despite their different power levels, we have to accept this kind of inconsistency. Fine, to a point. IMO, the Avengers movies up to this point did an okay job not going too far ignoring the reality of the power differentials of their heroes. But this movie chucked any realism out the window, then ran outside and pissed on it. We are to believe one of Thanos' top aides -- the woman with the horns -- has trouble defeating a human with no powers just some martial arts skills (Black Widow)? And sure, maybe Captain America is 10 times stronger than a regular human, but Thanos' four-armed, fang-toothed soldiers looked at least 10 times stronger than a regular human, too, so Captain America should not have been decimating them like he was Superman. Oh, yeah, in a big budget Hollywood movie, the \"hero\" can always effortless defeat an infinite horde of faceless creatures, without any explanation needed. With all the repetition of how infinitely powerful the six stones are together -- so strong Thanos can kill half the universe instantaneously with just a thought! -- how is it that some space dwarf can forge an axe that can take him down? By the same token, if the six stones are each infinitely powerful, how can one human O.D. on gamma rays or build a metal suit of armor & suddenly be a power match for some one with an infinity stone? (recall he Hulk having his way with Loki when Loki had an infinity stone in his staff) In fact, Iron Man's power is just plain stupid because from GOTG we know humans are, like, thousands of years behind in their technology. So even if Stark was a visionary building Iron Man's suit well ahead of Earth technology, that might mean it is 50 years ahead, still thousands of years behind those space-traveling alien races. I mean, to Thanos, Stark's technology must be like the steam engine is to us... Yet Stark can go toe-to-toe with Thanos? Makes no sense. Next, a common stupidity in superhero fighting in general: If a hero has near invulnerability, like Hulk, Thor, (or villains like Thanos), so that they might fall thousands of feet, crash into the ground, and then just get up and brush themselves off, then it necessarily follows that pickup on a giant piece of the ground and smashing it into that person will not hurt him either. Writers often act as if an object ,that would not hurt a superhero who flew into it, WILL hurt the hero if thrown at that hero by an enemy. No, no, no! If Superman can fly into the a train at 500 mph and not get hurt, then a villain picking up said train and throwing it at Superman at 500 mph cannot hurt him either. In effect, this fact would make fights between these near invulnerable heroes pointless and boring, so writers ignore this, but it still is dumbed down writing. Getting away from general superhero movie criticisms, and back to this movie, a lot of the scenes were just not that fulfilling. When some of the heroes managed to put Thanos to sleep and were about to remove his infinity gauntlet, Starlord suddenly starts hitting Thanos and demanding he tell him what happened to Gematria, so he wakes up before the gauntlet is removed.\nDude, with half the population of the Universe at risk, you can't hold yourself back from interrogating him just 60 seconds till the gauntlet is off??? Then you can waterboard Thanos all you want for information!!! Seriously? The writers want me, as an audience member, to feel satisfied with that story line? STUPID WRITING!!! Almost as bad was the defeat of Thanos crony who controlled metal like Magneto. They blow a hole in the ship wall and he's sucked into space. Seriously? Can't he just use his power to float some metal to him, grab it, and then float it back into the ship like a buoy? Or maybe float the whole metal ship to himself? Or just seal up the metal hull of the ship before he gets to it? It seemed like the most lazy way to resolve that fight, not even trying to be clever or believable. Why not have the bad guy slip on a banana peel and hit his head, just as original and plausible. Should we ponder again how Thanos with 2 stones easily beats Hulk, Hulk beats Thor (in Ragnarok), and Thor at the end is just about a match for Thanos with 6 stones? This will never make sense, and it is lazy and poorly thought out writing.", "OH GOD! This movie is unbelievable everything is AMAZING, Acting, Directing, Soundtracks!!!\nThank you marvel we are so glad \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "I understand why Marvel fans like this movie, but I wasn't impressed. From first scene to last it is just bang, bang, crash, smash, bang! The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here. I'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience. I still gave it 7/10 for its appeal to the fans, but possibly 5 or 6/10 for myself. Recommended for the fans, not anyone else", "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.", "From the story to trying to incorporate The Black Panther into the story just hurts the franchise all together.\nThe story starts off good, gets better then goes to the dogs with a ending that just does not make sense.", "There are obviously good things about this movie - a lot of talented people worked on it and especially in the scene design there is a lot to like. But there are a lot of problems too.\nFor one it feels disjointed, as if there are scenes that have been uncomfortably cut out. Only a few characters get introduced, and just a few more get what feels like a decent amount of screentime and dialogue. With Cap for example, his role feels extremely insignificant - as if he as a character could have been replaced with any other Avenger performing the same actions and nothing would change.\nI thought Vision's and the Witch's romance was pretty inoffensive and sweet. I was surprised at how much of a role they had, but the actors did very well at making me see them as real characters, which was at times difficult with some of the more main-cast characters.\nOn the other hand Tony gets an uninteresting and cheesy as hell intro that easily could have been pared down, he and Strange have a stupidly prolonged dickwagging segment and Banner's way to frequent attempts at humor made me wish somebody would shoot him in the face already. The main I have is probably Thanos though.\nThanos' plan is quite obviously deranged and stupid as hell, but he's never portrayed as deranged. We're supposed to see him as a smart, sympathetic villain - which, quite honestly, is a joke. He's just a big, sadistic dummy with a god complex.\nIf they wanted me to see him as anything more they'd do more to set him up as traumatized and disturbed by the events at his home planet so we could see why he would ever be so dumb as to cling to his silly \"just kill half of everybody - that'll solve inequality\" plan.\nAlso, at a point at about the middle of the movie we realise Thanos can change reality around him, and from then on whenever he's in a physical fight with anybody I couldn't feel any stakes at all. He should be able to stop them with a thought or handmove or whatever - so is he fighting them with his fat fists? Does he just think it's fine excercise? It also doesn't help my view of the movie that I'm a Guardians (and Spiderman) fan over a fan of MCEU in general. If you've watched the movie already you'll probably know why that kind of sours one's view of this movie. I would much rather have more Guardians content in some other form than have this movie. It feels like it sacrifices Guardians - the characters, style and feel of it, on the alter of the crossover cash cow.\nSimilarly for Thor this movie kind of fucks up the story Taika Waititi built up in Ragnarok.", "I thought it would be great but sadly it was too boring", "Went down the 'event cinema' route. Lots of flying about. Lots of confused fighting. Too many characters. Ludicrous, unjustifiable character actions used to move the film along. They opted against using too much humour this time around too. It felt like a film made by committee of management consultants.", "As a huge fan of the Marvel universe i really looked forward to seeing this movie.\nI was very dissapointed in the story line.\nThere is a lot of action but it doesn't lead us anywhere. \nThen there is this feeling you are watching the same scene over and over again which makes the \"emotional\" scenes feel corny. In the anticlimactic end only the face 1 characters survive but I couldn't care less if they were gone too.\nNot looking forward to the next avenger movie with that whinging Titan.", "Bruce Banner cannot be the the Hulk during the whole movie. Vision is pretty much useless and just a liability through out the whole movie.  Doctor Strange could have amputated the gauntlet off of Thanos' hand like he did one of his goons earlier in the film. Doctor Strange could have briefed the Avengers on what they needed to do in order to beat Thanos that one time. The biggest and most annoying plot hole in infinity war is that Dr Strange, who can open dimensional portals to any location, didn't just open some portals and bring every hero all together on Titan to fight Thanos.", "I've grown up in the Marvel (and DC) universes, since a kid, I've read everything in comic book form, having my favourites of course. Thor: Ragnarok began a new trend in tongue-in-cheek Marvelism, submitting to humour while ignoring the basic qualities of the characters. Infinity War was a disappointment because it paid no heed to the capabilities of the characters. Going back to Thor as an example, we have the God of Thunder enduring the blast of a neutron star while in Ragnarok, he couldn't even extract himself from a magnetic chair. Back to Infinity, we find Dr Strange almost without a single trick up his sleeve and my all-time favourite, Vision, who couldn't hold his end up against any of Thanos' minions. The Scarlet Witch is supposed to distort the fabric of reality yet she choose only to move herself and objects around, giving very little evidence of the great power she had that suddenly allowed her to destroy an infinity stone with one hand while holding Thanos back with the other. Having achieved his goal of collecting all of the infinity stones, he then blows a fuse, where did that come from and where was he sent? Was it back in time to his home to retire in splendid comfort or was he stuck in a fantasy realm created by the fusing stones? And then, the final disintegration of many of the heroes, apparently at random, why Spiderman and Dr Strange and not Ironman? Why the Black Panther and not Captain America? Why Bucky and so on.... Did I enjoy the film? Yes, of course I did - it's part of the universe I know and is pure unadulterated fantasy, as it should be. I'm just sad that the makers didn't see fit to honour the legacy of Stan Lee and the Marvel artists of by-gone years.", "I will begin this review by stating that I am highly biased against all Superhero films. As in (almost) all the others that have ever been produced, Avengers: Infinity War falls in with the vast majority as a collection of over-worked cliches that are the backbone of this \"genre\".  I will admit that the banter of Tony Stark is clever. It always has been. I love Mr. Downey's ability to talk that talk. He is master of the fast, catch you on your heels style of verbal attack. For Tony Stark, it's a mixture of self defense and bringing you to the realization that you are actually dealing with a world class genius. A fun character. (Mr. Downey even sang on stage with Sting. Do a youtube search. You'll probably like it. I know I did). They toned the Stark character down simply because every one and their Superhero brother, aunt and sister made an appearence in this cliche.\nOn to my other gripe. We have the trope of the Superhero landing. You know, one foot, one knee and a hand on the ground with the other hand and the head in some stylized pose. I permanently turned off the Wonder Woman movie, featuring eye candy Gal Godot, the minute I saw it.  I puke each time I see this trope and thankfully, I didn't see it in Infinity War so my thanks goes out to the cast and director but my trusty barf bag was at the ready.\nMark Twain is reported to have said, \"History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes.\" Right once again, Mr. Clemens! I won't talk about the specifics of the film since truly, if you've seen one, you really have seen them all. I will confess and say that Deadpool 1 and 2 are the only two movies of this type that I actually enjoyed. We have actual human motivation and genuine, character driven drama and not just bombastic CG driven tripe. Plus the 4th wall is broken from time to time with irreverence. In other words, the DeadPool movies don't take themselves too seriously. That appeals to me.  As for the social aspect of why hungry audiences gobble up this tripe as quickly as Hollywood can churn it out is anybody's guess and here's mine. You live vicariously for the escape for 2 plus hours as you long to forget yourself and your society of hollow, mindless consumerism and its vapid celebrity worship. \nBut I'll go no further with that since ameteur anthropology is best administered in very small doses.", "Just like any Marvel movie but this Time people die. And they definitley will be brought back because of the money", "Mashing all superheroes and hoping that it will work?", "You know you can wrap a a pile of poo in pretty paper and bow but still a pile of poo and thats what this movie is sooooo disapointed", "I love Marvel movies but this one was just trash 50% of all the superheroes die and they lost what the hell i was so happy that a new avengers movie was coming out and now i seen it i want my money back and this movie can go in HELL", "The main reason i'm giving this movie 1/10 is because this one doesn't deserve the current rating that it has(at the moment of writing this is 8.6, I would refer to other current movie ratings at the moment of writing this review). A rating of 8.6 means that this movie is as good as The matrix(8.7), Saving private Ryan(8.6), Memento(8.5), Interstellar(8.6) and also that it is better than Mr. Nobody(7.9) and Synecdoche, New York(7.5), etc.  This is the result of a movie with lots of fans who don't have any idea how to rate a movie and usually haven't seen much. at the most I would give this movie a 5.3, it is not so bad and it's enjoyable not memorable. Too many jokes and this is not a comedy, it doesn't seem to have a script not giving a chance for the actors to actually act. In the movie they combine cinematography of some of the other movies related to this franchise, so in some instances the quality drops really low to the point you feel as if you're watching a really bad TV series, most CG effects are on point and sometimes not(the hulk buster). I personally don't understand who would give a score of 10/10 or 9/10 so easily to a movie no one will remember next year.", "First off the movie was great from begining to the end . A roller coaster ride of adventure I enjoyed it every minute and went out the theaters wanting to see more. So expect me to go see it again before it end its run.! No super hero movie has ever come close to what people at Marvel are doing at the moment. And Avengers Infinity War said that furthermore this movie soared through my expectations. The visual was spectacular the action was explosive and satisfying. The Russo's have crafted Something truly remarkable and freshness that you'd never expect. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing narrative possibilities that strech in any direction. On the strength of this outing, that's Something to be anticipated, rather than feared. I highly recomend everyone to go see it", "Best marvel movie yet, so much action and sadness at the same time. Can't wait for the 4th avengers", "What a terrible film. Theme was incomprehensible. Acting though was quit good even if the acting was all CGI. And, the ending???? WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Why did the producers have to keep the plot quiet till the end? Because it sucked! My kids love the Avengers, but I have since deleted all DVR recordings of them after watching this! Who in the world gave these jokes for producers money to destroy a franchise? Idiots!", "Story is scandalous. Too much heroes... you know what I mean. It really hurts during watching.", "What kind of a superhero movie is a superhero movie if they loose? The directors just clearly wanted people to waste money in watching this piece awful movie so that they can again waste money in the next awful movie to get more money with Captain Marvel and Ant-Man. Why? They could have just introduced them earlier and could have made a could superhero movie. This is no way similar to the comics. For a big comic book like me who wanted to see the infinity gauntlet storyline being adapted in live-action ,this movie just ruined. And not just that why do these people show scenes in the trailer that are never in the movie.", "Mind-numbing, give me your money for nothing, story what story, guess the number of celeb in... In short - lazy and bad, so so bad...", "Everybody is important but nothing really matters? How many \"Gods\" can their be? We all can't be equally matched. Eureka... We'll all work together! (( what a clever and original script - Not! )) And don't get me started, lol. Who is The Vision and why do we care? Was his climax with his girlfriend supposed to be stirring? It was awful soap opera. At least The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor and Spidey have funny lines. Just turn your clocks back and try to forget.", "I have no idea how this movie managed to get an 8.6. The story writing is exceptionally bad, and cliches used are dimes a dozen. It seemed a very rushed story involving too many actors and super heros. I do like super hero movies and do enjoy a good fantasy, but this was not it.", "We been waiting 10 years for this? So predictable, looks more a comedian movie then a action movie,", "I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining. There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine. I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra. I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame. I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, \"Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise.\" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.", "There's something odd about Infinity War and a lot of other Marvel films and it's hard to put my finger on it. But after thinking about it, here's an analogy. It's like watching a sports game where the top seeded team plays the lowest seeded team. If you're a fan of the top seeded team, then it's an amazing game. It's a very safe experience. You get to watch your team decimate their opponent. Every play is fun to watch and you leave feeling superior and satisfied. As an example I'll point out the first action sequence in Winter Soldier. Captain America jumps out of an airplane without a parachute like he's headed out to pick up the morning paper. When he lands on the ship of bad guys it looks like he's just in a casual daily sparring exercise. I felt no tension at all that he was in danger or that he couldn't take the entire ship down by himself. But here's where Marvel has it figured out. It LOOKS cool and impressive. Each kick and punch is thrown highly stylized and well choreographed. That is the problem there in general with Infinity War and others. I'd say I like about half the Marvel movies just to put that out there. To put things in contrast I'll bring up the show Agents of Shield(which sadly has been more or less cast out by Marvel). The writing on the show can be somewhat repetitive but what they do get right is the tension(and the amazing characters). Every season they put them through absolute hell over and over and over to the point where I don't know who is going to survive and even if they do, how will they recover emotionally? I'll frantically binge watch a season in like 2 weeks, staying up till 3 AM each night and then get mad at myself that I'm too tired to continue watcing. I don't feel this with the Marvel movies. But like I said before, Marvel has discovered that they don't need to make a tense storyline or deep relate-able characters. Really it's all about showcasing everyone's favorite character be dominant and show off their powers. One of the problems with Infinity War is that it felt like a sports game where they were giving out participation awards. Back in the day I was an avid comic book reader. And I knew that there was a wide range of characters with varying levels of powers. Some stronger, some medium and some without powers at all. It brought tension and interesting dynamics to the stories because why in the heck would Captain America take on Thanos head-on seriously? Cap is a smart guy. He's not that stupid. As far as super abilities Cap is on the lesser end. Similar to Batman in many ways. He uses his intelligence, speed and fighting ability most of all. But he knew his limitations and his comic book had a raw relate-ability that other comics didn't. The fact that Cap actually beat the crap out of Iron Man in Civil War is absolutely preposterous. So there were many moments in Infinity War where super heroes were treated on equal levels when they shouldn't have been. I have some other criticisms of the movie like how all minor villains were completely forgettable. I don't know their names or really much anything about them. And Black Widow continues to annoy me with her invincibility and the fact that she is so American it's cringe worthy. And Thanos' supposed sacrifice of Gomorrah and his inner pain that was trying to pull on my heart strings? Yeah not very believable. The movie wasn't terrible... just to clarify. But the main thing I wanted to point out is that many people are saying this is a great movie and well that's your opinion but maybe it's just a great looking movie and you enjoy it because you get to see your favorite heroes kick butt. But does that make it a good movie though? You could argue that it did have tension because at the end half of the characters die. By the time all that started happening I already knew that Marvel doesn't have the guts to kill of anyone major. They'll all be back in the next movie :)", "#avengersinfinitywar watched it for the 2nd time and I've changed my mind I can't fault it 10/10 and my favourite #marvel film - I'm still shocked by it all #unbelievablejeff", "Ironman is still the best for me. But the interaction between all the characters is just fun. Just awesome. I love it. Mabye my favorite Marvel ever. Can't wait to see Part 2.", "Avengers Infinity war is finally here, this has been my most anticipated film for a long time now and even though it is hard to believe this film lives up to all the hype and delivers a truly amazing film. The premise of the film sees the Mad Titan Thanos on the hunt for the six Infinity stones, standing in his way are the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. This film has tons of characters but in my opinion the main and most important character in this film is Josh Brolin's Thanos. This character could have been a weakness to this film but it turns out he is the most interesting part of this film, his character is menacing and bought to life amazingly through great CGI. He also has so much depth to his character and a detailed motivation for his actions that made this overall story much more interesting. Robert Downey Jnr is back as Tony Stark/Iron Man and he is so natural in this role that he could probably play it in his sleep. He adds his usual fun to the film but also some really important character moments that helped this performance. Another important character in this film is Thor played by Chris Hemsworth, after the success of Thor Ragnarok, Hemsworth continues to excel in this role and I found his part in this film to be interesting and fun to watch. Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Holland recently had there solo movies as Dr Strange and Spider-man and they both did a great job in this film. They add depth to their roles in this film especially Cumberbatch that helps build interest in his character when interacting with Downey and Holland. The rest of the Avengers and Guardians cast all do great jobs in their roles even though due to the large amount of characters in this film certain individuals may not get the screen time that audience members would like. The story in this film was something I was worried about due to the huge cast, but this film delivered. All the different story arcs were worked really well and gave something different to the overall story, also as mentioned previously the villains story is treated really well and gives this villain more depth then expected. This film also promised to raise the stakes and they do this in an appropriate but natural way that will keep the audience interested. The script has the usual Marvel humour in it, but the most important part of the script was the added drama and depth added to the characters really raised the bar for this film that they delivered on. The style in this film is huge and epic, the balance of story arcs are treated well and allowed the majority of characters to feel relevant. The action scenes in this film felt huge in scale and unique depending on the characters involved with helped really make this film unique. Overall this is truly the epic Marvel blockbuster promised and needs to be seen at the cinema to be truly appreciated, just make sure you are caught up on these films and go see this film as soon as possible.", "Was this movie purposely stupid or what? Nobody wins in the end. The bad guy Thanos collects all the stones and goes to rest at a sunset and the movie ends. I mean WTF did I just watch!?", "Avengers: Infinity War getting anything above a 6 ratings destroys my faith in IMDB's rating system. Once I got past the first page of 10/10 ratings, the rest were 1, 2 and a few miscellaneous 5's. Four of us sat down to watch this movie last night and only two of us could finish it. I apologized for renting it and threw IMDB's ratings system under the bus. I kept waiting for something redeeming to happen, but it never did. The countless times I said, \"Well, that was stupid\" went on through the entire movie. Plot holes, lazy writing or whatever you want to call it were just constant. I will not wait through another 2+ hour movie in this series hoping for something redeeming to happen. Oh, and taking the red, white and blue away from Captain Am.., wait, what's his name again? Steve somebody. No, I'm done and whatever gaming of the IMDB ratings went on makes it of less use too.", "After 2 outstanding Avengers movies comes this one. It seems that their only goal was how to make this one so long and without victory for Avangers , so we have to \"wait\" Infinity war part Two.\nShame on you Marvel. You spoiled everything you did great with Tony Stark and Hulk.", "Pros: 1. It took 19 movies, but for the 1st time ever MCU finally has a villain who isn't awful or lame. A \"former\" MCU fan (who has been invited to never come back to this forum) used to say MCU is better than DC because MCU always makes the heroes the main character while DC makes the villain the main character. Well, Infinity War takes a page out of DC's playbook and makes the villain the main character and it's the 1st time in 19 movies that the villain of an MCU movie isn't awful or lame. 2. Loki repeating Tony Stark's line from the 1st Avengers movie (\"We have a Hulk\") and then Thanos proceeding to give Hulk such a severe beatdown that Hulk turned into a 1000-pound coward and was too scared to show up for the rest of the movie. 3. Loki finally getting killed. Loki (\"I'm evil because I was adopted and Daddy Odin loved Thor more than me\") has always been an awful, lame, and useless villain. \nCons: 1. This movie was a big mess, constantly jumping all over the place from 1 location to another. 2. Drax claiming to be \"invisible\". Stupid scene that added nothing to the movie. 3. MCU ripping off The Illiad with Thanos sacrificing his daughter to get the soul stone. 4. Too many MCU characters were ready and willing to put half the universe at risk for their own selfish needs: a. Starlord - threw a hissy fit and helped Thanos to break free b. Doctor Strange - gave Thanos the time stone (which Thanos used to reverse time and get the mind stone from Vision's forehead later) just to save Iron Man and sacrifice half the universe; also knew which of the 14 million possible paths was the only path to defeat Thanos but took that secret to the grave and let Thanos kill half the universe rather than tell anyone else the winning path (MCU fans made the dumb excuse that telling others the winning path would bias their decisions. Of course, it's supposed to bias their decisions - so they can make the right decisions to defeat Thanos! If you're given the correct answers to a test BEFORE the test, of course you're going to write down those correct answers when you take the test. Who would be so stupid to NOT write down the correct answers if they're given the correct answers BEFORE the test?) c. Scarlet Witch - made an entire country fight Thanos just so she can keep her robot sex toy 5. Spider-Sense not working properly again as Spider-Man gets ambished and taken hostage by a guy with no superpowers. 6. An ending that will probably be reversed in Avengers 4, resulting in this movie having no stakes and basically being a waste of 2 and 1/2 hours since 90% of what happened in this movie will have been reversed in Avengers 4. Also, why is there even a need for Avengers 4? If Strange can use the time stone to see how to defeat Thanos, then Thanos should be able to do the same thing and see which is the only possible way he could be defeated and prevent that from ever happening. So it should now be impossible to defeat Thanos and there's no need for an Avengers 4 since it's now impossible for the Avengers to win.", "Three hours of life I will never get back. Pure crap!!!!! Why do people like this garbage?", "Avengers: Infinity War is hands down the BEST ensemble superhero movie ever made. The story in it is great. The settings goes perfectly well with the plot, and the ensemble cast were all amazing. It was beyond my expectations! I don't know what to say next, but thank you to the cast and crew for putting your blood, sweat and tears into this amazing movie. I am shocked and amazed by the way it ended but I promise not to spoil it for you guys because this is a spoiler-free review. I cannot wait for the next Marvel movies (such as Ant Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel and the culminated Avengers 4).", "Firstly, you need to watch this film free from spoilers. From the opening scene, the antagonist is centre stage and carries the film throughout. Flawed in his character and convinced that he is forthright in his convictions and will let absolutely nothing stop him from achieving his goal. The action carries the film through perfectly, interrupted by the gentle phase between scenes and story arcs then ramps up the pace to breakneck speed throughout until the closing scene. Acting is fantastic, dialogue between the cast is executed to perfection and never gets crowded or shoehorned in for plot as has other recent super hero films. The rapport from the characters across different franchises caries them through the comedy moments, the desperation when they appear to hit rock bottom and the plight of each character delivers emotional sentiment as yet unseen in a Marvel movie. My criticism? Thanos' black order felt a little rushed and disproportionate to his screen time so you didn't get to know their characters as well as you should have. And yes, certain scenes feel disjointed but they are supposed to as they will be resolved in Avengers 4. My best Marvel film to date. Cannot recommend it enough.", "This review is no more spoilery than what's already been in the tv ads... There's a shot in one of the tv commercials for The Avengers set in a forest where we see for the first time together on screen, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America facing each other. The spine tingling electricity that engendered in me lives fresh in my memory: \"Look at them, all together at the same place! It's just like a scene from the comics!\" Avengers: Infinity War taps into that same power source, amplified by an order of magnitude or more. There are so many wonderful interactions between never-before-seen combinations of characters, watching it is regularly delightful. (Particularly entertaining is Thor amidst the Guardians of the Galaxy, but Stark, Strange and Spider-man have some great moments also.) The tv ads already give a hint of the scale and scope of the battle in Wakanda, but fortunately the actuality exceeds expectations. In fact so many moments from the film have appeared in the tv ads that one might be worried the whole story (or at least too much of it for its own good) has been laid out in advance. It's a real strength of this movie that it has avoided this risk. There are plenty of plot strands barely hinted at in the promotions, many hitherto-unseen (did I really just say that?) powerful moments that deliver hugely satisfying or heart-breaking emotion, and regular genuine surprises.  It's a busy movie but never confusing or flustered. There are references or call-backs to pretty much every single preceding MCU movie, which add to the enjoyable feeling of watching a shared universe develop. Being familiar enough with earlier movies to recognise these various elements adds to the pleasure of watching, but is not really required to follow and enjoy the story. With criss-crossing subsets of heroes grouping and regrouping across multiple locations on multiple missions, it really does capture the feeling of reading one of those massive company-wide summer crossovers so popular in mainstream comics these last few decades.  It's a great success. If you've seen and enjoyed any MCU film in the last decade, there's something here for you and you shouldn't miss it (and I hope and expect you won't)!", "Just saw Avengers: #InfinityWar!!!\nIt's EPIC!!! A Masterpiece!!!\nIt's so amazing, brilliant and emotional!!!\n10 years of hard work has paid off!!!\nThe unsolved problems left behind.\nCan't wait for the next one!!!\nThank you so much to everyone involved!!!", "Hollywood achieved a new high in quantity over quality: even more actors, even longer duration, even more special effects, even more chaos (incl. chaos on the script itself, in the sense of entropy vs order), and in the end it felt like a TV episode that suddenly ended just before you see what you were waiting for in the whole duration, to be continued next week, except that in this case it won't. \nLike 2.5 hours weren't enough to include an ending, so you have to wait for the movie industry's next release, obviously next year (as usual) to see what you were supposed to see on this movie. Watch the movie if you want to watch for 2.5 hours a completely uninspired, unintelligent and boring plot, been written by a group of writers who obviously were bored themselves in their personal lives, with all usual cliche and banal lines, a film that has nothing to say, and doesn't worth a dime either as fantasy, as science fiction as drama, or comedy. If you add them all, the sum is zero.  Of course, you get a parade of popular actors that participate and serve that worth-less movie, and a series of computer effects. But a film is much more than actors and effects, it is supposed to have essence, inspired messages and stories that worth the time you spend watching, otherwise it's just an effects demo. You can watch many special effects demos on YouTube, on the cinema you are supposed to see a movie, not a demo. So if you want to go to the cinema, or rent a movie, better look for a real movie, one that honors the art of cinematography and you'll come out smarter, not dumber.", "High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, \"Infinity War\" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color.  But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result.  If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly.  I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it. 6/10", "10 years and 19 movies led to this. A decade of classcis planting the seeds for this masterpiece.\nGreatest movie ever made. Period", "That was so painful and boring. We couldn't wait for it to end. Of course, once it ends, we still had to sit there for another 12 minutes for it to finally end.", "I really tried to like this movie. I smiled and expressed enthusiasm. I bounced and nodded. I boned up on the Marvel universe. Finally the day came and I watched the movie. For some reason I was completely bored. One fight after another. Lots of stuff blowing up. Lots of people running around. Characters blowing up and running around at the same time. Is it possible I have become overstimulated by this type of adolescent entertainment? Believe me, my girlfriend and I have a better relationship than some of the so-called romance subjects in this hyped up disaster movie. I think I have grown up and comic book characters are no longer my role models. Oh well.", "*Spoiler Alert* \n*Spoiler Alert* \n*Spoiler Alert* \n*Spoiler Alert*  IMO when most everyone fades to dust, the good guys lose and evil wins and the movie gets a good rating, there is something to be said about the level of humanity in our current world. How can it be a good movie when evil wins, most of the good are destroyed and everyone leaving the theater is in shock? When I left the movie, everyone was quite. It was like leaving a funeral and then people go online to give it a good rating? Uh?", "I guess I will be dissenting reviewer here among the many other apparent glowing reviews here. I have watched the various Marvel movies and in particular the Avengers series released over the last 5 years. This one has got Marvel heroes and villains raining in left right and centre from the start with limited background or story to set the scene. The comedy in the face of apparent disaster seemed misplaced. And I have to say it has probably got the most anticlimactic ending ever. I won't go into the details to avoid spoilers for those of you have not watched it yet. However i appreciate this was probably to get people to watch the next movie. But myself and the rest of the viewers in the theatre i was at today was shocked at this abrupt ending with little meaning or explanation. Was not impressed hence the 4 rating.", "It's been about an hour since I saw this movie and I'm still in shock. This movie was absolutely overwhelming from start to finish, and it really brings a strong emotional aspect that we have never seen from Marvel before. No doubt this is in my top 5 movies of all time, and there is no reason why you should not see this movie. But, before you see it, if you are not familliar with the marvel universe, I recommend doing a little bit of research before going.", "It honestly doesn't get bigger than this! We've been waiting 10 years to witness Thanos' wrath.... and it's here! In full blown force two and half hours of madness that even for how long it is , it will literally have you wanting more! A superhero masterpiece!", "It was ridiculous how many times the Avengers should've taken out Thanos. When Starkiller punches Thanos when they almost had the glove off, it ruined a lot of the movie for me. There were so many poor decisions the Avengers made that demote this movie. From not destroying the stones while they had them, to seeking out Thanos separately instead of all together, these dumb decisions made this movie unrealistic given the world. It's still one of the better Marvel movies, but it could've been better had the characters behaved more rationally.", "Grass grow in my back yard. Damn, what a long drawn out fight to nothing.", "No matter what people think about me or my opinions, I wanted to like this film more than anyone. I love superheroes, I love Marvel and as much as I criticize the MCU for being safe and formulaic, there are several Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've loved (The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the first 2 Captain America movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther to name the big ones). And I love that this movie enthralled and captivated many of my friends, a good number of them calling this one of their favorite movies of all time. However, the truth of the matter is that Avengers: Infinity War disappointed me. It deeply let me down. It's not an absolute failure and I certainly wouldn't call it irredeemable, but I can't say I find it to be a good film either. In terms of positives, the first one to come to mind would obviously be the jolly, purple giant himself, Thanos. He's undoubtedly one of the most interesting and developed villains in the MCU to date and he's acted phenomenally by Josh Brolin. I commend the creative team for keeping Thanos utterly despicable and villainous while still making him a compelling enough lead for us to be invested in his dark mirror of the Hero's Journey. It's fascinating to see an arc like this, full of sacrifice, struggle and personal loss concluding in an ultimate triumph, be translated to a villain without losing any of the qualities that keep him monstrous. He is a fully rounded, fully realized, human character; just not one who's a good person. As someone who hated Tom Holland's Spider-Man in both Civil War and Homecoming, I actually liked his performance and characterization here. The high stakes consequences of the story allow Holland to go to emotional places he simply wasn't allowed to before and his relationship with Tony Stark carries much more emotional weight, relatability and humanity to it than either of his previous two films. Maybe there's hope for this Spider-Man after all. Most (Keyword; most) of the content regarding the Guardians of the Galaxy is done wonderfully. Dave Bautista's Drax and Pom Klementieff's Mantis act wonderfully off of all the Avengers they get to interact with and it's nice to see that MCU teamup movies have moved and matured beyond thinking that every teamup movie needs all the team members to hate each other and fight over nonsense for 2 acts. Chris Pratt's performance as Starlord is truly heartbreaking and I commend the team behind Infinity War to have the guts to painfully strip away everything this character ever loved. For all my problems with the film, Starlord's emotional breakdown at Thanos after learning of Gamora's death is actually a major highlight of the movie for me. It's a deeply human and relatable moment that Pratt acts with such intensity and power. I also found myself really invested in the love story of Vision and Wanda. Elizabeth Olsen and Kevin Bettany have beautiful chemistry and their calm, soft moments before the storm bring a real gentleness and quiet beauty to the film. Scarlet Witch being forced to kill the only man she ever loved to save half the universe was by far the most emotionally powered moment of the movie and it's such a shame these two got so little screentime. That's the biggest problem of the film for me. Characters getting little screentime. Infinity War is deeply overstuffed, it has characters by the dozens and no idea what to do with a good half of them. Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, the Hulk; all of these characters (As well as the side characters they're associated with) could be completely removed from the film and nothing would change. And yet, I'm supposed to feel the epic weight of their massive battle with the army of Thanos despite their importance to the story being minimal at best and non-existent at worst? The ending felt cheap to me rather than dramatic and emotional. The only deaths to really affect me were Vision and Spider-Man. The rest (Minus Gamora, whose death is too awkwardly edited and weirdly toned down from a violence standpoint to affect me until Starlord's reaction, and Loki, who has been seemingly killed and brought back to life so many times that I hardly buy he's finally dead) die with little to no reaction from their friends and comrades when that's exactly what we needed. We don't get to see Rogers react to losing both of his closest friends or the rest of the Guardians all dying together. It's all such blatant sequel baiting, especially with many of the characters (Including Loki) already having future MCU films or TV shows announced. Gee, I guess they're all just going to center on piles of sand, huh? This kind of sequel baiting conclusion is hardly \"new\" or \"bold\" or \"inventive.\" In fact, it's pretty much what the MCU already did with Captain America: Civil War. Speaking of, as much as people want to give Guardians Vol. 2 crap for not balancing the comedy and drama well, where were your criticisms here? Towards a movie that starts making pop culture reference jokes almost immediately after Gamora's death, hardly even giving us a moment of mourning or reflection? A movie that hardly ever gives us a moment for pause for Thor to mourn Loki? I'm sure there was ambition in here somewhere, but in the end, everything got overpowered by the Marvel formula and tone for me. No, Infinity War isn't terrible, but I simply think it bit off more than it could chew. However, everything is set up for Part II to blow me away. I'm still holding out hope for this stage of the MCU to end in a high note for me.", "Gave it a 5 star rating but the meme has died so it's time for my true rating.\nPerfectly balanced. as all things should be.\nin all honesty its a great movie 9.5/10.", "Except for Thanos & maybe Strange, no one else in the whole movie acted like half of the population of the universe would be obliterated. Everyone kept repeating \"Thanos is very dangerous\" \"Thanos will destroy everything\" \"Thanos will kill everyone\" but 5 seconds later you will see them joking or fooling around. Most MCU movies are rubbish with same storyline, boring dialogues and pathetic acting by overpaid actors. This movie was headed the same way but the only saving grace was Thanos, during the movie I thought that if we have these MCU's clown superheros to save us then do we really need saving? Maybe if Thanos kills half of these 'superheros' then maybe Marvel will be forced to pay writers to write better scripts & hire better actors. There is something with Marvel movies that even some of the good actors after becoming part of MCU stop caring about acting. I guess given that our 'intelligent' population might not understand something sophisticated that is why studios are dumbing down. But what irks me is this 'highly intelligent' population of teenies starts rating movies on various platforms resulting in contamination of rankings/ratings. In conclusion, this movie is just average nothing more.", "Wow, Marvel knocked it out of the park with this one. \nThis is a totally different movie from anything Marvel has ever done before. First, I'll start out with the tone. This movie is dark. Marvel is sometimes criticized for being to light and happy, and I thought this was the opposite of that. Infinity War gives you a sense of hopelessness, sadness, and anger. It honestly felt like my soul was crushed, and everytime I think about the movie the feeling stays the same. Just because the movie made me feel these things, it was still great. I think that is one of the reasons you know a movie is good is that it gets you to feel these emotions about fictional characters. If you're scared about it being too dark, don't worry, there is some balanced humor throughout the movie, which for the most part I was fine with.  I thought everyone's screen time was balanced pretty well if they were a main character (Tony, Dr. Strange, Thor, etc), but if your favorite character is minor (Bucky, Okoye, Shuri, etc) don't be expecting a whole lot of screentime. However, I do wish Steve got more time. The Russo Brothers said Thanos and Thor would have a lot of screen time, and I agree with them on that. The movie shows Thanos in an interesting light which really makes you think about what he's doing. I loved Thanos as a villain. What he is doing is horrible, but the amount of emotion he shows really makes you feel for him.  Everyone's acting is incredible. A special shout out to Tom Holland and Elizabeth Olsen because they did an EXCELLENT job of portraying their characters feelings, which indeed made me cry. The cinematography is amazing as well. Later when I post a spoiler review I'll talk about some of my favorite shots, but for right now I'll just say when I saw one of the planets, the way it was portrayed was beautiful.  I love movie soundtracks. I listen to them sometimes on my free time, which makes me sound like a huge dork, which I am. My favorite soundtrack is Civil War, and Infinity War is up there too. The music is awesome when characters are introduced, and it also is downright depressing at times.  My favorite part right now is the ending. I am going to see the movie again to think about it more, but right now I do have one scene in my head that is my personal favorite. I'm sure if you've seen the movie you probably can guess it. The way the characters relationship was showed and how scared him/her was, it just broke my heart.  As if the movie couldn't get anymore depressing, the credits were dark and desolate. The music was solemn. But as always, STAY TO THE VERY END. Maybe that'll lift your spirits a little :)  Thank you to everyone at @MarvelStudious and @TheRussoBrothers . Why do you have to make me wait a year!!! I don't know how I'm going to make it. I'm going to try to see the movie again this weekend.", "Heros complexes x100... please change story. We have the same disk running for over a decade with hero movies please stop.", "Amazing movie, thanos and a great cliffhanger\nIt is the best movie ive ever seen", "What a movie! I walked out of the theatre shaking, wanting more, questions in my head, excitement for the fourth, mourning the deaths of many favourites! This was totally unexpected, just WOW! The moment the movie starts you know Thanos is serious business! First death occurs within the first 5 minutes and it leaves you in shock. From then on, I laughed, I cried, I was jumping out of my seat in awe of the sheer spectacle I witnessed on the screen. Every action sequence, character interaction, storyline, is just so perfectly woven in with each other. Do anything with your life but do not miss this movie!", "Complete downer movie. I can't believe I paid money and wasted hours of my life watching this trash. If I could go back in time and stop myself from seeing it, I would. I don't watch superhero movies to walk out of the movie MORE SAD than when I walked in!", "Marvel Studios ends their franchise with hopeless futility. Sad, very sad. The only honest thing in this horrible ending are the last two words of actor Sam L Jackson, words that cannot be repeated here, but are deeply felt and thrown right back at you Marvel. This film is a massive failure, and there was no good reason for it to be that way. Shame on you Marvel. Shame on you.", "What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing.  Positives. The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind \"Winter Soldier\" and \"Civil War\" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one. The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest.  Negatives This is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. \nThe humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other??\nThe third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to \"kill\" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong)\nThe final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts. Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.", "This is...I literally got no words after this movie. This is the most epic movie you'll ever seen. You will cry from pleasure, you will cry from epicness and you will definitely cry from heartbreaking scenes. Ten years of building, leading to this MASTERPIECE! I guess you want to know something about Thanos. Well, he is the ultimate villain, I mean he is menacing. Every speech that he got, gives you chills, his movements, his motivation, hands down the best villain! The interactions between the different fractions of heroes is magnificent. The first time you see Guardians and Thor, Iron Man and Guardians, Strange and Spidey it's just awesome! The chemistry between them is incredible. The story is told incredibly. The waiting for this movie, the hype, everything is worth it. Actions scenes especially some....are jaw dropping, you gonna shake your head and you will be not able to stay on your seat calm. The music combined with the scenes, like I said MASTERPIECE...this movie is out of this world. Russo Brothers just strike again! The visuals are so well done too. There is no way to catch every single detail on the first viewing, also the movie deserves multiple viewings again and again and again...and I'm not even joking.

I believe any real fan will be happy with the result of ten years gradation and like me, will got no words.", "I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too. I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to \nfocus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it.  The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations. 9.5/10", "In this movie, the emotion is close to nothingness.\nHowever, the potential was huge.", "Let me start off by saying I am a SciFi/Fantasy Fan, I love it.. it expands the mind and usually lifts the soul.

I understand this is part one of a multi part movie, but *explative* after a hard day I wanted to be 'entertained' not pulled into a depression.. negative from start to finish, nothing but bad feelings. Superhero's are supposed to give hope and you'll find NONE here. In this day and time we live in the entire point of watching a superhero movie to see what a super hero is supposed to do.

Perfect balance of drama, comedy and action. Congrats to all the cast and people who made this movie! You did us all proud!", "That's what you enter the theater with. Especially when you're going to see a Marvel movie. In this case not a single one was met. By the middle of the movie I found myself asking, where is it going and when is it going to get there. Three quarters in I found myself realizing it needed to be over. Every scene became a drag because that's what they did. On and on, one after another, with no endpoint. It was like the writer had a vision and then went blind. A simple plot that was easy to follow but it never seemed to develop. And you would think that in 2 1/2 hours you might get to know your characters a little. There was so much constant action and CGI, there was little or no time for that. If you enjoy being on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie will do it for you because the action is never ending. A shining example of overdone CGI, lots of violence, and not enough time to tell if anyone can actually act. All of this nonsense to be left in the end with an incredible sense of loss. When I go to a superhero movie I want the superhero to win. In this case, The Avengers are nothing but a bunch of losers.  And then there was the End Credits. They were giving credit to employees of the studios, like the CEO of Disney. WTF! This went on ad nauseum just like the movie itself.

Why care when you know it will work out in the end? Infinity war tropes that stereotype and gives the viewer new interest into the super hero world that may not always end with puppies and rainbows.  This is a great movie that tells an in-depth story line of interpersonal relationships while maintaining the action of the story, something extremely hard to do.

The Russo Brothers deliver the screenplay of a lifetime from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely; and boy the two duos that have single-handedly shaped the MCU into what it is today. They direct a star-studded cast featuring the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Peter Dinklage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo. That's only PART of the ensemble cast this film has to offer. And the story; my god the story and scale of this movie: IT'S INCREDIBLE; and it's basically a full-fledged space opera now!

Witty quips, Beatles references, a Flash Gordon quip from Peter Quill, it's just a great-great time at the movies. Infinity War is a space-opera with superheroes; and it's comparable to the likes of The Star Wars Trilogy, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and, (heck, maybe even) The Dark Knight Trilogy. This is cinema bursting at the seams; but it's GOOD bursting as opposed to muddled bursting (Suicide Squad is one such misfire). MARVEL; you've made quite the pay-off this time. Keep it up!", "I know this is just another super hero flick or maybe an eye candy for most of adult audiences; however, this movie is sure damn good. Acting, visuals, story were on point and it sure was worth my money and time to watch it in the theatre for 2hrs and 30mins! Don't listen to negative reviews or critics i assure you that if you are a serious or a casual movie goer, marvel fan or dc fan or whatever.. you will enjoy this movie from beginning to an end!", "SENSATIONAL, FUNNY, HEARTBREAKING, AWESOME! ILOVED this movie!!!  Now that's out the bag, let me get down to the grit. After 10 years and 18 movies, finally, the War is here! As a spectacle summer popcorn movie this has no equal, as a technical achievement, there is no better, as a moving relationship drama with real depth and threat, The only other time I have experienced anything close was the LOTR trilogy... its that good!  Yes, its safe to assume that I am a Marvel fan-boy and may be just a tad biased in my opinions, however, I always try to go into MCU movies with an open mind, never expecting what happens on screen to rival the many stories I have consumed over the decades in the books. This does, in every possible way.  Less politically relevant than Black Panther but with ten times more heart, as funny as Ragnarok but with a million times the threat this is the culmination of thousands of hours of hard work and devotion from a studio who not only know what they are doing but also clearly love what they do too, and it shows In every beautifully framed shot, every character interaction and every emotional death scene, right up to the cliffhanger to rival that of the first Matrix. The biggest surprise to me was Thanos. A genuine force of nature. The biggest bad in the MCU. The Mad Titan himself.... a loving father with a complicated back story and impossible decisions to make whilst carrying the fate of the universe on his vast shoulders! This is no doubt, 100% HIS movie. Brolin nails it, with the assistance of the best mo-cap in cinema history, he is able to convey a tortured, moving performance that resonates with the audience who can not help but almost agree with his logic, you almost want him to win! The rest of the ensemble cast are great as usual, the dynamics between the team-ups are superbly handled, especially the scenes with the Guardians, who, thanks to Drax, inject most of the humour. The Tony Stark/Peter Parker relationship also expands on the groundwork laid in Civil War and continued in Homecoming, to great effect. Tony, more than ever truly cares for Pete and as such feels a greater sense of responsibility than ever. With great power, right? Furthermore, the Wanda/Vision, Quill/Gamora, Rocket/Groot, relationships are all dealt with incredibly well, with heartfelt emotion and genuine love for each other. Trust me, there will be lumps in throats! on the flip side is Thor and Cap, who are both dealing with loss, Thor dealing with the destruction of Asgard and Steve with the state of the fractured Avengers, they are very much the 'solo' heroes, both with nothing to lose, both at their most dangerous. Dr Strange also plays a huge part in the narrative of the film, however, alongside Hulk, Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Black Panther, they are very much the window dressing to fill the gaps between the main event.  The pacing of the movie is spot on, it really never felt like 2 and a half hour film and had Avengers 4 started right after I could have probably sat (on the edge of my seat) through that too! If I had to find a negative it would probably be Hulk shaped, but that's really clutching at straws, this is an outstanding achievement and a milestone in cinema. Go see it. Go see it again, you will not be disappointed. I'm off to catch viewing number 3.", "There is no way back from this without some galactic undo button. If I wanted alternate timeline crap I'd be watching those sad Star Trek redoes. The premise is lamer than Civil War (which was heroes can't save everyone so government regulation to the rescue). Some idiot thinks because his world collapsed that either a) ALL civilizations will collapse in similar fashion and/or b) that galactic genocide solves the problem. I have left movies melancholy, brokenhearted, and terrified. I realize not all stories have a happy ending, but I've never left a movie ANGRY until now. Seriously Marvel...screw you.", "Visited today the long awaited first part of the avengers grand finale.  I was very pleased with what I saw. \nBrilliant looking CGI, strong story and a massive triple A cast. \nAnd of-course a lot of long action sequences that never got boring. Josh Brolin played an awesome bad guy Thanos who's explanation of his deeds\nactually made sense, and that is weird because the expectation was to hate \nthis guy. Here come the spoilers, I warned you.  Red Scull aka Hugo Weaving makes an appearance and that was really an exiting moment\nbecause it felt that he wasn't given enough screen time in the first Captain America.  And then we arrive to the moment where several Avengers get axed. \nAnd I actually only felt sorry for one of the choices. Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier.  The rest of the axed ones I always considered extra's anyway. \nFor example Black Panther, because of the extremely annoying media coverage \nThat his stand alone movie got I could not be any happier that his movie career got terminated quickly.  To know of other casualties go watch this epic movie, the current 9.3 imdb rating is fully deserved.", "I will only say that this movie is twice as long as it should be and has way too many characters. I won't even try to guess why they did that. I love Marvel and have a huge tolerance for bad movies, but by 29 minutes in I was ready to give up. If all the bad stuff had been cut out this would have been a great 90 minute movie.", "What a bad movie from marvel, it is not satisfying at all had many stars with a million place cutting off the story every 15 minutes.", "The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel.  This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh.  The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks \"all the same\".  On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer.  That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.", "'Infinity War' is overrated. It's entertaining, but I was expecting more. I can't even believe it's somewhere at the top of the best 250 movies list. The direction was OK, definitely not as good as some say, but the storyline was a bit of a mess. Each character was in a different planet fighting for different stuff. I think it was too risky wanting to put together so many superheroes in one movie. We didn't even get to see Captain America or Black Widow for more than 15-20 minutes, in a 2h30m long movie. I was also hoping for a more epic final battle, like in the first Avengers movie. This one was too short and messy. Maybe we'll get to see a better one in the next film. I still think the movie is for teenagers and kids...", "After building a plot for ten years, today we are at its peak. It's the culmination for those credit scenes that we waited in every MCU movie. I did bring my expectation for this movie. I always wondered how the Russo brother handled a movie with vast list of main characters. The result? They nailed it. Either Avengers and Guardians have their part perfectly. It's about balance, right? The opening part was predicted considering the end of Ragnarok last year. The rests are shown from the trailer but not in order and with several additional exciting scenes. Also, as we predicted, we found 'Thor-eyepatch' scene. It's a scene when there is a specific scene in a trailer but then changed in the final product.  Personally, I'm glad that Black Order is involved in the movie. Four of them didn't get any background story which is fine considering the runtime. However, they didn't have a proper death. Well, they had their purpose collecting stones for Thanos. But, only if they had a proper death, maybe they are rememberable. If you are expecting a totally dark theme movie, you will be disappointed. It has several funny jokes which bring smile on our face and I'm definitely fine with it. It's a way of life. If you have a sad event, a little smile would nice,right? It is reflected in Thor's scene with Rocket. He is making joke but deep down, you know that he is afraid and has unbearable sadness. As expected, there are deaths literally everywhere. It's chaotic. It shows that Thanos is someone that you should afraid of. For me, it's pretty dark movie. Not only because of the deaths, but also how the movie can scramble your emotion. Even though so many deaths, we were reunited with a certain character in Phase I of MCU. (Sure, it freaks me out) Conclusion. I'm still trembling when I write this. So exticed and sad when I come out from the theater. The part that I love the most is when Thanos snap his finger. I'm glad that it is happened like in the comic. But, I'm freaking sad when a lot of main characters died, especially Spidey. Literally, I'm crying in the theater. Well, it's beyond expectation. 10 of 10. And there's only one credit scene. Just wait. It's worth. A lot.", "I don't want to do spoiler but here's anything happy every body die in this movie\u00a1 I can say that the production its excellent but the movie it self the argument and end of the movie it the worts situation in all the marvel's movies, its terrible\u00a1 I cry\u00a1 this movie just have sadness and tears and funerals... since the start of the movie till the end you will cry\u00a1\u00a1", "Special effects are good but I didn't want to watch video game effects, totally not worth it.", "Thanos(Brolin, giving us a layered villain, the best in recent years) has...*finally*... started to gather the Infinity Gems. If he gets all six he can wipe out half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. Will our heroes be able to stop him and his \"Children\"? The hype for this was unreal. Many say that it couldn't live up to it. And I realise that a lot don't, and won't(as it premieres around the world), think it did. For my money(and they'll keep getting them as long as they keep making them this good), it delivered, and then some. Obviously, with so many major characters, they cannot possibly all get a lot of screentime. You could criticise their decision to include so many. Honestly, you're free to think so, but this is not a movie for you. Which is fine. I don't doubt that you love flicks that aren't for me. This is a cinematic version of an event comic, not decreased in scope as most of the adaptations of those stories are, something I've been waiting for for 20 years to be done right. So rather than complain about something that couldn't be helped, let's look at whether it's satisfying. Personally, I absolutely think so. I've loved most of these since I first saw these versions of them, and I felt that they were all featured to the right extent. Every single one of them makes an impact, most get arcs, not a single one feels like they're just in the background(as is the case with every single X-Men film). This wastes no time starting the plot, moves quickly, and introduces us to all the groups quite early on, and yet never feels overpowering. I realised the following is an old example, however, recently rewatching Revenge of the Sith, the difference is incredible. Both were built up to for years(at least 6 in both cases), and where that one is massively overcrowded, and quite tiring and tedious, this one isn't, even a little. I know. I can hardly believe it myself. It delivers on emotion, interaction between individuals, growth, in addition to action scenes(which, ultimately, is the bread and butter of a Summer blockbuster). Does it, outside of the bad guy's depiction, including personality and motivation, reach a level of depth akin to the solo adventures? No. It would be unrealistic to expect it to. It's not going for that. Finally, there has been a lot of reasonable concern, for how they would handle the supposed killing off of fan favorites. I'm not giving away whether or not they do, or if it's only for bit parts. What I will say is that everyone who kicks the bucket in this, on either side of the conflict, gets to be memorable and important before they do. They were very smart and how they handled that. Like everything else in this. I recommend this to anyone who finds it to be appealing. Do note that the ending is very much a setup for the next one, and doesn't feel conclusive. It used to be called part 1 for a reason. And yes, that will disappoint many - and they're not wrong. Personally, I'm just incredibly excited for Avengers 4. 10/10", "After telling people that I didn't really like this movie and, of course, getting attacked by every fanboy in the MCU I felt it necessary to put down a proper review. Let me start with the good so you know that I did not hate this movie. I actually enjoyed it. Infinity War is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The entertainment value comes to fighting is great, a couple of superhero saves that are utterly amazing, acting very solid, music great, visuals mostly fantastic, and the villain is mostly great too.\nIf you look at infinity war as a prelude to the end of the first big story-line of the MCU and if you look at it from a pure entertainment point of view this is by no means a bad movie, it is, from that perspective, darn good. Above sound like I loved this movie, right? So why didn't I? Because this movie has a few very, very big flaws, and it introduces a few concept and a bunch of additional McGuffins in a very hamfisted way and I do not think it completely nailed the landing. Let me elaborate. Let's start with Iron Man. So Tony, suddenly, and completely out of the blue, introduces his new Nano-tech suit. Where did that come from? When was that developed? Why never mention before? This tech is so immensely impressive that Iron Man go from being a strong hero to almost invincible. If it wasn't for fighting Thanos with the Gauntlet, Iron Man would win almost any fight against almost any opponent now. Sure it looks pretty cool and the Russo brothers make the best of it in the movie, but... what!? It actually pissed me off. Marvel has been very good at building up these things over time, over full movies, but here the nano-tech is just thrown in there because it looks cool. That is the only reason it is there, to make the visuals and the fight look cooler. Next up we have Vision and Scarlet Witch that, apparently, and also very suddenly, a couple and are sharing a bed together in some hotel room in Scotland.\nNow this was not completely out of the blue since it was sort of hinted at in both Civil War and Ultron, but them apparently sleeping together and being a couple in love!? What? I know they were/are a couple in the comics and if I remember correctly even have children together, so perhaps I should not be too surprised and upset over this development, but it makes no sense and it feels so rushed. In the context of the movie universe this is lazy writing, bad character development, and very forced upon us as viewers. Of course Captain America does a great save in a very nice entertaining way so I sort of forgot about this story hole upon first viewing, but it is not good writing. Not at all. Then we have Thor who, apparently, IS the God of Hammers. AND he gets an eye 25min into the movie, so that entire Ragnar\u00f6k story in regards to Thor's character development is thrown out the window.\nSidetrack: I actually hate Ragnar\u00f6k, I think it is, by far, the worst movie of the MCU. I think it is worse than Howard the Duck, worse than that awful Daredevil movie and worse then Elektra. Ragnar\u00f6k is the only MCU movie in par with (some) DCEU movies, that is how putrefied it is. However the only redeeming trait of Ragnar\u00f6k was the decent okayish character development of Thor that sort of work. But a few moments into Infinity War all of that is basically gone. He has an eye, and suddenly, after withstanding the blast of a star (haha..) he also have a new shiny ax. Then he summons the bifrost and with no knowledge about anything going on nor knowing where Wakanda is he poffs in there to save the day. That scene is absolutely fantastic, one of the best hero arrival ever and it is brilliantly entertaining, but it make no sense whatsoever. Again lazy writing or bad directing. I could go on pointing out so many other things like Red Skull showing up with no explanation, Gamora suddenly having half her planet alive (it was said before she was the last of her kind), StarLord flipping out (sort of understandable, but still...) and many other things in the movie that either demands background story or more explanation - stories and explanations we never get. What it all comes down to is either lazy writing or bad directing, probably a combo. The Russo\u00b4s have made very good movies before this. Civil War was very entertaining (and better than this movie) and Winter Soldier is as close to a masterpiece a superhero movie can get, but here they fail on several points. If it was just one character or one of the things I mention above (there are many more of these holes are missing pieces in the movie - take too long to list them all) it could be forgiven, but there are so many of them.\nI keep getting the feeling that they wanted to make a super-entertaining movie and a part One out of Two to end this saga, and they did so with little consideration for good writing.\nWhy not an exposition dump? A narration or two? Why not ignore one of the fights and slow down and explain things? No! We need entertainment! Boff! Poff! Blam! Isn't this fun!? Now I come to my final, and most significant objection to this movie, and also most likely the most unpopular opinion of this review. The villain, Thanos, I wrote above that; \"the villain is mostly great too\", but he is also completely weird and a really bad villain. Kill half the universe? Why?\nNever explained other than in his; \"I am a green party member and I want to kill folk because we use too many resources\" which is stupid beyond belief. How about double the number of planets? How about giving everyone a Star Trek replicator? How about clean energy? I hope his motivation is explained in Endgame, but if not he is just nuts, bonkers, crazy. In the comics his motivation was much, much more relevant and understandable, and that was crazy. And people complain that Captain Marvel is political? Really? This is the environment movement\u00b4s wet dream, nothing else. To summerize; this should be called McGuffin War because they fight over McGuffins with their own McGuffins and we get introduced to new McGuffins, out of nowhere, to counteract other McGuffins. And when Thanos finally collect all of his McGuffins he kills half the universe because we drive too many cars...\nIt is lazy writing, and bad storytelling. Sure it looks great, and all those explosions are nice, and oh boy all those McGuffins are fun and entertaining, but does that make a great movie? Is this really fantastic? No. To me this movie belongs in the mid- to low range of the MCU. There is a reason why Iron Man, Winter Soldier, and now also Captain Marvel, are the best movies of this franchise; because they are character driven stories. Sure those also have faults, and are perhaps not as entertaining as McGuffin War, but they are better movies because we get exposition, explanations, and we get to follow the characters in a logical well executed way. McGuffin war is just 2hrs and 30min of high-speed entertainment. It is almost like a Transformers movie, only better acted. And that is why I give this movie a 6/10. If Endgame do not explain some of the things I mention above I am most likely not going to like that movie either. BUT if it does, this movie probably need to be seen in a different light and I might need to up the score, but as of now it does not deserve a higher score. Edit: Since Endgame was horrible trash and explained absolutely nothing of McGuffin War it made also this movie worse. Endgame sucked so hard it was almost Justice League bad, and although McGuffin War was not as bad I have to reduce the score to 3/10. The Russo brothers should be banned from cinema for all time.", "After 10 years, marvel still makes their fans wait another year by bridging this movie to yet another movie. Same old stuff from marvel. They have become the Starbucks of the superhero genre. The basic b*tch.", "Good visual effects and good sound but a very bad script full of many bad jokes, this movie is a 10 for the fans of Marvel but for the rest of the world it is a 6 or 5.\nDisney please stop making movies.", "This movie has very little substance to it. It is basically the same thing over and over. Some combat starts, it almost ends badly but somebody comes to the rescue.  As all marvel movies, the heroes are always just as strong as they need to be for any particular situation and never actually use their powers when they could be useful.  The end is kind of cool but it will almost certainly be ruined by the next movie.", "Now, I know this is a movie and they can't afford to bring in every hero in the Marvel Universe, but when you are facing a foe that can potentially destroy half the universe at will, you'd think they'd make a few more phone calls? Hulk easily defeated in a fist fight then won't emerge for the entire movie. Convenient. His strength is supposed to scale with his emotions and he would have come in handy for the attempt to remove Thanos' gauntlet. Captain America who is supposed to be the maximum of _human_ potential, is seen leaping 15-20 feet into the air, right alongside a vibranium dosed Black Panther in his kinetic charged nanosuit. No human can jump that high. Scarlet Witch is uprated several levels from previous movies and is now incredibly powerful. She shows new uses of her powers (feasible accounting training time) and is able to hold Thanos at bay for a good ten seconds (really?), but is waylaid and absent for most of the fighting. Thor is now able to survive the vacuum of space, a ship exploding around him and the directed energy of a star. He gets a large portion of screen time carrying the movie along with Dr Strange, who fights pretty darned well. Vision seems to have suffered a bad firmware update. He went from a Thor's hammer wielding, head laser shooting, AI powered juggernaut to a weeping, emotional wreck. His energy attack is derated to flashlight levels. He manages a few weak tosses but no display of strength like before. Iron Man receives a big serving of long deserved humble pie. His technology doesn't pack nearly the punch it did before. His suit is promptly wrecked and he is sidelined, which was actually refreshing compared to previous titles where he kept going no matter how badly his gear was damaged. Groot is a sullen teenager with his head buried in a video game for 95% of the movie. He does wake up and pull his weight spearing enemies in the larger battle.", "One time watch movie.Hype is very bt very disgusting movie", "You just killed half of the most loved characters. I quit!", "Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan?  The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (\"Stop Thanos\"), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far. I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.", "Where do I start? I think I might start with all the big-headed people who have taken the time to badly criticize this movie. How can you honestly sit there and complain; 1/10, plot holes, it's like watching Harry Potter, too much CGI, I was hoping it would be more like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Come on give me a break!  How else would you do it? Let me guess, animation? How would you 'critics' align space, planets, action scenes, battles, every superhero character, character development and their individual super powers etc. with the marvel comic books? It's a superhero movie for god sake! of course there's going to be plot holes, it's a big job trying to bring all the characters together in one move, hence the 3 or so hours.  The Avengers finally have a worthy villain, and unfortunately it will take a few sacrifices along the way to defeat the great Thanos. I also honestly believe half the characters haven't yet died, that would just ruin the franchise and Infinity War movies all together. I have a gut feeling Dr Strange has something to do with it, I could be wrong but just don't believe the latter would occur.  Come one guys stop over analyzing things, relax enjoy it for what it is. \n \nThis movie has it all drama, suspense, despair, bravery, courage, sacrifice, humour, anguish, I can go on. I'm an avid movie watcher, have seen every Marvel movie there is, I collect Marvel comics $10,000 worth, i'm also an artist and a writer, so like to think my opinion is worth something. Well done Marvel, keep bringing them out....", "There are two types of stories where the hero doesn't save the day. Horror and documentary - horror because the villian is far too powerful to begin with, but even then is usually thwarted by the last of the survivors it has chosen to torment. The other is documentaries, because they are based on real events - but usually the heroes win, because they write the histories.\nThis film is neither and while others applaud the boldness of letting half of the universe get snuffed out, I would say that if the studio was truly bold it would not release another film featuring the characters it so casually got rid of. As it is, this 'boldness' costs them nothing more than thinking of some BS excuse to bring them back, and we are all the poorer for it, for if they can be brought back once, why not twice? Why not over and over again? Death has no meaning to these heroes, they'll be back as long as writers can dream up an excuse.\nFurther, I object to Thanos' loony idea. Kill five billion people on Earth (half is less but then there are airline pilots that disappeared, people killed in traffic because of crashes, etc. etc. Within 100 years, the population will be pushing 8 billion again. He hasn't stoped the problem, merely delayed it for a little while.\nHowever, the problem isn't even real. Thomas Malthus published his 'Essay on the Principle of Population' in 1798 predicting that people would run out of food - yet today, we produce far more food than we can use (even if it was sent to feed the hungry in areas of famine).\nFinally, Thanos doesn't even have the courage of his convictions. If he believed that it was for the good of the universe, he should have volunteered that he be the first taken. The fact that he isn't means that he doesn't believe and is also a coward.\nTruly this is the worst of the Marvel films to date.", "Like all other marvel movies. Only this time they stretched the movie so much they need two movies. Every time the heroes are going to lose but at the end they win, i bet in part two the heroes still win and everybody who vanished will return. So i think the story is weak, but for a marvel movie my time was well spend.", "How can you think this film \"touches the heart\" while the plots offered at all have no elements that can be said to be \"human\"? This is just a film of a group of super-heroes that are very confusing, too many plot changes and stacking of hero characters, the storyline is mediocre and imposing to dramatic? The end of the film is forced enough to hang very strange and unclear? How can you be forced to \"wait\" for the continuation of an unclear story? One thing is certain, Avenger's will take revenge and win right in the next film? Think of it that way. But this Infinity Wars movie is really boring. If I can compare it, then the LOGAN movie (another superhero movie) is more emotionally touching, human sentimental. But it not ever happen with this film. Only entertainment films, which are made with the aim of making a profit, with a messy plot. Not recommended for connoisseurs of good movies, but please for super hero worshipers. I hate my 2 hour and half gone to watching movie like this.", "Avengers Infinity War wasn't a film I was overly bothered about seeing, but my friend drags me to all of the superhero films, none of which I've found to be very interesting. Since the first Iron Man film (which was a pleasant surprise) these films have become more and more formulaic. This one has huge ambition by throwing every single Marvel superhero into the mix. If you love these characters then this is probably all your cinematic dreams come true. However if you're just a fan of good movies then this might well leave you cold. On the positive side of things, it's very impressive that the filmmakers have assembled so many characters and given them all something to do, but it comes across like Wacky Races with 50 characters. It's kind of fun for a while but as more and more characters are introduced it becomes harder to care. And the plot, well, it's a problem. On the one hand they've kept it really simple by having one major bad guy (with a couple of sidekicks who show up now and again). And as is usually the case in these films, it's a maguffin chase. All of these big budget franchises have been using this lazy plot line for ages now. Thanos (the villain) needs to find a bunch of coloured stones to wear on his glove. And if he gets them all then it will mean the end of the world, universe, blah blah (same thing as the ring in LOTR, or the cube in Transformers, and most other big movies like this where everyone is after a magical artefact). The problem is, these magic stones don't really do anything. They just have nice names and the bad guy has to find them at any cost. That's your whole plot in a nutshell. So to try and keep the audience engaged the filmmakers have decided that an overbearing soundtrack will tell you how to feel at every crucial moment in the film. And it's almost always the same thing - Character X is about to die (cue tragic sad music). A long drawn out sequence takes place where X says goodbye to someone. These scenes (which are repeated every ten minutes or so) either end with another avenger showing up to save the day (cue triumphant music) or X is killed / left to die by the bad guys. But because this is a superhero film and most of these characters are big cash cows, you know that they're not really dead. They're coming back, sometimes twenty minutes later. After a while the constant \"don't let me die\" scenes get beyond ridiculous, but I suppose if you're a kid and haven't seen this done a million times before, it might be \"amazing\". On the other hand, if you're an adult and you've seen this done enough times to know how it plays out, this becomes tedious really quickly. And the overbearing soundtrack telling you how to feel at all times, smacks of desperation from a studio that knows they have too many characters in the film and not enough time to make a casual viewer care about them, so the manipulative music is added in instead to trick you into feeling whatever they want you to feel. Even though I didn't enjoy this film, I think they've done a great job of making it look fantastic. And every character gets their allotment of screentime without the pace of the story ever slowing down, but what you have is a 2 hour 15 minute action film with no downtime, probably in the hopes that younger viewers won't notice the absence of a proper story. To summarise, this is great for fans, but probably boring for anyone else.", "In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present. This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years). The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts. Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work.  At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one. (If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)", "Terrible CGI, so many plot holes, I almost fell asleep in the theater because of how boring movie was, all the characters going to come back so they can make more money off of this stupid franchise. Adventures infinity war is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen it is a cluster of characters that I used to care about, not anymore.", "Warning, this review contains a rant with lots of exclamation marks! Okay, so yesterday evening, my youngest daughter and I had some pizza, and were looking for something to watch on television. I couldn't find anything, so I looked to purchase a movie from one of the digital movie streaming websites. I looked on on THIS movie database (because I used to trust it), and with a score of 8.6 and so many initial 10/10 reviews, I went against my better judgement and purchased the digital copy of Avengers: Infinity War for \u00a313.99. That's the last time I trust THIS movie database! I felt hoodwinked, and most definitely conned. This morning I had another look at the reviews, and observed that after the initial 10/10s, the rest of the reviews were 1/10. In retrospect, whilst this website perpetuates itself as having integrity in its reviews/ratings, it is my opinion that it is little more than a mechanism for generating sales for movies that under normal word-of-mouth conditions would tank. I feel so angry with myself. The movie itself is a mish-mash of many different themes, and tries way too hard to be serious. I don't watch these movies for that - if I want serious, I'll watch Heat, Goodfellas or any other number of good thrillers. Why oh why would Marvel screw with the feel good formula of 'Guardians of the Galaxy'? To sum up, it is my opinion that Avengers: Infinity War should have failed, but didn't - largely due to the manipulation of reviews and information. And I doubt very much if this interference of information was made for free! If you believe the Avengers are a real, you might actually like this movie - everyone else will likely feel a little low. And to be honest, who needs that in this day and age? If you want to watch some misery, save your money and watch the news instead!", "This movie was an overrated summer blockbuster. There was no substance what so ever. This was supposed to be the climactic end of the saga but instead I'm typical marvel fashion they end on a cliff hanger.  Of course they're just going to keep pumping out garbage so long as all the people who gave this a 10 and raved about and and continue paying to watch the same movie over and over", "When I started watching this seemingly endless drag of a movie, I was expecting some of the magic that this franchise has had in the past. It wasn't to be. Instead, we got familiar character after familiar character, each doing their characteristic throw-away joke.  No drama was involved; at no time did I ever think any of the far-too-many stars that were involved were in any danger, or that anything bad could happen; it was all slight-of-hand, all CGI trickery that looks impressive when there's just a bit of it. Here were great heaping glops of it. Acting? None that I could discern, it was all throw-away lines from throw-away characters. These cardboard characters looked better on the cardboard box!  At first I thought of giving this piece of garbage a score of 2/10; but really, this movie is so very bad, and so damaging to the franchise, that a 1/10 is well deserved. It would be lower if I could make it so. This is a throw-away movie. Very young children and the extremely easily impressed by green-screen effects may like this film, but don't look for a plot or story; it's got lots of familiar faces though. It would have done so much better if it had a decent script-writer! Alas, that was not deemed necessary.", "No story bad ending....they only made this movie to collect money with no intention to entertain the people...I'm so disappointed", "\"Avengers\": Infinity War\" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.", "Quite disappointed. Too much going on, too many heroes to follow. Who is the protagonist? Iron Man? Thor? Star Lord? Dr. Strange? Who do I follow? All of them? They have tried to recreate the impact of the original avengers when they all join up but times by 5. Unfortunately it flops. I will watch Endgame because I have already committed this much but just have to say Stan Lee should not have signed off on any of this.", "Overkill on so many levels.Too many characters, too many worlds, too many explosions. I found there were so many deaths that in the end even when a character I really liked died I had no emotional response. Also too many times, before he had the full set of rings that Thanos could have been shot but no, everyone politely waited until he was aware of their presence (eg when he is talking to Gomorra and Star Lord is standing there with a loaded gun doing nothing!!!). I cried at the end of GOTG 2 when Yondu died, but this movie almost trivialised death, it was an emotionally vacant experience. I love both Marvel and DC universes but this missed in too many ways to be engaging, Justice League a clear winner. a final thought, the music was also draggy which didn't help, I came out thinking I may well see the follow up on DVD. My favourite bits were the different groups meeting each other and finding out that Thor speaks Groot. My advice to Marvel studios, you seem to focus on Iron Man a lot, he is an unlikeable character, choose someone else as your lead and maybe that would help audience engagement, certainly would mine. But again Tom Hollander as Spider Man is just perfect.", "WARNING: SPOILERS!! Honestly I don't even know where to begin. This is literally the biggest disappointment in the entire MCU. I wish this was a gigantic late April fools joke, because this movie is a joke, and isn't worthy to be the culmination of 10 years of mostly fantastic movies.", "Loved it . Worth waiting ten years for . Can't wait for part 2", "Suspenseful al the way through to the end. I did not like how wakanda was just used just as battleground it could have meant more but other than that I loved the movie", "I can't understand why you guys liked this movie, it's just superhero turmoil. Just can be watch to waste spare time. I must admit that movie's graphics are awesome but movie isn't made up just with graphics.", "I usually don't write reviews but thistime I felt compelled to. I was always a fan of the classic avenger s movies and the side movies and i thought one big collab if you will would be epic. But this was a muddled too fast paced big ball of a mess. Just killing of characters small jokes and love interest interactions does not save it in the least. The characters that died off like it was nothing deserved a better or more significant death. All in all this was beyond chaotic and terrible.", "Summary:\nInfinity war has all the elements of the old trusted Disney recipe. Mediocre to bad comedy, stupid story, flat characters, political correct and kids friendly style. If you loved Thor Ragnarok , you will love this one. It's only major difference is that there is much less Hulk in this one. In Detail: The good thing about the film is that it brings all our favorite marvel superheroes together without feeling overcrowd and giving each one of them its own role in the film without using him or her as mere decorations. The ending although partly expected, it has a good deal of surprise. Overall however the film suffers from a ton of issues: 1) The elephant in the room is Thanos himself, he suffers from the same issues as Steppenwolf in JL. As a villain he is everything you expect to see, a bad guy wanting to do bad things. Their only difference is that dialogue wise Steppenwolf takes the edge with some really unique lines, Thanos takes the edge of having a bit more complex plan. But overall this is a \"what you see is what you get\" situation for both of and sadly they also both suffer from the plastic face CGI issue. Overall much of the motivation of Thanos makes little sense and the film does not seem able to decide the most basic whether Thanos is mad or plain stupid. 2) Hulk has been a big issue in all Disney films but never as much as in this one. He is pretty much non existent in this film , gone are his old days of \"we have a hulk\" , maybe there is a reason a surprise element left for the sequel but after Disney turning Hulk to this big cute meatball wrecking havoc depriving him of his Marvel identify of the stuff of nightmares and horrors , my hopes are very low on this one.  3) Disney of course does not stop there at destroying any link with the comics, an art they have perfect since the first movie they made. Thor for some weird reason is completely overpowered. The guy that barely made it alive from a fight with the Hulk in Thor Ragnarok , the first fight he discovers the peak of his powers , seems unlike Hulk to have no issues whatsover taking Thanos by himself. Why ? Again none knows. 4) Spiderman once more is reduced to Iron Man's sidekick. His role in the flim is completely unnecessary , even though he does indeed participate and contributes his own powers this film, these powers are like Homecoming extremely town down. His insane agility is long gone, his spider sense just a shadow of the one in the comics and of course what remains is his high reliance on his armor of course made by tony. Essentially if Iron Man is Dr Evil, Spiderman is Mini Me. It's pretty obvious that Disney is pitching Spiderman as the new Iron Man , although Holland acting skills are nowhere near those of RDJ. 5) Comedy was always the weakest part of Marvel films. Usually its a hit and miss situation, throw random jokes on the wall , see which one sticks. This film manages to be even worse than Thor Ragnarok. Some very good jokes, most of them you see them coming miles away.  6) For me Hulk was not the big surprise on how underpowered he was but Dr Strange. Marvel has already establishes that he can run circles around Thor and Loki combined , yet in this one he seems to display a tiny fraction of his abilities 7) Which brings us to another problem stemming from this inconsistency, action scenes. None of the fight scenes are really exciting, the most exciting is nothing more than a recycle from a similar scene in Thor Ragnarok.  8) Last but not least, character development is non existent. Infinity War seems to follow Civil War but again there is no discussion on the big gap that it left to the team, the film starts with an indication that it may address the issue but then as soon as Thanos visits our planet, its no longer an issue. Disney logic at its best. All my fears since watching the trailer have been confirmed and I would be surprised if the sequel is the first superhero movie not bothering to watch.", "One of the best movie with a fantastic story line, must watch and lots of surprises. Loved it", "I've been waiting for this movie to come out for forever now. I was afraid it was going to be terrible; if it was, then that would be a surprise. Marvel movies have been at the top for years now, and this is the peak. I was so excited to see all these characters meet for the first time and take down Thanos. For me, this is the best way to introduce the Infinity War story. There was so much characters and subplots, and there was no pacing issues and the story didn't get lost in itself. This movie could've been three hours plus, but putting it all together in two hours thirty minutes is a real achievement. I was never bored too; there was action right in the beginning to the end. I know a lot of the non-comic moviegoers are going to hate this movie, because they had no idea that Thanos would kill everyone, luckily I knew what was going to happen. I think it was a hard decision for Marvel to take this direction; due to the criticism of the naive moviegoers, salute to Marvel. The thing is, if Marvel never explained all of the characters, then this could've ended up as a failure. We knew all of the characters and plots. Marvel explained every bit to the audience through multiple movies. Marvel took their time to explain and not confuse the audience. DC didn't do that with Justice League, there was no hype for that, because there were no \"Multiple movies\". Story: 10/10 There are six Infinity Stones, each stone was explained throughout every Marvel movie (Excluding the X-Men universe). We knew everything there has to be known about the Infinity Stones and the subplots, because of the \"Multiple movies\". This movie is subplot galore, and a lot of movies suffer from that, but this movie doesn't. All the subplots made the Marvel universe more interesting and exciting. For anyone who doesn't fully understand the plot, Thanos has to collect six Infinity Stones from around the universe, if he gets it, then goodbye to the superheros, and that's what happens in this movie. Most of the superheros are gone, it's up for the rest to end Thanos. There was no pacing issues, as I said before. I was never confused of what was happening; the plot stayed on its tracks the entire movie. We also saw Thanos collect each Infinity Stone, except for one. I liked seeing Thanos collect all these Infinity Stones while seeing the superheros band up together, it really builds up the the climax. Overall, the plot stayed steady, there wasn't too many plot holes, the story is action packed, fun, and exciting. \nCharacters: 10/10 I loved all of the characters. Each one had their own movie to star in, which made them even more exciting to see them team up. For me, Thanos was perfect. They made Thanos strong and \"Merciless\". Thanos was such a good villain because he didn't fail to kill superheros, and that's what he did in this movie. If a villain managed to do nothing, then he's a bad villain, but Thanos managed to complete his mission. Every character was interesting, and they had their own part to play in this movie. Each character and setting was explained so perfectly in this movie, and in other Marvel movies. One of the newer characters is Eitri (Peter Dinklage). Peter Dinklage was the perfect choice for Eitri. Dinklage is such a good actor; he can really play any role. I would also like to see Eitri join the rest of the Avengers to end Thanos, that would be great. Since there's so much characters in a two hour thrity minute movie, some characters don't get that much screen time. I wanted to see more Black Panther, he was only helpful at the end of the movie. Overall, every character had their own role to play in the story, Thanos was perfect in this movie, but some characters didn't get that much screen time than others. Action: 10/10 A lot of long movies like, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Blade Runner 2049 suffer from one important issue; the boredom. A lot of long movies feel long because there isn't enough action to keep the audience satisfied, but Avengers: Infinity War had no problem. None of the characters had to be explained and none of the major plots had to be explained, it was all action. This movie really used the power of CGI, and there was no problem. Sometimes having a CGI villain can ruin the villain itself, but the voice acting by Josh Brolin was good enough to make this CGI villain believable. The climax of the movie is one of the strong parts of this movie. Seeing most of the superheros work together for the first time is like rewatching the climax of Avengers (2012). But not all of the superheros were fighting the alien army. The other superheros were fighting Thanos. Overall, there was constant action, the CGI was on point, but I expected a slightly better final fight. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War was perfect for me. I loved the story, the characters, and the action. I was afraid that Marvel would do something wrong, but everything was perfect. I really hope Marvel can keep up with the good work, but Venom scares me. Venom, in my opinion doesn't look that good for a Marvel movie, and I really want this Marvel hot streak to continue. There is one minor issue; there wasn't enough Hulk. I wanted to see Hulk in the final battle, but he was just in the Hulkbuster suit, which is ironic. Avengers: Infinity War was funny too, which isn't surprising. I strongly recommend Avenger: Infinity War, it's the Perfect Marvel movie, with lovable characters, laughs, and the constant action.", "It feels like a series of related, high-level commercials. It never stops, always wanting to make an impact right-away, never allowing time for things to grow. Mostly by blowing stuff up, but in all other aspects, too. Humor is a bunch of one-liners. Growth (by, say, Teenage Groot) is an \"event\" - \"from a tablet-playing teenager to a hero in 1.4 seconds\". When it does try to break that pattern, mostly w/Thanos, it doesn't do much, merely stretches the time-base, taking things into slow-motion, yet still the same low amount of things actually happen. Not to mention that men show more emotion than women in this movie. Methinks #TimesUp for this silly feminism already. The biggest problem is the finale, where any semblance of sense is lost, especially since we know Spider-Man and Black Panther have planned sequels, so, their \"deletion from existence\" at the end will not last. Hopefully it will not be some big \"time-reversal\" event, or this will start to look way too much like comics. Bottom line, it's watchable, but not very good, worse than original Avengers and, while different, of similar overall quality with Age of Ultron.", "It's like Transformers, but with a story intact! All the Transformers movies were epic to me, but as the sequels came, the stories got more and more lost. Not Avengers: Infinity War. As an ex-comic collector (over 15 years), I was quite well acquainted with Thanos. My biggest worry was how they were going to pull off a weird looking hulk of an alien like him and not make him look like a doofus. Pulled off they did. Thanos was convincing and menacing, but most importantly he felt \"real\". Of course, no one can fault the fantastic, solid cast in the Avengers - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, etc. (though I missed Hawkeye) were all rock-solid and it's amazing how their characters shined through despite the very very full cast of the Marvel Universe. The action was epic - this is where it reminds me of Transformers - where the CGI was fantastic, blended well, etc. The difference? Infinity War had a rock-solid story that tied in all the characters really well, and it had a whole raft of emotions - funny, sad, poignant, shocking, surprising, mindblowing moments all came through the movie. It is one truly epic movie that deserves to be on the big screen. I love it, and can't wait for the next part. Highly, highly recommended.", "The hype train behind this movie was insane. You should have been there, it was such a ride. We were losing our minds at this image, and crying over that shot from the trailer, and speculating about every little thing. It was something special to behold. So now that this gargantuan movie is here, was it worth it? Was all that hype warranted or did it all go to waste? I'll say what I can here, but to put it simply, this film gave me everything I wanted and more. Guess I'll just start with the bad, because no movie is truly perfect, and this one is no exception. There's one shot in the beginning between Tony and Pepper that constantly blurs in and out of focus, which I would guess is a problem with the whole thing being shot with IMAX cameras. They're great for the action scenes but really poor for scenes of two people talking. I don't think they do enough with the characters they're given, mainly because I've followed Marvel movies religiously for close to 8 years now and would have just loved to see all the witty banter they go through. And yet there's not too much of that. You have all these A list actors, and you do... pretty much nothing with them. A little annoying but whatever. There is stuff, but to me they could have gone farther still. And the last issue is the Soul Stone. They throw it in, but I'm guessing only for fanservice and to go through with the ending. The problem is we've been looking for the Soul Stone for 6 years now and no one knows, and now it's Gamora who's known this whole time? Yeah, that's kinda an issue. Really all that stuff is me nitpicking. What this movie doesn't do so well here or there it makes up for in spades with all this really cool stuff. Every action scene is superb. And trust me, there's a *lot* of action scenes. There's one at the start, then there's another in New York, then there's another on the ship thing, and another in Switzerland or wherever, and a really big one on Titan, and a really *really* big one on Wakanda. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say the whole movie is one fight scene honestly. And not just one long boring fight scene, they do so many wonderfully amazing things in it that saying anything here kinda defeats the purpose. The characters don't need too much more fleshing out, as we already know who these people are from other movies. And that was really my biggest concern going in, that they would give everyone an extra backstory. But the film goes, \"you should know who these guys are by now, don't expect us to waste precious time on them.\" The only character this really happens to is Gamora, but she never had that big of a backstory to begin with, so it doesn't truly matter. Besides, she dies anyways. And not just at the end, which I was surprised by. Speaking of the end... I love it. It's so bold and brave of Marvel to literally erase every character we've cared about for the last 6 years. The only people that end up alive are the original six (I'm going with Hawkeye/Antman being Schrodinger's Cat, where they are both alive and dead until further notice), Rocket, War Machine, and Nebula. And I agree with it, mainly because deep down we all know Avengers 4 is probably going to undo at least part of the damage. Peter Parker dying isn't the end of Spiderman, because Spiderman is a suit, not a person. (STILL WAITING ON MILES MARVEL). Dr. Stephan Strange, Sorcerer Supreme dying isn't the end, Sorcerer Supreme is a title. T'Challa dying isn't the end of Black Panther, they've already announced a sequel within like a month of his movie, and besides, Black Panther is just another title. A kingly status, not a person. I love the ending just because of the sheer ambition and bold choice made, but not everyone did clearly, as I could tell people walked out really really sad. I don't blame them, it sucks seeing them die. But that's exactly why they did it. Thanos is the coolest villain Marvel villain... ever really. I'd say better than Loki, better than Ego (whom I've learned to love), better than Michael Keaton that one time, better than literally every Marvel villain. He steals the show, and in a way you can understand his thought process. He thinks what he's doing is right, wiping out half the universe so that the last half have a better, more prosperous life. And in the end he wins, and his ambition is realized. Was what he was doing right in the end? To him maybe, to us maybe. And every fight scene involving him, except maybe the very very last one where he walks up to Vision and just kinda blows through the remaining force through sheer over-leveled might was absolutely fantastic. He is far too powerful, but everyone against him puts up one hell of a fight. So I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I can tell a lot of other people did as well. It's not a perfect movie, honestly to me Iron Man 1, Guardians (both), Avengers 1, and Dr. Strange are still better, and none of those top Dark Knight, but still. I love this movie. And you should too, if you've been like me for the past year. Go watch it at your earliest possible convenience!.. just remember to bring tissues.", "What a terrible film. no story. hysterical action. awfull", "Avengers: Infinity War is the culmination of everything the MCU has shown us since the first Iron Man. And it's a massive disappointment. The movie boasts more characters in a single comic movie than ever before, and that's where one of the biggest problems comes in. There are too many characters and it causes pacing issues, where they ramp through exposition as fast as possible to move on. Some characters barely do anything and are just there because they are supposed to be. Thanos is an okay villain. Not \"Vader X 10\" like they told us. But it's not hard to be a better villain than we've seen before when the MCU has had lame villains for 10 years. There are multiple character deaths in the movies. But the \"Emotion\" and \"Drama\" of seeing them die is artificial, since you know they aren't leaving these characters dead and their deaths will be retconned in Part 4 next year. Some of the characters who \"Die\" have movies on the release slate for the next few years, so Feige and the Russo Bros. promising the deaths would be permanent is a lie since we know that *SPOILER ALERT* Spider-man, Black Panther, Gamora, Bucky, Groot, Mantis, Drax, Black Panther, War Machine, and Falcon aren't going to stay dead. The jokes are cringey as usual and it causes an inconsistent tone. They don't know what they want the movie to be. A comedy? A serious movie? There is so much action in this movie, and it exposes the hypocrisy of critics. After years of hearing them whine about too much action in some of the DC movies the final 45 minutes to an hour of Infinity War is pretty much all action, which the positive reviews show they suddenly have no issues with. The movie was a disappointment. And people attack DC movies while giving movies like this a pass. It's stupid. Justice League was a mess but let's be honest with ourselves. WB let Joss Whedon butcher that movie because they wanted to pander to the critics who love brainless quipfests like what the MCU puts out on a regular basis. We never got to see the real version of Justice League. So my question is, why are DC movies fair game but we're supposed to just pretend garbage like Infinity War are masterpieces? The MCU is exhausted. They are out of ideas so this movie became a cheap gimmick to try to prove that it's not just basic parodies and they are desperate to prove how \"deep\" they can be and how much \"risk\" they're willing to take. But how much risk is there in doing things that you know will be undone in the very next movie? It renders the entire movie pointless when you know that it's just a set-up for the finale instead of standing on it's own. The CGI was pretty subpar in some scenes. Showing off mid-2000s level CGI in some areas, which is just sad in a movie released in 2018. Say what you will about the effects in Justice League, but that movie underwent unnecessary reshoots and that caused the effects to not be as polished in some scenes. So what is Marvel's excuse for this, especially as massive as the budget for this movie was? Some of the action was really good, but overall the movie was like when you go to a restaurant and you just happen to get the food that's dry and has been sitting out for a bit. It's okay but you walk out regretting spending the money on something that you know could have been more but the people who worked on it knew they didn't really have to try to still make money off you. Had it's moments, but ultimately a let down. 3/10", "The writing was so bad. Too many characters, horrible humor and one liners. It was cringeworthy. Just a bunch of mindless fights and battles we've seen a million times before and then the cringeworthy exposition and bad acting slowed down, low tone, over dramatic speeches. Evil man or group wants to destroy the world and just before they succeed they are stopped by the super hero(s). Seen one you've seen them all.\nSKIP!!", "How is this movie rated #51 of imdb all time? It's a terrible movie with the premises of obtaining stones to put on a glove to end the world. And the ending is silly as all other Marvel movies have been announced so it doesn't matter who survives and who doesn't. I didn't enjoy this movie. It's almost as if you're playing a video game or watching your friend play a game while you watch.", "Antother Marvel flick and a bad one indeed. CGI is very good. Standard these days but the rest....simply unwatchable. Completely insane story like so many other movies....", "Yea, Infinity War is not a bad movie, it's semi-fun.. but that's about it..  The acting was good, the CGI was good.. but the story is too simple and straightforward.. i can't understand why anyone older than 18-19 would be raving about this movie..", "When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film. Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking. Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future. The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark. They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.", "I've grown up with these films. I've grown to love them, I've grown to love the characters. This film delivers. No joke, I'm still sobbing after the ending. This deeply and emotionally affected me. I can't imagine what a feat this must be for the Russo brothers, but I salute to them. This movie is borderline perfect in my eyes. DCEU is over. Pack up your bags DC. Thank you Marvel.", "Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic blockbuster that scratches that superhero itch you've felt since its trailer. With a cast as big as Thanos and action that blows you back into your seat, it's hard not to re-queue when the film is over. \nUnlike the destruction caused by Loki in the first film and Ultron in the second, with this film, Thanos brings a whole new definition of threat. The heroes' greatest battle begins here and the special effects, acting, emotion and intertwining story arcs make for an exiting Marvel experience. \nThe humour element was well balanced, unlike the changing trend with some of the latest Marvel instalments, and the chemistry between characters seemed authentic. I do admit, however, that some scenes seemed disjointed and proved to block the flow of the narrative - a minor nit-picking issue. The pacing of the film flowed well and at no point, in the 2.5 hours, did I feel bored. \nInfinity War is a high-octane, action-fueled, amazing instalment that succeeds in living up to its insane fan hype.  The Internet is a harsh wasteland, and spoilers are out there, tread carefully!! 9/10", "I was super excited to see this film, but from the second I started watching it, I got the feeling that it was going to go absolutely nowhere.\nTo my surprise, I was right with there endless fighting for essentially nothing, with such stupid holes in the plot where characters really, could've easily done something to prevent Thanos from destroying half of the population of the universe. \nThis movie was so dragged out over this two and a half hours, that I was expecting and NEEDING an ending where something meaningful ACTUALLY happened.\nThere was really nothing that happened, it was so stretched out that I just wanted to exit the movie inbetween or skip parts out.\nPoor, this is not like Marvel...", "A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him. I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys. For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything... The final\u00e9, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene). 6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it. ***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***", "It did not live up to my expectations AT ALL! I didn't cry, I didn't laugh. And why did Thanos get so much more screen time than the Avengers? It's the AVENGERS movie, not the Thanos movie! Needless to say I am MAJORLY disappointed and dissatisfied. The actors are great, the characters were executed fine, the plot pissed me off. Every joke ruined every potentially emotional scenes. Of all the scenes, the ending was what bothered me the most. The very few parts I liked from the movie was the post credit scene, Doctor Strange, Iron Man and Black Panther. Others either died or just didn't stand out. Go watch Black Panther or Wonder Woman. Don't waste your life and money on this trash. People are trying to make this movie as if this is the next Shawshank Redemption and I'm sick of it. Really!? Top 10 best movie!? Get the hell out of here.", "FIRSTLY: This review was up for months before it was unceremoniously taken down. The submission page says it was declined for 'unspecified reasons' - but this happened months after it was approved, with hundreds of people having weighed in on its helpfulness. There are no spoilers. There are no R-rated cuss words. There is no racism, sexism, or any other kind of hate-mongering. Maybe IMDB has a problem with reviews suggesting that a film is so lame that the audience needs be in a state of chemically-induced mind-alterment to enjoy it. I don't know. I've seen that in plenty of reviews, but I took that bit out of the title this time around, and will only encourage good ole America-approved alcoholism from now on. In any case, taking down perfectly reasonable reviews with no explanation and no accountability - especially for major studio titles like this - is simply unacceptable. Folks, what do you want to see here, in the user reviews? Do you want a bunch of grade school quality shillery from fake studio puppet accounts? Or do you want REAL people to write what they REALLY think? Because apparently, it's not just shills we have to worry about - there is definite financial incentive for the mods to delete negative reviews of major studio releases. Because even a hundred lazy shill reviews cannot counteract the power of one scathing, honest review - and the shills can be spotted from a mile away, especially if you look at a reviewer's account history. (I am not saying this is what happened here, but the circumstances are certainly suspicious...) It's almost pointless to repost this now, since it's no longer on theater screens and my two cents aren't going to influence anyone not to shell out the $20 for a ticket. But here it is anyway. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is not worth one star. But it's not worth 9+ or whatever it currently has either. So in the spirit of Thanos and his pokemon gauntlet, let's balance out all the studio tools who gave this a 10/10 with undeserved but necessary one-star ratings. Realistically, it's like a 4-5/10. It's a dumb superhero epic with a ton of overpaid stars and over two dozen films leading up to this \"storyline\". It has the eye candy of hundreds of thousands of work hours worth of top-dollar CGI animation. It has spaceships, one-liners, explosions, magic jewels, and robot suits. It has very large characters with impressive rippling muscles, and the promise of a sequel that will put all the franchises back to normal so everyone can continue making money. What it doesn't have is a point of any sort, other than to just bludgeon you over and over again with \"entertainment value\". Which basically comes down to one big CGI battle after another, 'cause watching these human action figures trade one-liners is only entertaining if you know and care about the MCU and its vast horde of intellectual properties. On occasion, the dialogue exhibits a tiny bit of self-awareness of just how silly this whole enterprise is (like when someone said, \"you mean there's a Spiderman *and* an Antman?\"). That's nice. And for a brief moment here and there, it almost becomes the dark and grandiose space opera it actually wants to be - before quickly reverting to its tropey, Disney-fied comic book superhero franchise self. If your mind was somehow blown by this film, then you must have found Inception to be \"thought-provoking\". (Yes, that is meant to be derisive.) On the other hand, if you spent the entire 2.5 hours scoffing with bitter disappointment, you're not off the hook either: scoff at yourself for expecting anything other than what you actually got. Just shut up and be glad they didn't let Michael Bay or Zach Snyder anywhere near this.", "This movie is a masterpiece and if you haven't seen it you are missing out on so much", "Sorry, but it was. To me it seemed some evil villain surgically removed most of the characters' humour (they try, sometimes it works, but often it comes out just strained) and replaced it with pompousness and ostentatious sentimentality.\nThe story is pushed onwards with obvious effort, scenes pile up with an obvious primary intention to impress and move, gone is the joy, fun and ease of the first Avengers. It looked a little like Marvel was trying to give birth to a DC movie and the labour was hard indeed.", "Costing over $300 million to make, Marvel was setting up for the biggest cinematic experience they have ever created. They had a combined budget of over $1 billion making it one of the most expensive films ever made. As a Marvel fan, these numbers make it very exciting when preparing to watch their film, but with this particular film, $1 billion wasn't quite enough.\nThe Avengers, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spiderman (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and many more heroes from the Marvel Universe, unite to take down their most powerful enemy yet Thanos (Josh Brolin). Thanos is attempting to collect all six of the infinity stones in his plan to inflict his will on reality. The fate of existence itself has become uncertain as everything the Avengers have ever fought for leads to this battle.\nMarvel diehard or just an interested fan, everyone has a favorite superhero. When they first started the \"Avengers\" series there was an abundance of controversy surrounding the idea that pouring all those heroes into one movie would not be successful. Disregarding the hate, Marvel went straight for its intended film and created \"The Avengers\" in 2012. Grossing over $1.5 billion in earnings you could say they were right. With the pool of well loved heroes fighting side by side avengers decided to run with it, leading us to where we are now, The Avengers: Infinity War. The first problem with this film is it was clearly a shot to wring out as much cash as they could from the fan base they have created. With success of Ryan Coogler's \"The Black Panther\" and many other upcoming heroes the avengers turned into an overloaded group of heroes from all over the universe. People come to see the movies to see their favorite superhero in battle but with 500 other characters running around it draws the weight and storyline away from those specific character. It seems as if they just piled all the characters into one movie to please everyone for early box office sales.\nThe fact that everyone has their favorite hero, brings light to a problem with the storyline. In the film, Thanos has a goal of eliminating half of the population of the universe. Successfully obtaining the final infinity stone, with the snap of a finger, he eliminates half the population. In doing so he wipes out some pretty prominent heroes including Tom Holland's \"Spiderman\" Although Marvel did not fail to make Spiderman's final goodbye dramatic, it is still controversial. With the amazing success of the film \"Spiderman: Homecoming\" previously released, Tom Holland and the new Spiderman was gaining some steam. As a huge spiderman fan myself, it was extremely tough to see him go as it was for the millions of other fans. It is understandable to kill off a hero for dramatic purposes but why multiple characters that people come to view the movies for in the first place. Leaving Spiderman and other heroes out of the next movie could cause more people to be less exhilarated about the film.\nAnother problem Marvel seemed to have in their film was their weakness in capitalizing on climactic scenes. One scene that sticks out in particular and received plenty of backlash from the masses, was the battle on Titan. This battle was closest the Avengers came to defeating Thanos by taking the gauntlet and all six infinity stones off his hand. Iron man, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, and a variety of others finally knock Thanos out cold and attempt to pull the glove off his massive hand. Star Lord, a more comedic character, enters and brings his emotions to the table eventually slapping Thanos in the face and waking him up. The heroes were literally a fingernail away from saving the entire universe and succeeding in defeating Thanos. The whole entire movie led to that one intense scene and its disrupted by a more comedic character slapping Thanos in the face. Although the colors and CGI editing done on the planet Titan was impeccable, they failed to create the intended dramatic and tension filled scene of the team failing.\nAlthough the box office numbers say otherwise, Marvel didn't provide the film millions of their fans were looking for. The Avengers isn't what it once was and seems to be a way to make money off their ever growing fan base. With their billion dollar budgets you should expect amazing scenery and technology from the movie. They lack the production of the big dramatic scenes we long for and in doing so killed off heroes people come to see in the first place.", "Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people? A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a \"eat the rich\" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly. The deaths (\"deaths\") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works \"die.\" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me. This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.", "Well, here it is, what the MCU has been building towards, a showdown of epic proportions and a gathering of (most) of the numerous superheroes we've been subjected to mercilessly over recent years.\nSo the big question is, was it worth the wait? To put it bluntly, no, it wasn't. No doubt Marvel fanboys (and girls) will go crazy for 'Infinity War' and regardless of the quality of the film itself, it is going to be loved and lauded by the franchise's enthusiasts simply for the privilege to see all of their beloved characters together in one place.\nUnfortunately the enthusiasm of the fans does not seem to have reached the actors themselves, who now appear to have reached the point where they've realised that the film is going to be a commercial, and to a degree, critical success, no matter how well (or poorly) they perform. So, consequently, they don't really bother to put in much effort. And why should they? Their sizeable paychecks are already guaranteed just by showing up. So, just showing up is what they choose to do.\nAfter all, let's face it, unlike the devoted audiences that continue to spend their hard-earned cash to go and see these films, they're in it for the money, not for their love of the source material. The lead actors universally deliver not only the worst performances of their MCU careers, but in some cases (Mr. Downey Jr., I'm looking at you), arguably the worst performances of their entire cinematic careers. Content to just coast through proceedings without a shred of genuine emotion or charisma, they seem to be merely fulfilling the terms of their contracts, as opposed to what you'd call 'acting'. \nAnd these are not bad actors, by any stretch of the imagination, almost each and every member of the ensemble cast have proven they are capable of delivering outstanding performances (Chris Pratt and Tom Holland not included) in their other filmic endeavours. So it has to be said that their devoted followers deserve better. \n \nThe one shining light in all of this is, ironically, the film's chief villain (or hero, depending on your viewpoint, but I'm not going to get into that now), 'Thanos', portrayed brilliantly by Josh Brolin, who seems to be the only actor that's aware he is in fact in a very, very big film and not some frivolous dress rehearsal. Maybe, as a newcomer to the franchise, in his excitement to be a part of the biggest cinematic universe of all time, he was determined to deliver an outstanding performance worthy of the Marvel name, or maybe he's simply the only one who cares enough to try. Either way, it's extremely hard to find anything to criticise him about personally. Well done, Mr. Brolin. Now, the reason I've been so critical in my lambasting of the acting in this film, is because of how important is is to the outcome of the end product. This is supposed to be a genuinely emotional, moving cinematic experience, which if you can suspend disbelief enough, is not out of the realms of possibility. But when the characters appear to be completely indifferent to the events unfolding around them, it's very hard to empathise with them, much less care about what happens to them.\nWithout giving to much away, as many of you will know, it's in this film that we have to say goodbye (at least temporarily) to some of the saga's most beloved characters, I won't spoil anything by stating who these may be, but I will say that it's very unlikely that you're going shed a tear over, or indeed, give a damn about any one of them.  As for the plot, well obviously it's no 'Citizen Kane', but it's far from boring either, however the generic action sequences, though typically spectacular in their visual effects, can begin to border on tedious at times. I know i'm not alone when I saw enough is enough. This exercise in escapism has been enjoyable enough at times, but it has now run it's course. I'd love to believe that after the next instalment of the Avengers, this whole MCU fiasco can finally draw to a close, however, I've got a sneaky suspicion that the powers that be will still manage to drag this out for at least the next few years, if not the next decade. \nBut, as a passionate film fan, i'm now going to try to avoid these movies as best as i can and stick to more intelligent, adult-orientated and, for lack of a better word: 'real' cinema.\n4/10", "This movie is so boring I had to watch it in installments. Some folks say it blows your mind but I just think it blows. I probably over-rated it as a 4 but mostly because of the special effects. Weak plot, too much jumping around, WAY too long. Even the battle scenes drug on much too long. Thinning the herd may have been the best end solution for the movie. Too bad it didn't happen in the first 30-45 minutes. I was ready to dissolve into ashes by the time the credits were ready to roll. I think the people that loved this movie beyond compare are the same folks that would wait in line for 2-3 days for the release of the new iPhone.", "Avengers: Infinity War is the outcome of 3 decent films and 15 mediocre films. Avengers: Infinity Waris extraordinary overrated, all Marvel films (with the exception of a few.) are just dumb action films, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. So why is it that people are getting so emotionally invested in just another dumb action. The the quality of these movies range between anywhere of Ok, average to mediocre. And let me explain to you what is it that makes Avengers: Infinity War just an another mediocre. But I know to tell you this is just pointless because you're just going to dislike this review anyways.\n First I am going to address what people are praising the most about this film. So people are saying that this film is good because of how this was the first film that was able to take a lot of characters from other film and make it into a film. The reason why this is not a positive towards the movie is that all that you are really saying is this is good because it is a squall to a film that I liked. That's it. By saying that you are not judging this film as a price of art, but instead you are judging this film as an event. Which means nothing to me. This film should be able to stand on its own, If it can't then it is a bad movie. This being a squall is neither a positive nor a negative. You saying this is bacily telling Hollywood that if they have no ideas and just make squall avatar squall then the film will be automatically good. And again this is neither a positive nor a negative. The only reason why I an address this is because people are saying this is a positive. But I am not taking any points away from this film because of that.\n The acting in this film van rang from good to bad. There is a lot of actors in this film, But some felt miscated. The best example is Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange is a witty smartass just like every other character in this film. Benedict Cumberbatch is a dramatic actor and is not a good comedy. He has no experience in comedy. Look at his Filmography the only comedy role he has ever done was a highly scene in Zoolander 2 (which was triable) but everything else is dramas. \n But what about the commodity in this film will it is complete rubbish? I have never seen such a lazily written commodity in my life. There are two jokes in this film. First, there is the reference, the references in this film are lazy and dumb and here's a pierced example of how bad they are. In the first act of the film where Hulk was saying to Ironman that they needed to get the Avengers. Ironman says that the Avengers broke up, Hulk says \"They just broke up, like the Beatles.\" Now here is why this is a bad joke. All the joke is, is that it is simply acknowledging that The Beatles exist. it requires very little understanding of who and what The Beatles were, so fans of The Beatles will find nothing because there is no joke. It can barely be called the joke, now in comparison to another reference to the Beatles. In the TV show, family guy brian says \"This is more disappointing than Ringo's songwriting.\" That joke works not because they simply acknowledging that The Beatles existed, it workers because of how they take something that the Beatles had done and made it into a joke. Now even if you don't like this joke you have to acknowledge that it is a better-written joke than the one in Avengers because all Avengers does is acknowledge the Beatles without making any clever jokes on them. Now the second type of humor in this film is bathos. Now I already explained why this does not work in Marvel film in my Thor: Ragnarok review. But just for a breath some up, it takes the serious scenes and rounds them by adding an unnecessary joke that is painfully unfunny. The reason why bathos is such a terrible form of comity because it makes the tone of the film inconsistent. Their are series scenes in this film that have have joke thrown into then just for the sack of having a joke. Because of this the tone of the film is all over the place. Having a constant tone is an extremely important thing to have in a film, and it's not like it's a hard thing to do this is something not even the worst story writers would get wrong \nNow I am going to make a statement that might be considered controversial but, I think that the humor in the disaster Movie was better written and more intelligent. Now am not saying that Avengers: infinity war is inferior to the Disaster Movie. Unlike the disaster Movie, this film has good special effects/CGI some good acting and is at least continent at filmmaking. But when it comes down to the quality of humor disaster Movie is by far much better. The references in disaster Movie actually makes a joke out of what they are referencing making and rarely use bathos unlike Avengers: infinity war was that is 90% of all its humor.\n Something that I find completely shocking is how everyone has ignored these films cliches. Let me ask you, my humble readers, what is it that that character is fighting over. Well, MacGuffins of cors. But to give this film crit they did innovate this cliche by instead of having just one MacGuffin there are six MacGuffins. What those MacGuffin do exactly is never told but it just makes the big bad guy really strong so the heroes need to get them before the bad guy does. What an original plot point that we have never seen in a story ever before. And Gamora is kidnapped so there's a Damsel in Distress.\n The characters in this film are complete dom ass. They have three chances to kill Thanos but their stupidity screws they over every signal time. In the 3ed act of the film are about to take off Thanos's club but Star-Lord gets mad at Thanos and scrows the whole thing up. Then Thor throws his ax at Thanos's chest. Thano looks up to Thor and says \"You should of went for the heard\" So why THE HELL did he not go for the head. They are making the characters stupid so the main villain well live for the next movie. \n Why do people think that the characters that died in this actually die and it's not a fake out? Thanos brought back some random red guy back to life so he could take his stone. So they are obviously going to use this to bring back all those characters back to life. And simply just killing a characters does not make it into a good death scene.\n And the last problem of this film is that it is BORING!!! This film is two and a half hours long but it felt like two and a half years. The second act is unbearably boring I could barely go throw with the entire film.\n All and all Avengers: Infinity war is just a dumb action film, there's really nothing to get out of this besides some all right action BUT THAT IS IT!!! The comedy is extraordinarily bad and lazy, the plot predictable boring and cliched. I find it balling that such a predictable boring and cliched plot and be thought of as a masterpiece by so many.\nAnd that is why I give Avengers: Infinity War a 3 out of 10", "This is INSANE. This movie is fantastic. After 18 movies, the Directors/writers had to make a decision: Either write the movie for the critics: Making clear mini arcs for all the characters (which would've been stupid and impossible), plus a theme, plus \"time for the movie to rest, quiet moments\" blah blah blah. Or write the movie that the MCU deserved. Taking advantage of all the stories, baggage, and great characters the other movies already created and presented. Thank God the Russo brothers/Marvel decided correctly.", "Marvel again make hulk looks lame, and thanos pictured to be not really a villain at all, its different with the comic. his ideas is weak , they change it and not even mention the lady death at all.  the only interesting part is thor team, stark team is full of marvel stupid jokes, also the guardian being useless,  the ironman cgi suit is horrible , and thanos black order is a joke, marvel make them not scary at all. they put pop culture to make this movie more cringe!  also the final war looks stupid\nthey called wakanda the must advanced technology country, but there is no heavy weapon at all, only a shield and stupid pew pew spear omg so stupid! this movie is disaster.", "I expected more from it. Besides, wonder what comes next in the future of Marvel. I honestly almost fell asleep until Spiderman died. oof.", "Taken in the context of a larger narrative within the Marvel cinematic universe, Avengers: Infinity War impressively brings together the many beloved characters together for an action-packed adventure. However, the movie does not work on its own as a narrative, and like most Marvel movies it has particular cinematic flaws.\nFrom the first scene, it is clear that Infinity War relies heavily on CGI for both its characters and action sequences, which should not come to a surprise for Marvel fans. In fact, it is plausible to say that more than half the movie is touched by CGI, from epic space sets to flashy bursts of light denoting magical power. The CGI isn't done badly, but for anyone who isn't on completely board with that style of animation, Infinity War would be unwatchable. At times, the amount of mystical sparks, auras, and beams becomes so saturated that it is difficult to take the movie seriously. \nLuckily, Infinity War has some of the world's most beloved actors and characters in its arsenal, which have proven to be Marvel's greatest strength as a franchise. Having Robert Downey Jr. as Ironman, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and Chris Pratt as Starlord, just to name a few, give their characters credibility and charm. The writers do an excellent job balancing the many heroes, whose individual movies are often tonally different. Since the audience presumably has come to know and love each character from the standalone films and/or the Avengers, the actors are able to slip into their respective roles easily. This gives Infinity War a feeling of akin to huge family reunion, which definitely works in the movie's favor because the audience is emotionally invested.\nWhat makes the movie unique is that instead of following the traditional three act structure, the entire two hour and forty minute film acts as only as a chapter in a larger Avengers movie. Infinity War could be described as the latter half of a second act and the beginning of the third act. This means that the movie is almost entirely action with little exposition or character development. The lack of elaborate backstory or convoluted plot is refreshing in some ways, as some of the other Marvel movies suffer from over-complication. The action is well-choreographed and relatively creative, but because it fills the entire movie it can be mind-numbing. Anyone not familiar with Marvel or critical of the franchise will find nothing to connect to. Unfortunately, Infinity War lacks the political complexity and mysterious suspense presented in previous films. Shades of gray on moral dilemmas and conflicts between the heroes are downplayed or ignored in favor of a clear good vs. evil battle. \nInfinity War is a success within the world of Marvel, but not as a movie in its own right. Fortunately for Disney, Marvel is wildly popular among critics and fans alike, making it a financial and critical success. All of the advantages and disadvantages of a cinematic universe are shown in this movie, making it a unique cultural phenomenon.", "Marvel's biggest issue in my opinion is that there is just too much to take from comics, as it is a giant cluster mess. There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse. Good luck.", "I know my opinion will not be a popular one. I can not shake the feeling of being ripped off after watching this movie. 10 years of anxiously waiting, watching and loving movies only to be told sike, you gotta wait another year. the movie does have some positives.\n1. the cgi was great. Lets be honest, Netflix originals have great cgi. B movies have decent cgi now.\n2. Once the movie starts you don't want it to end. This also shows up on my negatives section.\n That pretty much sums up what I liked. Spoilers ahead, quit reading if you haven't seen the movie.\nNegatives.\n1. The humor never ends. I get it, the humor is funny, however, it does need to end at some point. When you have the big bad guy killing people and actively trying to kill you maybe its time to get serious.\n2. 5 minutes into the film you see heimdel and loki die. Yes I was saddened by this. Loki's death was particularly sad. Then almost 3 hours later you see Spider-Man, dr strange, black panther and many others die. This made the movie feel completely pointless. You also saw Thanos start to fade the same way as all the other deaths. His death is not on screen (movie ended, more about that later}. Some of the characters that died have confirmed sequels. I guess time travel will be a major part of the second part.\n3. Thanos death. Seriously? You go through all the trouble to collect the stones to kill 1/2 the universe and don't remove yourself from the equation. Yes some will argue he didn't die. It was obvious he was in the beginning phases of disappearing just like everybody else. Then the movie ended.\n4. The ending felt more like I was being told a story and the speaker just quit talking mid sentence. I did know it was part 1 of 2. I just hoped I would have a logical stopping point.\n5. The end credit scene. I used to love waiting around for these little snippits of what's to come or the simply goofy scenes. My favorite is the first avengers movie when all the heroes were eating schwarma. This 1 felt more like Disney and marvel were just trying to prove they can make us sit around for anything. Yes, this will make over $1 billion and yes the second will also. I also understand all the actors and Disney only do this because they want to make money. I would feel less betrayed if the title was \"Avengers: infinity war, the mouse wants your cash.\" At least they would have been honest.", "Avengers: Infinity War is a spectacle to behold to the general audience. To the avid Marvel Studios fan, however, it is the epitome of movie going. It spends next to no time explaining the close relationships some characters share, and instead, builds the most memorable villain since Heath Ledger's Joker. If you have watched all of the other Marvel movies up to this point, you will be delighted, debilitated, and craving more.", "First of all when I rate a film, I use this system for rating - 5 is a pass, 6-7 merit, 8+ distinction. I NEVER give a 10./10 because it's IMPOSSIBLE to make a perfect film. Thus my 8/10 would be 8.5 (distinction) if I could give half a star. Thus this film is VERY GOOD, but has a few issues. Because of the nature of the film, there are a LOT of characters, so inevitably some characters (2 in particular) is glossed over. Even Stan Lee's cameo was as brief as it could be (but considering his health that is understandable. This is the ULTIMATE crossover movie - virtually all marvel movie is represented in some way. To say this film is action packed is an understatement - if anything there is TOO much action - I could make a decent case this is 2 films rolled into 1 - hence the title of the review! Having said that, all action scenes were well done, and the issues re CGI I had against Black Panther weren't present here. As was shown in trailers, Thanos is on a quest to gather all the infinity stones to complete his plans for the universe. As such, Vision is a key target. We begin however in the cosmos with the Ragnarok survivors in a spot of bother. Loki shows his best & worst, and my appreciation for what Tom Hiddleston has done with this character is never higher than here. From here keeps flashing between earth & the cosmic realm - bringing into play the guardians. From here, it is standard MCU fair - if you've enjoyed any of the other movies, you will love this one. The big difference is Thanos - played fantastically by Cable - sorry Josh Brolin (nod to deadpoll ;-) ). and BOY has he done a fantastic job. All the claims that killmonger was the best villain in the MCU - are made to look VERY silly after watching Thanos. His plan is beyond diabolical, but the way he is played, it is quite possible to sympathise with him. Without saying WHAT he is trying to do, his motivations are to be benevolent! Whilst if he succeeded would be about as horrific as is possible, he doesn't do it to be evil destructive. In HIS mind, he is trying to prevent an even worse catastrophe! Yes the film plays it from Thanos's POV, and Thanos is taking a macro view of the universe! What is so great, is how Thanos is portrayed with a level of sympathy. It's as if Thanos doesn't WANT to do this, but he sees it a the only way to ultimately save the various species! I can see why people may not like this, there's things in here that I wouldn't have done. But for me, there is NO QUESTION this is an excellent film - but unlike many of the recent MCU films, no way could you consider this a romp! It's a complete tonal change from Ragnarok. And that is what I love about the whole MCU. They aren't afraid to change a working formula.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I've DELIBERATELY not discussed much, as this film needs to be seen - if nothing else Josh Brolin's performance. This DESERVES to make way much more money than Black Panther. When politics change, Black Panther will not date very will - Infinity War WILL in my view. the trailers fairly represent the movie. You like them, you WILL love this. Oh and Peter Dinklage shows why he is such a giant talent! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "After watching trailers promos u will be at peak stage of hype for this movie but after watching i found this movie as a over hyped movie with more expectations this film doesn't contain quality it is usual marvel movie which focuses on entertainment than an epic storytelling like dc", "I keep hearing about how complex and unique villain and how philosophical it is, so I decided to give it a chance. I'll be honest and note that as far as I'm concerned comic books are among the lowest forms of media, and the movies all feel more or less the same. I've always been a fan of second chances so I watched it with a friend and by the end it felt like we had seen two different movies. It was just another generic superhero ensemble movie with extra pretentiousness and angst, thanos was just a madman who convinced himself he was rational. It just further shows that being a nerd doesn't automatically mean you're smart, I can't wait until Hollywood gets past it's nerd phase...", "Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod..........\nThere is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust.  The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.' Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc.\nDefinitely a film for those who follow Marvel Comics - or those who need an escape form the chaotic world we inhabit. 'That's entertainment?'.", "This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free ***** (5/5) IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock.  Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test.  Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron \"I'll do it myself\" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin.  How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage.  Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them? Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait.  VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.", "No, I'm not the type of Marvel fans who appreciated blindly every movie they made. Believe me, you are not ready for this one. And if you saw it, you weren't prepared. What a movie ! I never thought they could erase the mistakes they made with Civil War but they do and the picture is what we want but nothing you can expect. Congrats Marvel Studios. 10 Years in the making has another meaning : excellence.", "There is so much wrong with this movie! Thanos is not a Titan (an elder, more powerful god), he is just from a planet called Titan (not Saturn's moon). So why is he so powerful? He was not even important on his home world.\nAnd his \"solution\" is ridiculous! It is like he is unaware of simple economics or basic biology. Killing 1/10 of all creatures?! Does he not know that they reproduce?! \nOverall, just a movie with lots of action, and a nonsensical plot.", "Not in its entirety this movie is bad, the truth that the end is the bad part, in my opinion is more similar to a series, with the difference that we have to wait up to 2 years for the next chapter", "WHAT WAS THE PURPOUSE OF FIGHTING IF THE VILLIAN WAS GONNA WIN SPIDER MAN WHY DID U DIEE:((((", "Well, it is we the people who finance such utter trash by buying tickets so we might as well claim our part in promoting this stupidity! I had bought this as part of a friend's night out at the movies but we found the movie so predictable that we stepped out in the break!! Avoid!!!", "I love the original Avengers movie, mostly down-to-earth people with a few special butt-kicking skills - I have never been a fan of the Star Trek style other-world alien thing, green people and talking animals just bore me. This movie is mostly not set on Earth, so it lost my interest quite quickly. And then the ending... Marvel, I've never been so mad at a movie. So so so disappointed with what you just did there. I actually wanted my money back.", "The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story.  'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe. 'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course! But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc. That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure! Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch!  Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts. On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.", "I took four 12yr olds & one 8yr old and it was universally panned for the bad ending. It is also irritating (after all of that screen time) to be held hostage to a short scene after a long, I mean long, credit role. I first thought the audience was in stunned disappointment but figured out by the hanging around something else was happening as well. Last scene should have started 45 seconds into the credits.", "This movie was GARBAGE from the beginning till the end. Too much super heroes. Too much CGI. Zero plot. Everybody sucked in this mess. The Hulk just got on my nerves and i love the guy. Avoid this if you can. It\u00b4s just an empty shell. Awful movie.Pure GARBAGE.", "This movie is simply disappointing and the ending even more", "So obviously based on my title I didn't like this film. There are so many holes that it would be impossible to even count them.\nI'm so tired of CGI bad guys, I know we have the makeup skills to actually have \"real\" bad guys that don't look so fake. Seeing this cartoon the whole movie just really separated me from the \"reality\" that the movie makers were trying to present.\nRandomly killing half the people in the universe? This was the best you could think of? What about in a few years when the remaining half over populate again? Is that going to be your job from now on? Mr. Genocide? \"Yes, every 100 years I wipe out half of the population.\" Who wrote this? A 10 year old?\nHow about sterilizing 75 to 80% of the universe?\nAlso what about the Thanos character say's \"I care about all life in the universe?\" You do? Why? Your planet has already been destroyed so why do you give a crud about everyone else? Bad guy with a heart?\nAlso, if you're going to make this a two part film don't hide it. There was no reason to hide the fact that this one movie is not the end. I know the directors and writers think they're cute \"Tee Hee\" but you're not fooling anyone.", "This was the movie we were expecting for a long long time and while Thanos is the best Marvel villain i got a feeling the movie was a little crowded with all the main characters. Sure, they do need to include everyone but on the other hand we never see them all together and the movies gives a vibe of being rushed around from one place to the other and you constantly need to be focused on what is going on. I love all the characters and actors are amazing performers and the story has got to be dark i do think it was a bit too dark since it does not have one positive moment and the Avengers team gets defeated on and on. Of course there is a sequel coming out but i do think a few positive moments would have been good. I loved all the performances and cgi is amazing so overall a positive experience.", "\"Infinity War\" set out to achieve what no other film has dared to do so far. While the effort was clearly visible, it unfortunately fell short. -Analysis of Notable Work-\n*Writing/Story: This film has quite a chore to complete by keeping an eye on so many characters. I admire the drive to tell a complex story, but there was a lack of depth and meaning in the storytelling. Despite the possibility of the world coming to an end, there did not seem to be any sense of urgency. The narrative told us there was urgency, but we did not feel it. Most characters were visited for a brief moment, but there was no real connection. We also did not have any need to fear Thanos. These are catastrophic mistakes when creating such a massive film.\n*Directing: The ambition the Russo brothers had for this film is second to none, but their execution was disappointing. This film is simply too big to handle, especially when ideas are springing from two minds.\n*Cinematography: This was one of the most disappointing aspects of the film. Trent Opaloch does not seem to put any meaning behind his camera work and lighting choices. Everything looks rather bland, and at times it is easy to tell that scenes were shot in a green screen sound stage. Many of the action sequences are so shaky that there is no possible way to tell who is hitting who. The rest of the film is shot with such uninspired obligation. It feels as if each scene was framed in such a way that the only purpose was to get the actors faces/bodies on screen so that we can fully see their conversations. There is no visual storytelling beyond that; no visual cues or powerful images. The art of cinematography is not an art form in this film. Marvel again seems to make the mistake that bright colors equals good cinematography. In reality, the color palette is a mess because there is a mash of vibrant colors that serve no purpose.\n*Music/Sound Design: The music makes a small improvement from the previous films. There are a few powerful musical moments, but they are drowned out by the generic Avengers theme that is terribly overused. The sound design is one of the strengths of the film. We feel the crushing blows of fists landing hits and buildings being crushed. Unfortunately, we also have many typical sound effects that appear in too many action films. It would have been nice if Marvel designed a few of their own sounds and took more ownership of their Universe.\n*Acting: The acting is nothing special. Other than a few weak performances, most of the actors do their jobs to keep the story running without drawing too much attention to themselves. We never get enveloped in any scene, but we are not completely taken out of one, either.\n*Production Design/Special Effects: Like most Marvel films, the costume and set pieces tend to be pretty generic. There is nothing fancy about them. Sometimes they don't put in enough effort and it looks plastic or like it is part of a high school play, yet other times they try too hard and it ends up looking like a live-action version of fan art. Spider-Man and Iron Man look especially ridiculous in this outing. As far as location and sets go, once again, the big battle takes place in an open area with nothing visually interesting about it (much like the airport in \"Civil War\"). In regards to special effects and visual effects, the CGI is usually above average in Marvel films. However, it was completely overused in this film. Many of the characters were completely CGI when they should have been real actors in make-up. Marvel's reliance on CGI was definitely too heavy in this film. During battles, there were far too many laser-looking things flying around that it became distracting. Emphasizing many more practical effects would have done this film a lot of good.\n*Conclusion: \"Infinity War\" fails to live up to the incredible promises it made, and ends up being more of a massive fight scene with generic dialogue scenes in between rather than being a compelling story with a climactic battle that serves purpose. It entertains, but delivers no real impact.", "Aw yeah it's pretty good. 10/10. Come on, it's an avengers movie. What more can I say?", "The movie had some good character moments but aside from Thanos' story arc, which was interesting, the movie was a convoluted mess. And not even all of the action kept me from yawning. Dr. Strange had some great action scenes but for the most part the choreography in this film was nonexistent and sloppy. And If people thought the humor in the Last Jedi was out of place then you will really be disappointed here. Unlike Thor Ragnorok, the humor in Infinity War was for the most part; not funny and it came up at wrong moments in the film, which removed the seriousness in certain situations.  Even the acting seemed lazy, especially the performances of Ruffalo and Evans. These guys are running out of steam and put no energy into the roles this time. Even Robert Downey and Tom Holland lacked the chemistry they have often displayed in previous films. Perhaps its not their fault but the due to the fact that they had so little screen time. This film might as well be a Guardians of the Galaxy film, but they called it an Avengers film because they have more prestige. The film should have been called Infinity War and that's that.  To sum it up, this film is a 2.5 hour long first act of a three-act film. Save your money because you will be disappointed, just like my entire theater was.", "Could not sit through the movie. What a waste of time.", "The reason i was dumb founded with this movie was probably because i havnt seen the gaurdians of the galaxy movies , doctor strange, black panther or captain america civil war, its hard to keep track of this marvel universe , but either way this film was overblown with CGI and in my opinion this wasnt a patch on the first movie avengers assemble, the inclusion of certain characters made the film interesting to watch but overall i would say it was dissapointing with a bad ending.", "I like this type of movie but would have liked it a lot more if I didn't have to keep turning the volume up and down because the music is louder the talking. Maybe it works in a theater but for watching it at home volume could be balanced out considerably more. I'm writing this as I watch it. I've gotten to the point where they arrived at Nidavellir and I thats where I had to stop watching.", "My apologies to all the fans but in my old man opinion this was not the movie that the hype led me to believe. Yes the \"effects\" were amazing and most of the jokes funny but other than that it seemed so predictable as to be boring. Again this is just the opinion of a grandpas that heard his grandsons talking about how amazing and at the same time sad this movie was. I believe that for someone to truly enjoy this epic, they would have to invested a large amount of time learning and watching this genre would have gotten much more out of this movie. As just entertainment it did not do the job for me. My sincere apologies again to all the fan boys and girls, this show just did not hit the spot.", "Why when Thanos get all stone Thor all most kill him and why is it that only the new superhero turn to ash. Well I'll assume there is a part 2", "Just another average blockbuster. They're throwing in too many gimmicks and too many lame jokes.  Many superheroes dying is just one of the gimmicks. Look at the ones dying. They're all not part of the first avengers movie. Spiderman? We know they've planned a sequel. Black Panther? Sequel is planned. Doctor Strange? Sequel is planned. MCU is going to come up with some or the other reason to resurrect all these heroes. They should have killed some of the original heroes if they had the guts.  Coming to the plot. What plot? It's just Thanos trying to get all those stones. But at the same time, Thanos was one strong character. The only one whom we would remember after the movie. Also, the CGI was great. Fights were just ok. Other gimmicks include Thor getting a new Hammer. Or was it an axe? I don't know. Then Iron Man with a new suit which is just bland and nothing actually new.  And, what happened to Hawkeye? They weren't able to get Jeremy Renner for the shooting? Wait for a decent print to come in the internet, download it, have a beer or two and watch it with someone for all the goofiness. Don't waste your time going to the theatre.", "Half of this movie is really great, the other half is great fan service, but ultimately shouldn't have been in the movie. This is mostly a movie about Thanos. It is also a movie about Thor, Dr Strange, Ironman, Spiderman and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Then there are so many more characters in it that just steal screen time and drags the movie on and on, well past its expiration date. I know that not having those characters show up would have also been cause for concern, but adding them in this way really brings this movie down from possible greatness to mediocrity. There are also a lot of other issues with this movie regarding the fluctuating power levels, the painfully bad spirit stone sacrifice monologue, the accomplishment of killing more protagonists than almost any other movie and doing so without either me or any of their own friends really caring, etc. The biggest sin though is working up a world for ten years and ending up giving us a terrible X McGuffins coming together plot, and a villain that has an interesting idea about the world and the laziest worst, least thought through plan of enacting his vision. There are so many flaws with his half-population-solution I don't even know where to begin. It is so bad it isn't even villain of the week material on Netflix or the CW. Light hearted comedy is what Marvel does well. This movie has too much of everything they do poorly. I was really entertained half of the time. It's not enough.", "People are saying \"wow best marvel movie yet\" I say wow worst marvel movie yet\" the plot was everywhere, it was way to long and nothing really happened the whole time. It was a complete waste of time. The romance and comedy were the best parts of the movie. The action was pretty good, but there was way to much backstory and no actual long intense battles. Some characters that looked like they were going to a big part in the movie were in it for like 2min. Overall it was a big let down because I had been waiting forever for this movie to come out and I was actually exited. My advice, save your money and wait until the infinity war 2 comes out. I swear you won't miss anything important.", "It does not matter how much of a fan you are, this movie is generic, lowest denominator entertainment. It's fine, but does not deserve its current rating of 9.1. Are you guys kidding? This is as good as The Godfather or Shawshank? Please. I'm sure it'll drop to a more appropriate rating when the hype dies down.", "A purple bad guy with a power glove. 2 billion dollars? Really?", "Absolutely Amazing. Lives for the hype. I was surprised to see how serious this movie is compared to other MCU movies. If you're going to see this movie expecting those classics gags and one liners from the other movies this is not it. This movies has complex and emotional carachter arcs and it all comes down in such a perfect tone. 10 years lead up to this. Definitely worth the wait. The only downpoint is that it lacks the cosmic ingredients from the cosmic (if you read the story you know what I mean)", "Hey everyone (Spider-Man voice), I'm going to keep this review short and snappy and I won't dive into plot details (as requested by the Russo Brothers). #Thanosdemandsyoursilence \nI went into this movie with the mindset that I will be blown away and this will not only be a home run but out of the park. All I can say that my expectations were met. \nThanos is the most powerful villain we've seen to date and the avengers, who are torn apart (following Civil War) are not prepared for this. And then insanity ensues accompanied with real stakes and potential dire consequences. It's a great story filled with twists and surprises. \nI enjoyed it a lot and I think so will everyone as I predict this will beat the opening weekend record (set by force awakens) and cross the $250 million line. A review will be uploaded to my YouTube channel (OddinaryProductions) very soon and I will answer any questions you have regarding the movie. Thank you for your time :)", "I say this a lot but, DON'T LISTEN TO THE HYPE!! This movie is the worst to date!! They didn't stick to the comics hardly at all,( I'm not an Avengers comic fan)!! Prime example of not sticking to the source material, the fight with the bad guy where they try to take the glove off his hand & having Starlord being a complete a..hole IS NOT IN THE COMIC!! What Disney did, & they do this better than any, is take a beloved character from Gardians & turn him into someone you can't stand!! That's a small example of how they messed up!! I've been saying this for a long time now but I will still say it until they finally do it, GIVE THE COMIC MOVIES A LONG LONG BREAK!!! We don't need to see two or three every year!!", "There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there. There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain).  The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone. Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and \"die\" (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today.  My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life. Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.", "Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody. Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment. Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable.  But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.", "Here we go, Marvels never fail me! another 10!, The story line is very good, all Major characters are all highlighted which is very important. CGI is very good as well... I love it. Now, I can't wait for the next sequel 2019.. Hoping to see a new member!", "100 minutes of a glorified Guardians of the Galaxy movie followed by a too long battle scene by which i'd checked out. The ending bits were unsatisfying with an ending that just left you with no resolution. Basically 150 minutes of your life where nothing happens or is resolved.", "I was excited when i have seen fake 8.6 IMDB score of a movie.  so i sat down and started watching.  i was surprised how good was the graphics , but this thig that they call \"MOVIE\" is filming a green screen. you don't call filming a green screen a movie. \nthis film had nothing to offer other than green screen effects. \nfor 12 year old kids - this movie will be good.  God oh god how i was surprised when this 90% of green screen filming thing was rated above movies like \"Interstellar\" or \"saving private Ryan\"  what is wrong with this world?", "This film seems like aggregation of Marvel movie experience. It has large budget, cool effects, nice costumes, good actors, funny humor. Still same as other Marvel creatures, it's completely empty regarding it's script. No logical decisions from characters, most of the time it feels like they are completely stupid. Each 3-4 min I facepalmed after some scene. It was pretty painful to watch it. Is it so hard to spend more money on story and kick ass of those, who create stupid episodes?", "Why even bother having actors in these films by this point? Funny Disney can spend hundreds of millions of dollars when their only set is a big room with green walls. Kudos to the seven hundred and fifty nine thousand animators on this film. Good work.", "The worst mcu movie I've ever seen. I really wanted to like it since it was so critically acclaimed and praised, but I think this movie is overwhelmingly overrated. I won't watch it again like I did after I watched the first avengers movie.", "For me, the worst Avengers to date. What's this movie? The first of many to come in a series? I do not know. It's by far the weakest scenarios of all the Avengers series. I gave it a 3/10 for those reasons. Very dissapointed and bad movie.", "Teenagers will enjoy this film.\nDecision-making of characters makes no sence at all.\nThere is nothing in this film except special effects, bad jokes and bought reviews.", "Though not as bad as Black Panther, still lately the quality of all Marvel Films is rather poor and only geared to making a quick buck. Please Less Quantity but More Quality. Let's hope DC is not going in the same direction.", "The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy combine forces to battle Thanos (Josh Brolin). It seems he has a glove that needs five stones to give him power to control the galaxy. He has three on the and will do ANYTHING to get the last two. It's too long and has no ending but I still loved it! The CGI Is flawless, the action scenes are fast and furious and the story whizzes along. The movie does assume you've seen every Marvel comic book film to get the characters so be warned. The acting is great and the movie manages to juggle multiple characters and plots and still make sense. Can't wait for part 2! :)", "This movie sucked bad just like all Marvel it's a same thing over and over there was a couple good Marvel movies", "As a cinephile since I'm a little little kid, and being 28 y.o. now, I have to say this is THE BEST FILM ever made, to the date, EVERYTHING IS PERFECTION, the script, the production, the cinematography, the jokes, the acting, the characters, the construction of every aspect and hue of the plot, the music, a perfect example of that human beings even we have differences, we are all in the same side, and we have to let those differences aside and join to defend what is right, no matter what, it's an example of courage, human values, sacrifice for others, IT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE to teach and educate kids, about how important is the respect to each other, MAGNIFICENT! it leaves you a message, a beautiful and powerful message, unlike the over-hyped GODFATHER, that doesn't leaves you anything except a bad taste about deaths and crime, no teaching, nothing.Avengers: Infinity War It's like the perfect movie I've been expecting all my life without even knowing it, 10 OUT OF 10, MASTERPIECE.Period.", "The movie has a fair share of funny and great moments, however there were plenty of scenes that were plain stupid. The writing was fine. The acting was generally just ok, nothing special. the action scenes and cg were also decent but it was nothing really new or stylistic. I also found the plot and some of the motivations/ decisions made by characters to be stupid, but that's just a personal thing. Overall it was just a mix of good and bad, but with the bad slightly outweighing the good. therefore making it just below average for me. If I could, i would rate it a 4.5/10. Also I feel like i should add, despite me not really enjoying the film, i can see why others did. This movie and if you enjoy it really comes down to the person watching it.", "Let's start with the Zero of the movie; Thanos, AKA, Bane-with-no-brain, AKA, the son of Brutus from the Popeye cartoons. This guy's dream is to kill half of all the sentient beings in the Universe so there are enough resources to go around for everyone left; so he's basically the Joker on stupid pills. First of all, that idea is copied from a more intelligent version of a similar concept from \"Watchmen.\" Second, are we really supposed to believe that Thanos is so dumb that he does not notice when populations of living things are cut back, that they grow back stronger, thicker and more robust? So what is he going to do; wipe out half the universe every 100 years as populations grow back? The stupidity of this concept is staggering. But it's really nothing compared to the banality of the character itself. Thanos is a guy who shows up magically in every scene with the same smug grin on his face then struts around goes; \"Ha Ha Ha, I'm too strong for you, weaklings, look at my giant arms and manly rock-like chin.\" He's like the villain of some 1950's cartoon and he is more one-dimensional than Paper Mario. But it gets better, he is invincible, seems to know everything, and has some way to get around every superhero's powers. He's like a character written by a little kid; completely infallible and totally, unbelievably boring.  And then there are the \"Infinity Stones.\" So these totally unexplainably super-mega powerful stones have been floating around pawn shops across the universe for billions of years and no one ever thought to get them all together before Thanos? Wow, I guess he is a genius. Seems like the history of that universe would really just be a long line of big-chin jerks like Thanos who got all the stones together and used the godlike power to bully everyone else around. Of course Thanos is the first person to ever think of building giant Michael Jackson style glove for one hand to be able to hold all the stones. I guess that's what makes him such a revolution. These stones could have been developed into something meaningful, but this movie basically wastes them as the 'stamp collection of the Gods.\" Fortunately there are also Superheros. Well, not really. Essentially none of them have any relevant powers or cleverness in this movie and they never do anything that makes any difference. In fact, they are pretty much interchangeable. Mostly they just all fight the henchmen of Thanos, who are inexplicably unbeatable and even more boring and bland than Thanos. The most unforgivable misuse of a character is Rocket, who barely has any lines and almost none of them are remotely funny.  Lastly, there is the blah ending that is so unbelievably ridiculous that they are going to have to spend the next 6 movies dancing around it like the X-Men series had to do with \"Last Stand.\" Actually, it's not really an ending at all, the movie just completely gives up on making any sense and in the last 15 minutes gives away all credibility. The final scenes are like an epiphany of disappointment, where you realize that the whole movie has just been leading up to the realization that the folks who made this are just incompetent and have no business making movies. Another perfect example of a franchise created by someone with vision being turned over to a crew of accountants. I would say this movie is a complete dog, but I like dogs.", "The visuals were great, the music was great and there was some good humour.\nI like a lot of the previous marvel films. In this movie, I was confused in almost every scene. I felt that the characters' capabilities seemed different from what I saw in earlier movies and, a lot of the time, their actions/choices were bizarre and unfounded. I was often thinking \"Why did...?\" \"and How on earth did...?\" \"Whaaat?\"\nHaving so much of this confusion in the fast-paced, action-packed movie ruined it for me :( I wish it happened otherwise...", "Disappointed that thanos randomly chose for the original avenger movie team to bring back the rest of MCU to life. Liked the movie but expected something epic with thanos. This is getting too repetetive just the second and third part of civil war were they are gonna get back together and beat a bigger guy.", "I HATE CONTINUING MOVIES! And it takes 2 yrs after we pay $25 at the theatre SERIOUSLY! , SUCKS", "I'm not sure why all the 10 star ratings??\nWas I watching the same movie?\nToo much going on during last act, it was too much, lost interest, \nI did not want to see puny Banner in the Hulk Buster, how bout the Hulk! So disappointed!\nWatched the first Avengers again before going to see this, was sooo much better\nBooooo", "Was very very disappointed with this movie. It just did not have anything going for it. I mean there were moments that were good. But you cant just rely on a couple of big moments to carry the entire movie. There wasnt a story. There were constant loopholes (like Thor's varying powers. He cant fight Thanos but a dying star light gives him nothing but a sun tan). Most importantly the humour was not working at all. This after thor ragnarok which just was awesome in ghat department. Overall i would say i was as disappointed with this movie as with BvS. I guess i wont be watching Avengers 4 as well.  P.S. The critics reviews of Avengers infinity war make me skeptical. They may not be paid reviews, but i guess they are scared of giving a bad review to such a huge movie.", "Yes, history repeats itself. The black panther phenomenon is back, now renamed as infinity war. An avengers' film didn't need all that false hype to reach 600 million, I supposed. The boldest superhero movie ever that could kill off any of its heroes just for the sake of making a masterpiece? Well, we are not so lucky, superheroes are for children because they don't die. They return, as multi million dollar potential still remains. So what's the point of fooling with incorrect ideas posted smartly to make one think otherwise. The secret lies with kids. No matter how mature or philosophical they pretend to be, a belief still remains that these works need grown up kids or real ones to break records. It's this idea that this film strengthens, putting Christopher Nolan's hard work to dust.\n And yet all this hype has found takers. In the world of today, humans too can be programmed (skynet beware). It happens so that mass hysteria gives way to a prolonged hypnosis that hinders the truth from coming out. There were times when bad films finally got what they deserved. But now it seems humans have gradually transformed into bots. A majority view is now a bot's view, programmed to perfection. \n The movie industry is now devoid of its stories, superheroes don't die, but stories do. What's left is a mishmash of all the same. Now about the movie: weak plot, weak execution, with bits of unwanted comedy and no change. The future will be more of the same.", "In the avenger series, this one is my favourite movie..", "This movie Was Excellent Great Work I Was watched 16 Times\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude4f", "Is it possible to put a lot of superheroes together in one movie? Avengers Infinity Wars attempts that, and succeeds in spectacular fashion! All the Marvel movies before this were building up to this epic movie, and you are a fan of the Marvel movies and have been watching them, you will feel really good watching this, as a lot of favourite characters from previous Marvel movies appear here.", "If you don't like the movie, it's not for you. The final chapter is for someone who has read the story", "For some reason, the Oscar voters will never vote for a CGI actor because \"it's computer generated'\". That's BS. The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is.\nJosh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.\nOscars, make a new category for CGI actors!", "Thanos a well written villain however he can be slightly boring, props\nTo Josh Brolin.

This movie is amazing and it is not like the other super-hero movies. It is different with its story at most. I don't think making a different movie is a good thing. This is not the reason why the movie is good. We waited for a good villain for a real long time. Okey The Avengers was just the beginning and that movie was real good. Ultron can be much better villain but it didn't. The story of first and second Avengers movie was not so good. Second was even worse than the first one. We needed for a good villain for a long time as I sad. And finally we have seen that villain in this movie. They're in the Endgame now.", "I might have watched it more than five times now. It is just great ....everything in it....story telling acting specially the conclusion (and many movies have failed there)...\nOverall maybe one of cinema best product in superhero movies", "This movie has hit all points at the highest level. It was hilarious at some points while still being heartwrenching at others. It portrayed all of the MCU characters very well and gave all of them major rolls in the story while not overpowering any one of them. This movie took major risks and I believe that Marvel executed it to perfection. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is filled with heart, humor, and sacrifice that help redefine what a hero should be. The Russo brothers have crafted an epic of galactic proportions that will have fans contemplating long after the credits roll.", "As a lifelong fan of the comics and a fan of the movies since Iron Man, I loved this film. It will lose you if you have not been paying attention up until this point and it has obviously polarised audiences, but it is a masterpiece of directing and scriptwriting. I can't wait to see where we go from here. If you've enjoyed marvel thus far, you'll find a lot to like. It is a marked improvement on the story from the old comic! I suspect people score movies low to bring the average down and yet Infinity War still currently stands at 8.9/10! That alone should tell you all you need to know about the quality of this movie. It won't be for everyone, but no movie is! For me, it was perfect. Exciting, moving and thoroughly enjoyable. A triumph.", "My rating is weak 8/10 but I almost gave it 1 because it is so overrated and sooo overhyped.\nI think the movie is very enjoyable and very funny at sometimes but it has problems and its not perfect. I really dont like what they did with the Captain America. He was there just to show off with his beard. And I like that the Thor is most powerful but I dont like that he didnt use powers untill he got stormbreaker. Star-Lord is in my top 10 heroes and they just ruined him in this movie. Movie has some plot holes that im not gonna mention. And all deaths after the snap felt forced. Fanboys are saying it is best superhero movie ever. I mean, its not even best mcu film I think Civil War, GOTG and Iron Man are better movies. Overall as I said very enjoyable and funny but I still dont think it deserves 8.5...", "It's an alright movie but in my opinion it's not the best MCU movie tho", "Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous. Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging. The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on. Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised. Perhaps a second viewing is needed down the line.", "Early in the movie I was completely annoyed with the Guardians of the Galaxy. The seriousness of the universe was overshadowed by petty comic arguments between the team. I understand it was intentional but it was annoying. But then later Quill, Guardian of the Galaxy, was responsible for the death of half the life in the universe because he gets in a tamper tantrum with Thanos over the death of Gamora. Come on. Why wasn't he cracking up jokes instead? The Avengers team didn't turn on him? Really? Then the powers of the superheroes are inconsistent. Vision, the all powerful creation with the stone in him gets tossed around like a toy by Thanos' minions. One moment they can take on Thanos and in other scenes they're wimps. Bruce Banner wears the Iron Man suit, which he battled and lost against as the Hulk. But the suit gets shredded like paper by Thanos' army. There's also the suits Tony Stark upgraded from himself and Spider-Man. One moment the suits are there and the next they're literally turned off. It's as if Tony Stark can create matter from nothing. At least make it believable like the early Iron Man series. Overall this movie takes things way too far. It was way too cartoonist.", "It's unbelievable just how many different films and characters this movie can cram in. Some funny moments but ended up turning the movie off before it ended. The Avengers started off well but this film is just too much and far too many crossovers. It's ruined the franchise for me", "Applaud these movie makers; with so many characters with huge roles, the pressure of making a good movie is high. This isn't just an amazing superhero movie, it is an amazing movie. Go in with little to no expectations, just like any movie. Thanos' motive is extreme, but you can see where he is coming from (don't worry I don't agree lol). The storyline is classic: evil villain has a motive and the god guys try to stop him. This movie doesn't just stop there, there are twists, turns and unexpected instense emotional situations that keep you guessing. When the whole movie is explained at the beginning, and the ending you were expecting happens, you might be disappointed. Here, the movie mysteriously ends in a fashion open for interpretation. The twist at the end is something you might expect, but the manner in which it is executed leaves you speechless. The remaining persons after Thanos' stint on earth are left with questions regarding what happened to their friends. Some die, some live, but the real question is what actually happens to those \"turned to dust\". Allow me to explain my interpretation. When Thanos uses his guanlet, some part of the person or item is usually colored similar to the infinity stone used (purple fire emerges when he uses the power (purple) stone). When he uses his gauntlet to destroy a moon and literally pull the remains towards Iron Man, his gauntlet turns blue and purple. However, when Thanos uses his gauntlet to execute his master plan (once he has all of the infinity stones), there are no colors, either on his gauntlet or on or near anyone affected. These people literally \"turn to dust\" and fade into the wind. But are they dead? I am under the impression that they are transported to some sort of spiritual prison or something like that under the supervision of Thanos. Also, since Thanos has the time stone, the people who \"turn to dust\" likely can be brought back. Overall, it is more than just a superhero movie, it is a great movie. The previous movies help for background purposes and allow the movie to illustrate the current issues. The acting is incredible and the characters are fun with watch. The story is incredible and the ending is open for interpretation, but not too much so that you are confused to the point of frustration. The Prestige made me want to watch the whole movie over again the second it ended, but Avengers: Infinity War made me want to watch the next Avengers just the same. Just don't be mad at StarLord.", "This is a great movie. Entertaining to the max with absolutely stunning action scenes. Amazing emotional ending that leaves you breathless.", "It was the best Marvel movie. It was nice that Marvel Studios decided to bring all the superheroes introduced yet to face the biggest and baddest villian, Thanks. Great action and a great story. The ending was the best one leaving all the viewers in alot of suspense.", "I was wondering who a sequel like this reaches a IMDB score of 8,6.\nStarting the film I had great expectations!\nBut I really found NOTHING in this movie that is worth more than 4 stars.\nThis is a senseless digital action trash with no story at all!\nIt\u00b4s just a bunch of knows characters fighting the almighty bad guy ...\nNo new Ideas, not funny, not emotional, just explosions and fist fights with some magic artefact lacking any sense. \nAnd the end of it is just -to be continued-. Even that tiny bit of story is not even told to the end.\nIts a shame that this move stands among great films with a rating of over 8.\nIf you watch it please rate it properly and send it down to where it belongs!", "It's okay. Basically Thanos is unbeatable. He spends the movie getting the Infinity stones and, when he has them, is even more unbeatable. He sacrifices the adopted daughter that he didn't like anyway and who tried to kill him. Wow. And, er, that's it. So because IMDB insist, I have to write more. Trouble is, there's little else to say about the movie. It, erm, contains lots of fighting and an unbeatable Thanos who sacrifices a daughter who he didn't like anyway and who tried to kill him. And so on and so on. Meh. Looking forward to Captain Marvel.", "Inflationary overload of superpower special-effects when suddenly ECERYBODY in the whole film is a superhero and there are no normal people left..!  There are also too many characters featured, giving each only a short stage appearance, so beyond a handful of witty jokes no real character development is possible and most actors become superficial support roles with no real function in the plot - just one more superhero crammed in there who's also there.  On top, the characters are almost all excessively powerful, way more than in past movies, so every scene becomes bigger and louder... and after a while just a boring sequence of mindless excesses - unrealistic even in the superhero world's setting, making it dull.  The only surprise to an otherwise bland film is the shock ending where the bad guy wins and kills half the universe and half of the superhero cast. (you almost feel grateful to him for cutting the inflated number of superheroes i half!) On a positive note, the special effects are great including Thanos' animation and expressive facial features. \nAll-in, alas, not a film worth watching.", "If lazer tag with hack writers sounds like your idea of a nice Friday evening then good for you.

It is about this all powerful villian called thanos who was just too invincible, frankly this guy's seems like he was God Almighty.

Although it was the infinity stones which make him that powerful nevertheless from the begin it was all too easy for this guy. Finally, it was a great propaganda.", "The russo brothers did a good job on managing a huge number of charecters,movie was entertaining as hell ..what they did with thanos was great but i would have love to see thanos a bit more horrific by nature and looks(the purple guy from age of ultron credit scene) with that intense character ,after all he is thanos!!anyone except ebony maw from the black order didn't looked promising.\nThe ending was tragic but still amazing ...overall it was a great movie to watch speacially at big screen.", "This movie is perhaps the most anticipated movie of the year, maybe even of all time. So naturally, I went in the theater with really high expectations. With that, comes the fear that the movie won't live up to its hype. However, Infinity War manages to keep me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. With recent Marvel installments being rather stale, the addition of the Russo brothers really took Marvel in the right direction. For the first time, you can really feel the struggles and despair from our favorite heroes. The overall theme and tone are more mature than ever before. Great move from Marvel to keep audiences engaged. Infinity War is, in my opinion, the best marvel movie up to date.", "This movie has it all... Awesome action scenes, funny jokes, and heartbreaking deaths. The end of the movie makes you wish it was May 2019 already.", "This movie was great! It did a great job bringing characters together and action was good can't wait for the next one!", "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :) My most anticipated movie of 2018 was released a few months ago but at the time I was super busy, so I only had the opportunity to write a mini-review. Now, with Ant-Man and the Wasp coming out this week, I am writing full reviews of the 2015 Ant-Man as well as this monumental film, which features a lot of our favorite superheroes. I didn't watch a single clip or trailer for Infinity War, but my expectations were as high as ever. I went into the theater expecting to (finally) get a movie to rival with The Dark Knight for the best superhero film of all-time ... Unfortunately, I didn't get it. I will get my two issues out of the way now so I can focus on the positives because this movie has a lot of them. Being this a spoiler-free review, I can't get in-depth about its ending, so I'll do it like this. While its concept is incredibly daring and its execution seamless, the emotional impact is significantly reduced by my knowledge of the MCU's future. Everyone knows which films are being developed for Phase 4, myself included, so I can't just ignore what I know. In the same way that I consider every single movie leading up to Infinity War, I also consider the future releases, especially since this is a two-part film with an overarching story. My other problem is its balance of characters and storylines. First of all, I cannot imagine the colossal task of having to put together so many characters like the Russo brothers did. This is probably the one issue I was expecting this movie to have because I think it is impossible to perfectly balance this many groups of characters, where protagonists of their own sagas are left to secondary roles. While I do think that they mixed the characters beautifully, sometimes it felt that the film was just going from scene to scene without a real flow. There are a lot of heroes who have to be introduced and teamed up with other ones. Even with 156 minutes of runtime, it feels that they needed more time. The first half of the movie is a bit convoluted since basically, the transitions from scene to scene become repetitive and action-heavy, with no time to breathe. Sometimes it works (the opening scene is jaw-dropping), sometimes it doesn't. These are my only issues with an otherwise outstanding movie, I enjoyed every second of it! Like I said above, the Russo brothers brilliantly combined characters with one another having in mind the tone of each individual saga. Every actor and actress bring their A-game, everyone's script is excellently well-written. If I had to choose, my standouts are Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Zoe Saldana as Gamora and, saving the best for last, Josh Brolin as Thanos. Oh my God, Thanos ... Undoubtedly, the star of the film. I never expected that Thanos would have as much screentime as he did, especially when it comes to his backstory. This is the best Marvel villain yet! Even though he is a total maniac, I understand where he is coming from and his motivations are actually plausible. His story is so well-told that I almost wish that he succeeds in his mission ... How crazy is that?! When someone says \"CGI villain\", everyone instantly associates that to a horrible and depthless character. Well, Thanos is the exception to the rule because not only the CGI is mind-blowing, his characterization is amazing. Every single second that he is on-screen, I can feel it. His menacing and powerful presence is indescribable in words, you have to see it to believe it. I repeat: best Marvel villain to date! The action is one of the best in the MCU. The fact that this was the first movie in the history of cinema to ever be entirely shot with IMAX cameras definitely elevates every single set piece. Every sequence feels astonishingly epic and the Russo brothers are part of a very small group of directors who can seamlessly handle shaky-cam. Even in the first half, there are so many entertaining action scenes, cleverly filmed and with fantastic visual effects. Nevertheless, the big spectacle is saved for the third act where everything feels like I am watching those last epic battles in The Lord of the Rings franchise. Winter Soldier and Civil War might have better choreography and longer takes of action, but when it comes to the enormous and boundless sequences, Infinity War brings it home with bone-chilling charges on armies and exciting epicness levels. Also, the score is sensational and it definitely helps to raise a few goosebumps both in the emotional and action moments. It is hard to rank it inside the MCU and even harder to do it inside the superhero genre. I do not have the ability or knowledge to do it know. However, it is a ground-breaking and unique film, for sure. There is no other movie with such high stakes as this. Don't get me wrong, even though this film is dark and tragic, the Marvel humor is as funny as ever. In such an action-heavy flick, having the sometimes exaggerated Marvel comedy is a breath of relief and if there is a movie that needs it, is this one. Congrats to the Russo brothers! I never imagined the day where I could experience a film with so many superheroes, let alone such a magnificent one. Avengers: Infinity War is a ground-breaking movie in the genre, it has some of the most epic superhero action I have ever witnessed and one of the best villains of the genre's history, Thanos. This had everything to be an A+ but some issues with its ending and with the overall balance of characters and their storylines bring it down a bit. Still, it is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films ever and I can't wait to watch again!", "So how many times can you make a movie with the exact same plot. Apparently, as many times as you want . Seriously, too many of these movies, the studies should be investing in something more original and new. I started watching this and I could tell what was going to happen after 5 minutes. I won't be watching anymore of these movies.", "I have the feeling that the makers of this film wanted it to be \"The Empire Strikes Back\" of the MCU. Without speaking to any story details, I'll say that from the very opening scene until the final shot of the film (and the post-credits preview scene) it's a \"downer.\"  So, if you're the type of movie-goer who feels entertained by emotional downers, then you'll enjoy this film. My guess, however, is that most people who go to a Marvel film expect action AND a \"feel good\" at the end. That's not this film. I'm glad I waited for the Amazon & iTunes RENTAL to come out...this is not a film I want to own, or will watch again.", "The problem with the film is to weak some strong characters:\n", "Perfectly balanced, as all things should be Thanos did nothing wrong\n5/10", "The directer successfully combines all superheros together. However, the plot is so predictable, for example we all know Thanos will retreat all stones one by one in the first half, and there will be a huge combat between all superheros and villains like avengers1 and avengers2. In the meanwhile, detail is terrible. The directer uses only a few words to generalize a long storie like when nat meets burce, nat only says hi Bruce to express her feelings.", "SPOILER: After carefully thinking about this movie its safe to say its garbage.  why is it garbage?  1. The ending is pathetic we know the heros will be back and we know it will all lead into the next movie why give us a cop out ending. Maybe it be nice if they keep the heros who vanish at the end dead. Also be nice if they do kill off all the heros at the end for good in the last movie so they can focus on the newer ones. 2. its cliche and bland. And quite boring. Dont get me wrong I loved every marvel movie expect this black panther and dr. strange. I like my movies to not be the same recycled crap. 3. we waited 10yrs for this?  4. Dr. Dickhead ruined everything. 5. Thanos was pretty meh. 6. Alot of stupid decisions. 7. God forbid you say this movie is shit everybody bugs out. Sorry that I can see through crap and you cant. 8. You better off paiding to see deadpool 2 way better then this crap. 9. hoping the last one be worth it and they can give us a good ending in which the villain wins for once", "Typical Avengers film. Lots of action, funny lines and unbelievable plot. Does not deserve a 9! Cmon!", "Even though the storyline is nothing like the comic, it was very enjoyable and I do like how they approached it without having the rights to all the original characters involved. The movie was action packed and hilarious. I look forward to how they'll proceed from here.", "Unfortunately, this much-hyped Marvel film fails to live up to the hype. The film surrounds basically all characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (sans Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Wasp) as they must fight to stop an evil villain named Thanos, who wants to destroy half the world's population. Josh Brolin does an impressive job voicing Thanos, working to make him both depraved but also somewhat understandable as well. The visual effects are generally impressive, with the notable exception of Thanos' henchmen, whose CGI looks quite cheesy and almost akin to the villains in \"Justice League.\" Unfortunately, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" has an array of flaws. The first flaw is that the movie is almost impossibly convoluted. I consider myself a casual Marvel fan who has seen most MCU movies, and have seen a little over half of them in theaters (Iron Man, Thor, Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron, Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War.) I fully acknowledge the fact that I am unlikely to take away as much from this film as a hardcore fan. However, parts of the film were still difficult to follow--and I followed Civil War just fine. Additionally, while the film is ambitious, it is just unfortunately too overstuffed. There are too many characters and subplots to care about, so much that the audience becomes less engaged in the story until late in the narrative. I believe it would have been better to sort of \"split up\" some non-primary characters between this movie and 2019's \"Avengers 4.\" This would allow for audiences to take away more from the two films. While the action is generally thrilling, it lacks a scene that feels wholly unique as compared to other superhero films. The climactic battle in Wakanda shown in the trailers, while a good scene, is pretty similar to other \"large-scale people running\" type battles in movies like the Lord of the Rings series. I guess I was hoping for an action piece that felt really unique to the specific movie itself like Civil War's airport scene or Black Panther's Busan car chase scene. I will not give away any details about the ending, although I will say that it didn't work for me and made it hard for me to suspend disbelief. Due to its overstuffed nature and overtly convoluted plot, I cannot say this film met my expectations. 5/10 Note: I saw this movie in IMAX 3D. The picture and sound quality were both very good, although the 3D was weak and did not really add anything.", "Watched this film at a mid-night screening this morning. After having a bit of sleep and some time to process what I watched earlier, I can honestly say the Film was absolutely breathtaking at times just didn't seem to let up with all emotion I was feeling while watching. Character interplay was spot on too, adding humour at the right time. Also couldn't help feel a bit sympathy towards Thanos, could understand his reasoning even though his actions were a bit self-centred, although I couldn't help feel for him what he had to kill Gamora to get the soul stone. Her death and Loki's death really hit home how high the stakes have been raised. For me one of the biggest surprises of the film was the return of a character thought dead (The Red Skull) Didn't actually expect the ending, had thought with it being a Marvel Film, the heroes would save the day at the last minute, but no Marvel when down the dark route and let Thanos succeed in wiping out half of the universe, which for me makes the film even more special. The Directors/Marvel have set the bar with this film and are going to have to pull out all the stops next year if they want the next part to be just as good.", "Worth to wait for 10 years and can't wait for the second part", "Though surprisingly rich, the film's storyline remains incomplete. Feels more like several movies squished together. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be. A massive spectacle full of fun character moments and impressive action sequences. It is an entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions. Also it is too long, too dark and too confusing but the humor and all star cast helps you endure the overrunning length. On the whole, \"Infinity War\" is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that puts all the good guys against the ultimate big bad for a better universe.", "They killed my favourite character in the first minute of the movie.\nPlus unlike the other movies it lacks humour and heart.\nIt seems like it's just non stop fighting and everybody keeps dying.\nThen there is the big bad supervillain Thanos, who actually isn't really evil at all it seems as he really cares about Gamorra and is actually trying to save the universe. So that leaves me feeling a bit ambiguous and confused.\nThey also really underused Groot, he just hangs about doing not very much and to top it off, they kill Groot in the end (along with mostly everybody else)\nHow on earth can you kill Groot? That is just sad and depressing, like this movie.\nSo sorry but everything that I loved about all the Marvel movies is just thrown to the side for this film. You will love it if you like amazing fightscenes, but that is about all this movie is, one fightscene after another where the Avengers get their ass kicked and die.", "Weaving together such a big star cast is impossible, but somehow the Russos have pulled off a stunning movie that weaves together what seems like multiple movies in one.The visuals, scripting and execution are excellent.  They do not seem tedious for such a long movie, as there is sufficient change between scenes to impart a quality of its own to each moment. Like when Dr. Strange and Iron man team up - to when Thanos arrives on Wakanda - each scene lives and breathes completely on its own.  Ultimately - this is Thanos' movie. They have done such a spectacular job with the villain in this one, you just have to gasp at multiple points. Thanos is successfully portrayed as the epitome of evil - which at its worst, is also seductive, and impossible to resist.  A 10/10 from me. A thorough entertainer inspite of the dark tone.", "How does an audience connect with a giant purple cg Josh Brolin? Younger people will have no problem with it I suspect. They are part of the gaming generation/culture. For those who desire an experience that is bit more grounded. Blast off in your rocket pack. So much of this movie is cgi it becomes distracting and even corny. The script tries to weave too many characters into a straight forward story. The result is a messy flat video game movie the equivalent to children playing with their action figures at recess.", "Some could argue that the booming comic book film industry has grown a little stale since its inception with 2000's blockbuster X-men. Some argue that it's just the same shtick of hero-fights-bad-guy. There are a few titles that have been absolute standouts that work in a vacuum as a piece of media, such as the Dark Knight trilogy and Logan. However, one disappointment I've long held is that the stories don't feel like a comic book. Naturally, stuff is inherently lost in adaptation from comic book to the big screen. If you want to see what happens when we try to re-create media in a new medium, you need look no farther than 2014's The Killing Joke. The last third of the film was nearly panel-by-panel identical to the original comic, but most fans would tell you that the comic is still head and shoulders above. But, that's neither here nor there. The essence or flavor of comic books was perfectly expressed in Sam Raimi's Spider-man Trilogy (yes, even the third one). The stories seemed to juggle subplot and characters, but the narrative weaved them all together effortlessly. Some of the most effective moments in a film were just that - moments. These films showed a deep respect and appreciation for comic books.  Then, Batman and Iron Man show up, and the stories gained a new form. Like I said, adaptations inevitably require changes, but it seemed like the studios had abandoned this style. I did see glimpses of it in films like the first Avengers and in Civil War, but for the most part, I was slightly disappointed.  Infinity War brings it back. It feels like an event comic. The story trades back and forth between several subplots, the heroes don't need to explain who they are or their backstory and motivations because we already know these characters, we've spent films with them. The villain is menacing and memorable (I'd say even more compelling than Thanos in the original Infinity Gauntlet comic). Characters die and there's already setup for them to come back. The story is somehow organically a collection of moments yet still somehow flows as a compelling whole.  Avengers: Infinity War is a big, dumb, action flick. The dialogue, shot composition, editing, etc., are all above-average, but none of it is pushing cinema to new heights. What makes it great is the feeling it can give the audience thanks to great characters and good storytelling.", "If you are someone who likes watching fireworks shows this special-effects saturated epic might be your cup of tea. But I had to constantly resist the urge to check my phone messages. \nI have to say the ending was unexpected and Marvel deserves plaudits for switching things around. The rest, unfortunately, was a pretty standard superhero movie.", "This is a very standard marvel movie. If you are not heavily invested in the characters, it will be very boring. It drags quite a bit. Many things conveniently happen solely because they advance the plot. Certain characters like Thanos and Dr.Strange have inconsistent rules concerning their powers. In some scenes Thanos can instantly disable attackers, in others he struggles for no reason other than they wanted to fit in another fight scene and some more banter or cameos. Iron man's suit is really cheesy as he can materialize different weapons out of nothing because of \"nanobots\". Again, the humor is only funny if you like the characters. Otherwise you'll roll your eyes at two bland characters bantering back and forth to no real consequence. To be fair, I did like that they didn't pull any punches with the ending but they will probably bring all those characters back to life anyway so it doesn't really matter. I did like the look of some of thanos' henchmen as well. But like most marvel movies, it is the same predictable, boring, cgi film that doesn't have much depth. And i'm not a DC fanboy either, those movies suck too.", "Avengers Infinity War is probably one of the most anticipated movies of all time. With that being said it's no surprise that this film has so much weight riding on its shoulders. It seems that the biggest question most have is, Is it good? And the answer is yes, it's a pretty good film but it's not the best. First off with the good stuff. The characters are done very well, and most are given a time to shine. The Russo Brothers also do a very good job with the action, like Snyder levels of awesomeness. And it's ending is one of the best in the MCU. Now with some of the bad stuff. The sad thing is that for everything the movie does right there's something done wrong. For example, there's no substance to the film, there's nothing more to it than action. It's feels like a Micheal Bay movie at points. And the sub villains are extremely underused, there's so much promise to them but the movie hardly ever gives them a chance to shine. Is it the movie to end all movies, no. But in the end it's not a deep character study like The Dark knight nor is it as good. It's not as funny as past films and sometimes the continuity of the characters is sometimes confusing. But it's a fun blockbuster with not much more to it.", "This was epic. It has claimed my spot of favorite movie of all time. The action was AMAZING, the twists were CRAZY (seriously you don't wanna be spoiled for this). LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!", "This movie could've started with its ending. If it's a part 1 to a part 2, Marvel could've just made part 2. The action was fun. I actually enjoyed the buildup, but they dropped the ball on the ending. They just let the bad guy win. I don't watch a superhero movie to see a bad guy win. It was a waste of 3 hours.", "Fairly typical for Marvel. As with most of their films, if they cut it down by about an hour it would be good. As such it actually felt like it would, ironically, never end. The action was great and there were some very funny moments but these were quite jarring alongside the more heavy bits. It felt like the directors couldn't quite decide to wholeheartedly go comedy or serious and tried to do both. I guess the only way to stop Marvel making these films is to actually stop going to see them but somehow I always think that the next one will be better. I'm always disappointed.", "Wow this was very traumatising \nI can't wait to watch it 15 more times", "As ever with movies, avoided all the hype before seeing Avengers Infinity War. Was rather surprised to see this scoring a 9 on imdb, so guessing my rating isn't going to be popular. I should probably say from the outset that I've never been a super fan of the super hero movies.  The plot to Infinity War is pretty much the plot to most super hero movies. The plot is overlooked in favour of lots of action sequences. Personally I don't find much empathy with any of the characters. With so many of the marvel characters on show it's hard not to wonder whether the screen time is being split evenly between the big names. Talking of which I also found myself wondering whether the Black Panther got more screen time in editing after the success of the recent movie. There's no doubting that some of the visuals are dazzling. The jokes wear a bit thin after a while. If you love action movies and/or the marvel universe you will adore this film. It seems that many people who aren't must also love this film, so maybe it's just me that doesn't get it!", "Sorry...walked out feels my like I had just seen a DC movie. Depressed and forlorn.", "SPOILER: This movie too many cocktail superhero character to handle. only thing i'm happy\nThor got his eye back. Hulk is Scared and he don't wanna come out.. Lol, Missed whole movie with hulk character rather than first 5mnts. still don't understand how they miss Superman,batman,Donald duck and tom&Jerry in this movie. worst 3D, people were killing the time with mobile phones . this year so far my best entertainment film is Rampage after the movie everybody was clapping that how movie should be...............!!", "Bored me to death, very childish even you know what's coming in the next movie", "Don't come into this film expecting a masterpiece of grand proportions. The films action was above the standard for marvel movies, but the film tries to handle many plot lines at once and struggles to move much. It didn't feel like a complete movie, while I understand that it is meant to establish the next Avengers (which goes unnamed), but the entire movie didn't have a payoff, it was a movie of setting up. It was alright, but failed to meet the expectations it set of a \"cinematic experience of a lifetime\".", "I rarely write movie reviews, but I had to speak up about this one. The Avengers franchise seems to represent the moral decline that has been happening in America and around the world for the last couple of decades. The story is almost meaningless. The \"super-villain\" Thanos, if he's telling the truth about his beliefs, probably suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. The morally weak heroes, mostly white and mostly male, seem more like criminals or villains themselves than actual heroes. The only adult in the room, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, is treated by the so-called heroes as if he's either bad or doesn't know what he's doing. He is sidelined by the vigilante \"heroes\" whose only skills involve hitting, kicking, punching, smashing, destroying, and other types of violence. Doctor Strange for some insane reason just hands the Time Stone to Thanos on a silver platter, when he could have withheld it. He also magically looks at the future and sees millions of possible permutations of this scenario, but only one in which \"we\" win, but never tells the audience what those permutations are, as if Strange somehow knows much better than we do, and doesn't trust us with that information. The relationship between Peter Parker (Spiderman/Spiderboy) and Tony Stark (Iron Man) seems codependent and Stockholm-Syndromy. The conflict in the story; that a single person, with a group of magic stones from the dawn of the universe, and a magic gauntlet, could somehow wipe out half of the population of the universe with a single snap of the fingers; is utterly implausible and thus is false conflict. When a story only has false conflict, then it basically has no conflict.  One of my greatest concerns is that many young people hold these Marvel superheroes up as personal role models. Many parents these days are overwhelmed with the pressures and hardships of modern life, and it's very hard to counter these bad role models which appear in modern pop culture. My youngest son, who is now eighteen years old, seemed to love this movie, and it was difficult for me to explain to him just how bad it really was. He's inexperienced and naive, and it's hard for him to understand that these self-described \"heroes\" were anything but. Throughout the film, I wished that these \"heroes\" would just step aside and let law enforcement do their job. The cliff-hanger at the end was obviously just a scheme to get us to pay to see another installment or two of this garbage. Fortunately, we just rented it on Amazon, so we weren't out too much money, but I think we'll skip the next couple of movies, thank you very much.", "I didn't like this about the ending because thanos won everyone disappeared in the movie", "I don't give very many movies a 10 ... actually none at all, besides this one. The reason is, there is not really a dull moment in the movie. I actually cheered and clapped at one point in the movie. You'll know when it happens ;). The action is there, the comedy is where it should be. They did a great job in balancing out all the marvel characters into this amazing movie. If you haven't seen it yet and are reading these reviews to see whether or not \" it's the movie for you.\" Do you self a favor to all of us. Don't see it. You my friend are not worthy. :). Just watch it ! Thank you for everyone who participated in making this movie possible. They don't get the credit they deserve. Hats off to you. Be proud. When sitting through the credit remember the people's names across the screens cause they contributed to movie history. I thank you.", "After watching countless super hero movies and older avengers tv series's I was worried that the movie won't have any surprises left to give us. The writers did an amazing job giving us new material and a tremendous job bringing such a large and diverse set of superheroes together in an organic way that works well. Kudos to the whole Avengers team !", "\"There was an idea. To bring together a group of remarkable people. To see if they could become something more. So when we needed them. They could fight the battles that we never could.\" It's opened everyone. 10 years worth of storytelling, world building, character development, it's all led to this. One last warning this is the SPOILER review. Don't read anymore if you haven't seen it!! To spoil it is to take away the experience. This truly is a cinematic achievement. Nothing has ever reached to this scale before. It's the ultimate pay off. So the biggest question is, was it worth the wait? YES. Yes it was. I'm honestly floored by this film. It's so much better than it has any right to be. By god though did Marvel do it. They actually did it. This is the most ambitious movie they've made yet, and I really enjoyed myself. It's like they've taken all of our criticisms of the previous films and gave it their all with this one. They did not hold back. It actually shocks me that Disney even let them make this movie because there is so much devastation and heartbreak that happens, but I'm proud of them for trusting Marvel to make this. I can't imagine how they had to sell the deaths of characters like Groot or Spider-Man like can you imagine asking the Disney execs to sign off on that? So you can only imagine what my reaction was to all of this. I laughed, I cheered, and I cried. I cried! Let me just start off though that I am completely aware this movie is not perfect, not even the Empire Strikes Back is, but that doesn't mean it overshadows the rest of it all. Let me start off with what didn't work for me. I didn't like how the Black Order was handled. They were intimidating but we didn't know much about them. The most we get about them is that they're the loyal children of Thanos? Ebony Maw or Squidward as Tony calls him, was probably the most memorable one because we got his name and they slowed down to focus on his dialogue. The other ones like Proxima Midnight? I think that's the only other name I heard. They just seemed like meaningless obstacles that had little development. They work fine as henchmen, but nothing more. What else did I not like? Nothing. I loved everything else. I'm trying to hear out everyone's issues with this movie and the only one I can maybe agree with is the ending feels cheap because we know it's only part 1 of 2 movies. So all the characters who vanished we know are coming back. That's not the point to me though. The point is that Marvel understands they've been criticized for not taking chances, that they play things too safe and that there are never consequences in their movies. So they had the guts to kill off nearly half of our beloved heroes in front of our very eyes. Now I don't know about you, but I lost it. Watching Groot vanish while Rocket wept. Watching Spider-Man tremble into Tony's arms begging for his life, was just soul shattering to watch on screen. I cried a lot during this movie. I cried for Loki, Gamora's entire story, Tony's fakeout death, when Spider-Man started to vanish, and even when Cap did everything he could to hold back Thanos. The biggest thing I appreciate about this film is how it just doesn't ever slow down. The pace is excellent. People might see this as a negative but I think this is a good thing because when you have this massive event with this many characters you just have to keep it moving. There's always something happening on screen whether if it's character banter, developing Thanos, or just insane action. I was never bored and I was just really engaged from beginning to end. The tones all blend really well too. It's funny when it needs to be, but it's not afraid to punch you in the gut and make you choke up like \"did that really just happen?\" Marvel actually had stakes and tension throughout the entire thing and I was so nervous waiting for each scene to play out. By the time credits rolled I was so traumatized I felt like I needed therapy LOL. Each character reacts the way they usually would and I'd totally debate people on that. The Russo Brothers clearly talked to all the other Marvel filmmakers and give each character at least one thing to do. That's all you can really wish for, the fact that they even had this many characters in the film and still made it work is nothing short of a miracle, because it could've been a complete disaster. Let me talk the biggest force of this movie though. The villain. Is Thanos a good villain after all this time? I would argue he's even better than I thought he would be. I think his plan is very profound for a guy who literally wants to wipe out half the universe. He wants balance in a world(universe) where people constantly struggle and suffer from just life. That he feels he's doing everyone a favor. These are what the good villains do. They don't wake up in the morning and think IM GONNA BE BAD TODAY. I still can't believe it's Josh Brolin because the cgi looked so good on him. He's definitely a highlight of the movie without a doubt. I guess it's time to predict what happens next, so we know now that Thanos has achieved his goal. People are vanishing left and right while he sits peacefully as he said he would. However we all know if people just vanished, there's a high probability they'll come back. The one thing I noticed is the ones who mostly made it are the original Avengers team minus War Machine, Rocket, Nebula, and Okoye. I wonder if there's some sort of significance to this as why the original Avengers survive and the newer ones and most of the Guardians did not. Of course the answer lies with Dr. Strange looking into the future and acknowledging there being only one possible outcome where they win out of millions(billions?) of outcomes. And we know that prior to that moment Strange made it clear that if it came to Tony or Spider-Man's life over the stone that he would not hesitate to let them die. However he gives up the stone to save Tony. So he knows Tony is a key for this outcome and that he must survive. Also Captain Marvel must play some large role in all of this henceforth the post credits scene. There's a lot of anticipation for Avengers 4. Like what it will be called. How is everyone saved, and more importantly will Thanos help to reverse it all or will he fall into madness till the Avengers overpower him? There's a lot to look forward to and I sure hope Avengers 4 can have the same level of impact this movie did because Infinity War knocked out of the park for me. This movie is an experience and that's why I can give it the highest honor of a 10/10. Now does this mean it's a perfect film? No, not on my scale. A 10/10 simply means this movie met and exceeded all my expectations. It engaged me from beginning to end. It got me to feel so many different emotions. I'm proud of Marvel for bringing us 10 years worth of stories and more to come. Go see it In IMAX if you can, it was phenomenal. Thank you Marvel. - 10/10", "Infinity War is the pinnacle of what blockbuster films should be. Directed by the Russo brothers, they manage to achieve the almost impossible feat of culminating all the characters and their stories into one epic film. The action, the characters, the story and the overall experience is spectacular to behold. Each characters has their own moment to shine, as we see new fun and somewhat emotional interactions between characters and story arcs that pay off as the film progresses . The result is a film that often feels surprisingly earnest and emotional. It pays off our emotional investment into these great characters over each of the 18 previous films through a great culmination of storytelling. The humor we have come to expect in Marvel films is lively and full of banter, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the quick-fire interplay between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike Marvel's cascade of villains who are turned secondary to their superhero counterparts, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is the central character in this epic, with a moral compass that is beyond what many might expect. Whilst he may seem to be the most demonic villain that the Avengers have come across, he is by far and away the most complex of them all, testament to the directing and writing of the film. There's a lot going on in this movie, with many scenes occurring almost simultaneously, leaving the ending on a much vague yet appropriate cliffhanger. Overall, Infinity War epitomizes the perfect blockbuster film that ends in poetic grace and is sure to leave you questioning what will happen next.", "I was underwhelmed a bit by the sheer amount of fighting, hacking, slashing, jumping, beating and stabbing. At moments it felt like a lord of the rings ripp off with the mighty power of the 6 stones (one ring to rule them all). And over all didn't the big master plan of thanos make any sense: whipe out half the population of everywhere will make what better, exactly?\nSo what's left are some funny moments, some childish gags, mixed cg (thanos looked great in the close ups, but when rendered full scale his lip movements looked that fake like Dr. Manhattan's from the watchmen film). \nSo we are half way through saving the world again. What comes next?", "Take a 15 minute Captain Planet episode and stretch it out to three dreadful hours of CGI fight scenes of people you don't care about. There is nothing to keep someone over the age of 13 interested. The plot is nonsensical. Big flashes, loud noises, and cramming in every Marvel superhero for a 2minute scene just made the movie seem like one endless \"star\" cameo after another. Avoid", "I really did try, but I just couldn't make myself care. The whole film is just one big loud flashy CGI scene after another, with no time to actually feel for the characters. They also managed to make Thanos less visually scary than in the other movies? (To quote my sister: \"He looks like a big purple thumb\".)", "I'm not a hater; I loved the first two Avengers movies and I've loved or at least enjoyed every Marvel movie I've seen. But Infinity War was designed for those fans who've seen every single movie in the Marvel universe, not people like myself who pick and choose the ones they're interested in seeing. I don't understand the compulsion to get every character from the MCU in a single movie. Even in a two-and-a-half-hour movie it waters down character development to a weak broth. I've never seen (and I never will see) a Guardians of the Galaxy movie and when I saw the talking ferret or raccoon or whatever he is and the talking walking stick onscreen in this film my heart dropped as fast as my rating for the movie. The MCU seems to be compelled to make each movie bigger and more spectacular than the last, real emotion and characters be damned. Marvel started out knowing precisely how to make great superhero films; its best effort, in my opinion, was its first, Iron Man. The scope in IM was considerably less grand, and the focus was more on emotion and the evolution of the characters, with enough thrills to keep it honest. Infinity War is about 80% thrills, and 20% emotion, with characters appearing onscreen for too short a time to make a real emotional investment in. It's as if the people in the MCU saw their competitor's dud, Batman vs. Superman and said, \"We need to make more movies like that: overblown, disjointed, everything bagels of films that end up leaving the viewer drained and disheartened.\" Without giving away much of anything to the three people on the planet who haven't seen Infinity War yet, I walk into superhero movies for escapism and hope to be uplifted a bit; I walked away from this one feeling thoroughly depressed. I give it the middling grade of five stars, and not less, because my interest in the outcome never flagged and I obviously cared enough about what was happening onscreen to be upset about it. Hopefully, Marvel will self-correct with Endgame, though judging by the incomprehensibly high grades this movie has already gotten-higher than Iron Man and the two prior Avengers films-they may never know how miserably they failed at least one viewer.", "Only Marvel can do something like this. Making an uncomplete movie but still have overhype fans.\nYou follow a story about how Thanox achieve the infinity stone. There is only 2 things that matters in the movie. Doctor Strange plan and The snap. All the superhero screentime is so useless. You can basically watch the snap and doctor strange scene and you dont miss a thing. Better make all superhero just sit on a cafe and wait for thanos to complete his thing.", "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" (2018) is a professionally produced action adventure film about The Avengers and their eventual allies coming together to stop the growing powers of Thanos, played by Josh Brolin. I must admit I felt different from the beginning of the film to the end. I will sum it up by saying, it was joyful to see so many of my favorite characters come together until the end and leave it at that. It is difficult to really dive into what this film is about without being repetitive of prior super hero movies or completely giving the film away. However, staying in tradition of a Marvel super hero film, it is a fresh take that hits most of the normal marks excluding the conclusion. The acting of this star-studded film, as expected is, dead on marvelous. It's not overly hokey like some of the hero films tend to be. The Russo brothers also did an immaculate job in directing this film. The fight scenes were very vivid and gripping in every sequence. In contrast, I do believe this film may have been a little long for my taste. I really think if the script would have been slimmed down to focus on Thanos' search for the stones and the Avengers and allies trying to stop him, there wouldn't be so many moments that feel like they drag on. I also believe there should have been some type of \"actual\" call to action for the Avengers in the end. I know there is a proposed continuation, but it feels like a lazy conclusion.", "That's what this felt like. From start to finish the assault of CGI and non-stop action never allows for moments to appreciate the scale of the conflict. The brief pauses in action that portrait Thanos help create a narrative that might be interesting if the next shot is not another scene that is hard to follow and simply drowned in computer generated shots. Suspension of disbelief cannot occur as everything seems artificial and crammed together, almost as if fearing that the viewer might look away bored by the inadequacies of this movies. Oh, the Hulk Buster is in here again because everyone like that scene in Age of Ultron. No no, don't look away, look at the Wakandan army gather to fight off space demons. WAIT! are you bored? Look at another convoluted fighting scene where characters have no time to develop, we cannot really care about their motivations and it all feels .... crowded. The movie has a few bright moments, but these seem to go by fast and at over 2 hours I wish I would be left with something more than... I kinda liked Thanos but I'm not sure about what else happened. Living in a world where everything gets dissected before it even goes live makes all of this worse, with people crowding the doors of the theaters for the next installment in the Marvel universe, makes the ending even worse. It doesn't have any weight to it. It doesn't feel final or complete. I understand that with all the hype building for the next, but at this point I feel like a cow put on to be fattened by the next and the next and the next movie, all turning into an incoherent collection of flashes employing lens flare, busy cgi and the same Orange and Blue color poster...", "How to throw all storylines on one big heap, put them through a blender and see what's left.\nWhat is the point of this movie? Find out which characters are worth saving for the next installment?\nWhat a waste.", "Very confusing story. In my personal opinion Thor should have long hair. Captain America should not have a beard and wear his uniform. Hulk should be more powerful than what was shown on this movie. Ironman's nano tech suit is a joke. The Avengers seem to have no powers in this movie.", "Just not worth it.\nSkip I if you can.\nPlus 2 1/2 hours.", "Some fun elements but the cheesy banter is so over the top. Ruins almost any pathos/empathy. The only genuine notes come from Guardians which is ironic since they are hilarious. Ok maybe Thanos is kind of interesting too. \nAnd let's talk about Vision. Biggest wuss with super powers ever. \nWorth seeing once but makes me miss DC which may be dark but I actually care what happens to a lot of those characters (ie Man of Steel and Justice League) or Deadpool in the Marvel universe.", "2.29 hrs are simply wasted. i dont know why some people telling lies about that crap , and try to proving that its an awesome movie... iam just talking to those people who planning to watch avengers infinty war, save your 2.29 hrs and spend them some other good things.. dont waste your 2.29 hrs on that crap...", "The best thing I can compare Avengers: Infinity War to is a high speed roller coaster. From the first action sequence to the last the viewer is flung around various battles, universes and emotions. Thanos was much better developed than I expected, and seeing many characters from different films finally interact was rewarding for those who have been watching MCU films since they first came out. While IW was not the best or deepest super hero movie I've seen, it is unlike any other cinematic experience I have ever had. It's easily the closest I've felt to reliving Saturday morning super hero cartoons in theaters, especially with the \"to be continued\" ending. I was expecting pure fun and I got exactly that. Can't wait for the next one.", "There is a giant plot hole in the first 5 minutes. Apparently there was a boarding party and the Hulk character was hiding and sneaking up on the enemy. That is very out of character. Normally the Hulk attacks first, directly, and loudly. That part didn't make any sense. Then the Hulk lost in a simple fist fight, when that character has been through much greater ordeals. Then the Asgard transporter is activated when the machine was already destroyed! Such sudden and severe plot holes really made me p-----... made me angry and I vowed to rate 1 star. That was only the first 5 minutes. How they decide who wins against whom is so arbitrary and capricious, and never follows any sort of logic or consistency. I am willing to suspend disbelief, but the writing must follow its own rules! Characters can be smashed by giant boulders, their skin never tears like its made of diamond, yet they bleed from a fist. Pure nonsense. It never occurs to Dr. Strange to use a portal to get back home, when that is half of what he does. Lazy writing. The rest of the movie was entertaining though, with even more plot holes, so I settled on 6.", "Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope. But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something. So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring. The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more. Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.", "Excellent visual effects, creative and artistic in 3D. Too many characters in this film with too many subplots. Many of the main superheroes have been stars in their own superhero films. Not much time spent with each one, but there were some entertaining, but brief, performances. Most of the film involved aliens and superheroes being either blown up or shot. Although I felt transported into outer space with the amazing visuals, the story seemed to never end and was predictable up until the ending. I think I saw 1,000 aliens get massacred in total. The ending stunk, a real let down.", "CUNEYT ARKIN DUNYAYI KURTARAN ADAM DA BILE BU KADAR SIKILMADIM. FILM TAMAMEN UYDURUK. COK UZATILMIS.", "It took me some time to watch this. Overall a good experience but this is not a film in the traditional sense...Sure, it's overwhelmed with liberal preaching and awesome action, but at the end of the day, it's more of a filler. Cheap thrills don't work on me, sorry, not sorry.", "I think they tried to do way too much. There's so much going on in this movie with all these different characters and it's just absolutely ridiculous. They should've stopped while they were ahead. This is just stupid!", "Infinity War could have been a great film if they just summarized the grueling excessive CGI fighting and war, cutting an hour from the length, giving time for a bit more of a breather and ending the main film with a message of hope and not in a post-credits teaser that relies entirely on outside comic-book knowledge.\nMost people I know go to see superhero movies for the escapism and to feel the triumphs of good over evil - sometimes even by the common man rising up. Marvel sometimes gets props for blurring the lines, creating complex flawed heroes, sympathetic villains and hard choices. But there still need to be the broad strokes of victory (even if with sacrifice).\nCongratulations, Marvel and the Russo Brothers, you've managed to out-bleak the darkest DC movies and I think it is a cheat of the worst kind that you will in some way \"fix\" this over several future movies. I have not felt this depleted in a long time after seeing a movie and I've heard others walking out of the theatre (or in these reviews) saying they may never watch another Marvel film if the sole focus is on stringing along the franchise and effects instead of telling a compelling tale within reasonable bounds of a single film.\nMy recommendation is to wait for video release and not reward the producers for such a half-hearted first Act without including the rest of the (potentially epic) story.", "My goal here is not to get you not to see the movie. You're going to see it anyway. It's just to help you manage your expectations. \nDo you remember the first scene in the first 'Toy Story' movie when, as part of an internal dialogue, Woody's owner says 'I brought my attack dog with a built-in force field. Well I brought my Dinosaur, who eats force-field dogs?' Well, that's the level of writing in Infinity Wars. Only they mean it. Super powers have gotten to the point that anything can be anything else. The, by now, run-of-the-mill avengers powers are simply no match for for Thanos and his buddies. And yet, the avengers find completely unexplained ways to defeat some of the minions. Nothing. Makes. Sense. Even within the context of the movie. Things just happen. Some good, and some bad. Everything is at apocalyptic scale. Huge set-pieces are inter-spliced with other huge set-pieces, and all of it really to no avail. Any interaction between characters is simply short-hand. When everything is at such a large scale, you don't give a rat's ass who lives and who dies. Or what happens. If you just want a catalog of special effects, this movie is for you. If you still have an appetite for story, character development, and chemistry, lower your expectations.", "I want to say I loved it but I just can't. Too long, too many characters and the plot is just a lot like the other movies from the MCU: predictable. The actors were amazing, though.", "Much like matrix reloaded or empire strikes back the movie is\n \"to be continued\" so what we have here is half of an ok movie with no real end and an annoying massive cliff hanger.\nso here's half a review...", "Infinity War has it all and takes your emotions, your life, and soul to a place you didn't believe existed", "He is a sentimental proletarian, willing to sacrifice his life's favorite to rectify this chaotic and overcrowded universe. After the renovation, he didn't want to engage in slavery or become an emperor. Instead, he lived in seclusion in the mountains and forests. Watching the sunset, he lamented the uncertainty of life and perhaps had time to raise chickens and other vegetables. Reducing half of the population in a random way also reflects its fairness and innovation, which is a rare example in boss.", "Avengers: Infinity War is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It is 10 years in the making, with 20 instalments leading up to it, all designed to introduce our lineup of 30 odd characters and hint at fragments of Infinity War plot throughout. When I left the cinema I couldn't quite believe the Russo brothers had actually managed to pull it off. On the face of it, the film should be a total mess, with too many characters and too many storylines unfolding in unison. But they absolutely smash it, creating a masterpiece which the likes of have never been seen before and most likely will never be seen again. Thanos is the ultimate villain and about the best I've seen - not just in the superhero genre. His motives and actions throw your moral compass into disarray, creating a dynamic viewing experience. What's more, I can't think of any other film in the MCU where we don't genuinely believe from the outset that our heroes will survive and prevail to save the day, but with Infinity War these certainties cannot be so assured - the stakes are so much higher. The opening scene sets the tone, and from here on in there is no guarantee who will be left standing when the final credits role. The story throws together characters from across the franchise in the most unexpected fashion - Thor teaming up with his good friends Rabbit and Tree; Tony Stark and Peter Quill fighting Thanos side by side. So much enjoyment stems from these unlikely groupings, and watching all these characters who we know and love, interacting and bouncing off each other, is just the definition of entertainment. In the end Infinity War has you laughing and crying, often in the same scene, with a finale so shocking and unanticipated that it doesn't lose its impact no matter how many times you watch it over. Overall it is the best Marvel has to offer, and I don't think it will ever be topped. 10/10.", "So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!", "Great ending to a wonderful adaptation to the series. Well done Stan would be proud!", "This movie was pretty fun I guess. Not sure I get all the hype but then again I didn't see many of the other Marvel movies. A fun time but I didn't really see anything too special about it.", "I'd say that, overall, Endgame is a fun-ish movie. But I also thought that it jumped around quite a bit which made it difficult to feel immersed and connected with the characters. As soon as you started getting invested in one plot line, you were quickly whisked away to something else going on in another part of the Marvel Universe. In addition to this, there are some odd joking moments that don't fit in well with the plot and characters and can take you out of the action if you're sensitive to those sorts of things; you'll throw out an eye roll a few times throughout this movie. But overall, it's not a horrible movie!", "I hate Thor films honestly i just don't care for the character its boring garbage plus its performed by one of the worst actors ever Chris Hemsworth the makes or studio should replace him and then ill might actually see one fully rather than skipping to next chapter or seek to a particular scene only Hela was good in Ragnarock thanks to Cate Blachette now coming back to this film all i have to say is that infinity war is the only watchable and repeatable film in marvel phase 3 seriously it holds some level of quality and standard the makers really pushed it and i found myself liking it,Thanos was well done here strong and cool,i just recently watched endgame 2019 and it was bad no action only talk it doesn't matter if it made huge money at box office i wont waste my cash over that kid of nonsense ill take this infinity war any day,you can see my endgame review if you click on my profile button it will take you to the main area my channel page.\ni am going to make it short from here because what i am about to say might worry some people i am fan of both marvel and dc and its sad to see whats going on recently marvel still doing nice but dc is in a mess the last good dc films were the dark knight trilogy of christian bale as batman honestly,both marvel and dc comics film makers need to up their game i really hope that black widow and Eternals movies will do great in phase 4 & dc should start all over cancel justice league and wonder woman as dc movies are not working at all reboot everything again they must because if they don't then its really endgame for them not joking because guys a new comic book hero is about to enter the competition soon in the valiant comic universe based on valiant comics Vin Diesel will star as bloodshot in the film the quality level on that film will be insane it will defeat and own these kids at marvel and dc comics its going to be extreme and Rated R not for kids,so marvel and both dc should start aiming at adults,this avengers infinity war was good attempt but again they need to stop making films pg or lame for kids marvel and dc need to grow up endgame and justice league are examples of poor film making.why not make animation entirely then if they want to cater to the kids,if you are making a feature live film then better make it good,this one film showed that it was worth the effort and not really about money the acting,story everything was good,you cant go and make a comic book film without a Cgi what would that be it would be just another movie with actors acting and there are films like that out there like Jason Bourne or some Steven Seagal films etc so this one was a good mix of Cgi and live action,endgame really made me angry as everything looked out of place,infinity was set a standard and marvel blew the chance and ruined the sequel movie,always remember that a good film is not about awards or cash it made at box office its about repeat value look at the matrix trilogy of Keanu Reeves i know i am going off topic a big but yes that's how films should be made so these guys better watch out and fix their mistakes or on purpose errors,infinity war made me glued to the seat and not move for this nice film my rating is 5/10 and i love iron man.watch it", "What just happened? from the first minute it was kicked off with action, and never really stopped. it was fight after fight after fight. it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and also made me very emotional. very well done", "After watching was just staring at the screen for the whole cast, such a powerful heroes in Avengers cannot beat Thanos, first thought doesn't make sense, so how powerful the Thanos is, just took 6 infinity stones with ease, that's too bad for Avengers, the dynamic of the whole movie is really great! At the end the Thanos flipped the fingers half of the heroes became dust and left away, millions form of life left away made feel super upset, hope Avengers 4 will beat Thanos with ease too! Expecting Avengers 4", "Despite the grandeur and stunning effects and production of this movie, I am sad to report that I can't bear to watch this movie again, unlike the other movies in the MCU which I enjoy watching again and again. Simply because the direction of the franchise was to make the Avengers lose at this point. I just can't shake the feeling of frustration in the way they made Thanos and his henchmen so powerful and nearly invincible, and the Avengers (namely Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, Vision) helpless against them. Of course, the producers, director and writers had to do this because that's the direction they wanted it to go - and I just can't stand to see it again. I can't stop myself from thinking of all those other possible ways of how each Avenger could have easily defeated the villains in the different scenes. But, of course, if the writers or producers allowed that, then the Avengers would have easily won the infinity war and Thanos wouldn't look so formidable and inevitable. But that is the direction they chose for the franchise - to make Thanos inevitable. When, in fact, there are so many ways Thanos did NOT have to be inevitable. So this is where this movie just loses me as a fan. Watching it once was enough. The plot was to make the Avengers lose and weaker. It's pretty much how I feel when I first saw the first X-Men movie - they made the heroes so weak and helpless against the villains. Plot manipulated and utterly frustrating! Sorry! Nevertheless, it is still a truly stunning production!", "Yes, even better than Endgame in my opinion. Especially Thanos was insane and his win..", "This film lives up to its name \"Infinity War.\" This film is an action packed thriller with nonstop battle sequences and a few filler content along the way. The special effects and CGI is extraordinary. There are two major downsides to this film. The first and obvious one is if you have not seen any of the past 30+ Marvel movies or read any of their comics then you're not going to identify too many characters and you definitely won't know their backstory. The second downside and the one that has me giving this film a six of 10 instead of anything higher is the total lack of plot development. The plot was so poorly developed that it even affected the character development in the film. Thanos wants to wipe out lives but it never is fully explained why. He talks of his \"destiny\" and need to wipe out lives but there is no backstory explaining why. You are introduced to his relationship between him and his daughter but it is so brief that you end up with more questions than answers. The film has too many plot holes throughout that leads me to tell people who haven't seen the movie to wait until the second Infinity War movie to come out before trying to watch this one because the abrupt ending and poor storytelling will leave you very disappointed.", "It seems that the Marvel films are slowly descending into loud action set pieces without very original or daring plots. AIW is a good example of this trend. Villain Thanos (probably a shorthand for the Greek Thanatos = Death because Thanos is the bringer of death) wants to collect 5 jewels that will allow him to snuff out half the galaxy's population so the other half can live better. Supposedly he's better than Hitler because he targets casualties at random, rather than a specific group. With all the energy expended on this quest, one wonders why his plan A was not simply to provide more resources for the galaxy, so all of its inhabitants can live better lives! He is opposed by the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. in a series of set pieces for each stone. The set pieces are OK little movies, but really nothing too inventive or exciting besides the usual action mayhem. Some of it is downright stupid, like the idea that opening your shield to let badass creatures in so they don't surround your shield is good war tactics; or Thanos' henchman deploying useless badass creatures in the first place when he has giant diggers to go underneath the shield anyway. And so on, and so forth. In an effort to provide every Marvel character a few minutes of screen time, the writing is diffuse, the action generic and the whole thing too episodic. Now, if at least they were to stick with the ending (half the galaxy's population dead, Thanos wins, many Avengers turned to dust) there would be something tragic about the \"Hitler wins\" plot. But of course we all know they'll come back to life magically in the next installment, as hinted by Dr. Strange towards the end of the film. So therefore who cares if Gamora gets thrown to her Death. She'll be back soon enough. It's a bit sad because Thanos is a pretty good villain as Marvel villains go, and he deserved a punchier, more coherent film. Still, it's OK to watch once, and fans of the Marvel universe will of course find endless trivia in this movie, while those not familiar with MU will be slightly confused. It's a trend these days: theatrical releases becoming more like episodes in an old-fashioned 70s mini-series; and Netflix miniseries becoming better than theatrical releases. Ah well.", "My greatest fear of endless war was as follows:\n1- How are they going to gather so many heroes and make them non-disposable? 2 - how are they going to make a villain so AWESOME that it makes sense for so many heroes to come together to defeat him. And the film responded to me in the most incredible way:\nEach hero has his role in the plot, as are 4 jewels to be protected the film made situations for the heroes to meet and protect these jewels, and these situations are great.\nThe villain is generic, but as the film presents us he is better able to perceive his motivations and that he is not simply generic but unique.\nAn incredible movie with beautiful scenery, breathtaking action sequences and a script that gets better as we know the marvel universe better", "An almost perfect movie!! For a long time, we're waiting for a superhero movie that is not clich\u00e9ic and boring, and we have Deadpool,but Infinitty War is a visual show, and it's worth our time. I can hardly wait for Avengers Endgame next year", "If you want to envoy this movie don't watch it as a cinephile, watch it as a geek. Then all those profusion of characters which doesn't make sense will appear to be so cool that you will ask for more. Yeah \"more and more\" could be an apropriate summary and at some point I was expecting Batman and Superman joining in the battle (even if they aren't from Marvel). \nFrom a marketing point of view putting as much characters as possible isn't a bad idea since you can target the largest audience possible but as a consequence the plot is going to suffer from it. Concerning the CGI it was quite enjoyable to watch and I must admit that Thanos has a lot of personnality and was really well made. However I wasn't impressed by any of the battle's scenes and giving that budget it can be considered as a wast of money. I expected more from that film but I don't want to be so rude and I'll give it a 6 because I was quite surprised by the ending. This may be the main strength of the movie!", "I felt duded by the ending, left hanging and wondering why they didn't mention that it was obviously a more than one part film. Up until the credits rolled I was enjoying the movie, c'mon Marvel get your act together......\nIf a movie is obviously gonna be a 2 or 3 or more parter then put Pt 1 one the first movie and go from there, ask Harry Potter if saying Pt 1 & Pt 2 ever hurt its cred !!", "It felt like this part was just a merger of all Marvel super heros with no powerful subject/story line and they just tried to give a gist of what we can expect next from the series, it felt like a total crap. It felt like they wasted not using the super heros to their core. \nBut the visuals were amazing and the villian/Thanos was stagerring. That was all.", "The way that they had all of the characters interact and come together was interesting and I liked that part.\nHowever, Thanos was the worst part of this movie. He and all his minions looked extremely fake and out of place because it was so obvious that they were CGI when standing next to the real people.\nAnd Thanos just does not look intimidating or evil. At least not like someone who is supposed to be the villain of a huge superhero movie. He seriously looked like some bodybuilder bro.\nAlso I hated how it seemed like they wanted us to feel bad for Thanos or sympathize with him. They used scenes of him and his \"daughter\" (someone he kidnapped after killing half her planet) and a scene of him crying (????) to make us like him? Um, no, his sole mission is to kill half the universe. That being said, I'm still confused by his motives. Why does he feel like he needs to balance the universe and why does he feel like it's his job to kill a bunch of people? \nHe just didn't make sense to me and it kinda ruined the movie.", "This movie doesn't deserve to be rated so high. Having a bunch more fan service, action scenes, and deaths (which was a pretty unsatisfying ending in my opinion) than the other marvel movies does not make it better. And it definitely doesn't qualify this movie to be in the top 100 films of all time (currently ranked #51 right now). Now, this isnt a bad movie. I sort of enjoyed it at times, even though it was a bit hard to keep track of the characters. Im just saying it isn't really any better than the other marvel movies, so should be ranked similarly (so around 7 to 8 stars). It isn't anything special, and definitely isnt a \"masterpiece\" as one reviewer put it. Its just an entertaining action movie (although the ending was not entertaining and was just disappointing). My feelings about this movie might just be because I dont really care about the characters. I was annoyed every time a character came on the screen and people started to applaud, and I didnt really care that half the characters died at the end because I wasnt emotionally invested in them (because there are just too many of them in my opinion). The only characters that were sort of sad to see die were spiderman (because he sounded so scared) and nick fury (because Sam L Jackson is awesome). Otherwise, I was just waiting for that depressing end to be over. Maybe if I read the comics I would be more affected by this film. Im assuming that is where most of the 10/10 stars came from. However, a movie shouldn't depend on people having read the comics, and as someone who hasnt read them and doesnt care about most of the characters because of the lack of time the movies spend developing the characters, this movie was slightly disappointing and also doesnt deserve the rating it has now.", "I was really digging this movie and then the plot started to unfold and I'm sitting there thinking yep this movie was directed by a guy. The whole scarlet witch thing who in their right mind would choose one person over the whole universe, it made her seem like such a weak, selfish character and to add vision isn't even a person HE'S A ROBOT that tony made in his lab and yeah he's evolving and stuff but he's still isn't human and they all acting like his life is so important its not!. The ending feels like it only ended that way so everyone would be like omg no I can't believe that happened, just for shock value, the only way it could have ended worst is if they all woke up from a dream.", "This film is far better than the previous two Avengers films. It balances all its characters and settings with a deft hand. This time, the central thread is the villain Thanos who is portrayed by Josh Brolin. He is a brooding figure with a false sense of wisdom and he is the true star of this film. Everything else is amazing - the story, the action, the effects, the stakes. Before this, I was not very familiar with the Marvel Cinematic Universe so I didn't recognise half the characters and scenarios, but this film just pulls you along for the ride so you don't necessarily have to know everything beforehand.", "It seems Doctor Strange vastly underused his powers in New York when Thanos' henchmen come to take the time stone. Later, Doctor Strange is using his full arsenal while battling Thanos one-on-one, so it seems strange he doesn't use his full powers earlier. Also, the whole side-quest where Thor and Rocket embark on a mission to get a new hammer for Thor is boring and could have been deleted to shorten run-time. Captain America's entrance into the movie by saving Vision is really cool and the Wakanda fight scenes are entertaining. The end where Thanos actually captures all six infinity stones is a surprising twist and kind of cool knowing the Avengers lost this round, but will surely be back for more. For the most part, Marvel needs to be applauded for meshing all their characters into a solid, entertaining movie, that's not without inconsistencies, but a pretty good all around Avenger movie.", "After a powerhouse phase 3 Infinity arrived on a gigantic mound of expectations and it mostly delivers but can't escape feeling a little unfinished. That being said the action scenes are spectacular and the downer ending is emotionally draining as expected. Everyone's in the top of their game here as they rush trying to stop Thanos. And despite a dark premise there's lots of laughs along the way as well as tears. From the opening moments you know the game is real. The events are shocking and yet it's still exciting to see our favorite characters come together especially a hilarious Thor and star lord and a lovable and heartbreaking spider man. But the real goods belong to a wonderful layered Robert Downey Jr. The best thing about this film is that it leaves you wanting the next chapter desperately.

The actors pour their hearts out into every scene and the story is brilliant bringing lots of great twists and turns! The cinematography in this movie is beautiful making it visually stunning. The characters are also very interesting and you care about most of them. I recommend this Avengers film.", "Avengers infinity war is exciting and hilarious. avengers infinity war is directed by the Russo brothers who also made captain america the winter soldier and civil war. The characters are combined in new and interesting ways and that is especially the case with Thor Rocket and Groot,The three of them were hilarious. There is also tension because you want to know what happens and who will survive the story. the film is well filmed and the action is well captured. the special effects are impressive and the music by Alan Silvestri is very good. the movie is well acted and especially thanos played by Josh Brolin is well played. Avengers infinity war is one of the best marvel movies and I definitely recommend it.", "Okay it's good and everything. But how's that 8.5 not lowered since November 19th, 2018 when it had 522,000 votes!!!", "I think this is true for all the superhero movies, they are degrading with time. And definitely getting worse and worse as you watch them again. I found so many things that just don't make sense, that I keep lowering my rating. For example I don't get why Thanos fights after he gets the reality stone. He would have needed to give a heavenly reality to all of his opponents, then he could kill whomever he wanted without any fights. And no survivor would have any problems with it, since they wouldn't know :DDD. My list of such things like this is already too long, so I'm not gloing to watch it again, othertwise, it would get just one star.", "Brief parts were interesting and exciting but frankly most of it was predictable and cringe-worthy. It was better then Infinity War but that was terrible so nothing to be proud of. Only one real good part and that was about 10 seconds long in a 3 hour movie, goes on for too long at the end with nothing happening", "Special effects are great as usual, and the movie is alright in general, but am I the only one who thinks they could have just cut his arm off while they had him. Seriously now. Seriously.", "I've enjoyed most of the Marvel Universe films but I wasn't as taken with this, basically a little of everyone's favourite characters, but equally not enough of everyone's favourite characters combined to make a slightly less than memorable movie. One thing though, this was a movie with a message that humanity cannot continue wasting the resources of this planet or face the loss of at least half of what we have on this little planet of ours. Credit for that as we need to wake up to a very harsh future if we carry on as is.", "I'm no fanboy, but I'm not a hater either. I've watched 15 or so of the MCU films and I've loved a few of them (Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Avengers Assemble, Civil War, Ragnarok) and at least enjoyed most of the rest. The plot really is the problem here. The characters do stupid or out of character things just to move the film forward. My biggest problem is the scene on Titan where Iron Man, Dr Strange, Spiderman, Star Lord, Drax & Mantis try to take the gauntlet from Thanos. Once Mantis has Thanos' mind subdued there was any number of ways in which they could have won the fight right there. In fact, they *were* winning the fight. They nearly had the gauntlet off (in the slowest, most difficult way possible ... why didn't they hack Thanos' arm off?) Instead, they bicker like children and Starlord slaps Thanos, breaking the mind control allowing Thanos to win and escape. This was so unsatisfying as to spoil the whole film for me. I totally didn't buy Thanos' love for Gamora. That came out of nowhere and was just a cheesy plot device to elicit an emotional reaction from the audience. It also provided a framework to hang the recovery of the soul stone on, otherwise it would have been as exciting as a UPS delivery. On the subject of Thanos, his motive for assembling the stones is lame. To snap his fingers and destory half of the beings in existence. For \"balance\". Wut? Ok, it makes a terrifying objective, but is very shallow. Another recurring problem was the complete lack of logic in some of the fights. There's a basic problem of combining ordinary humans, albeit highly skilled and trained, with superhumans, be they gods, titans, aliens or whatever. Characters that were utterly outclassed inexplicably lasted more than a few seconds. Black Widow against any of the Black Order should have only one outcome, very quicly. The Black Order wiped the floor with Scarlet Witch and Vision (who is powered by an Infinity Stone!) yet Black Widow doesn't die against them. Twice. BW is cool and all, but is just an un-augmented, highly skilled human. Sorry, nah. Also, that Black Order dude who wrapped Thor up in metal at the start gets killed cheesily by Iron Man blowing a hole in his spaceship. Nah, not buying that either. Thanos' power was theoretically increasing hand over fist (sorry) with every Infinity Stone he gained, but he won or lost fights throughout the film not based on how powerful he is but by whether or not the plot need a win or loss to move forward. Many other encounters in this logicless vein. Cheesy deaths. You just know that most of the characters who died will come back. Therefore there is no gravitas to any of it. Cheap tricks. It *was* visually spectacular and I thought the script was pretty good, where it wasn't labouring under ridiculous plotting. The action scenes were spectacularly good as usual, if wildly illogical at times. Overall, not as satisfying as I wanted it to be. Like I say, i'm no fanboy but I was ready to love this film.", "I have to admit I wasn't a fan of superhero movies . Besides ''Iron Man 1'', ''Thor 1 '' and ''Guardians of the Galaxy 1 '' I haven't seen any other movie from Marvel . But this movie completely changed my perspective . As soon as I saw it , I had to look for the rest of the movies to understand the plot . And I haven't felt sorry . It's their best movie so far . For two hours and a half you'll see continuous action with breathtaking CGIs . No wonder they gained more than 2 billions worldwide . I have one messages for the morons giving one or two stars : go and see the other movies to understand this one , mthfks !!! Don't write a bad review just because you don't understand it .", "Without going in to spoilers, let it suffice to say that all the bad stuff that happens in this movie is caused by the repeating stupidity and selfishness of the main cast. Every marvel movie requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but in their latest with they had to drastically decrease the intelligence of all good guys to make it a 'fair' match for the bed gay (singular). There was no other way to work such a big cast probably. The main redeeming factor is the extremely well done interaction between characters from different franchises and the jokes by themselves make the movie worth watching, just don't except anything from the story.", "Good movie but at the end it's a popcorn movie I can't imagine it's among the top 10 movie of all time ... It's pure CGI and Visual effects how this can be with Godfather, Goodfellas, Fight Club ...etc.", "I guess I didn't really know what to expect from Infinity War but like everyone else I was stoked to see it. I must be getting tired of the Marvel Universe because I thought this movie was very mediocre. I didn't get what they were trying to do with Thanos and the kind of ridiculous ending. After the extra post credit stuff I kind of left the theater with an \"Do I really care anymore.\" I kind of got the feeling that the rest of the silent audience were either confused, stunned or didn't care either.", "I feel like I just gave birth to a Thanos-sized baby. I have been physically and emotionally drained by this movie from start to finish, as it starts with an intense sense of foreboding, and carries that throughout the entire rest of the film. This is edge-of-your-seat excitement, and it is not hyperbole to say so. Around every corner is something dangerous and unpredictable, and for all the scenes that feature so many of the heroes Marvel has cultivated over the last decade, it never feels cluttered. The Russos carefully pace the introductions and the separation of scenes, never feeling like our stay with a certain group of heroes is too long or too short. We have come a long way to get here, and in doing so, we are not cheated in any way by how the story unfolds. Josh Brolin's Thanos is the real star of the movie. A background villain, ever looming in the shadows and on the horizon, he finally gets his moment, and garners ample screen time and development, unlike so many villains before him. His motives are laid out in an expert sort of way, much like Killmonger's in Black Panther, and it creates a richer experience. Thanos relies on Brolin's capabilities as an actor to become real, and Brolin is more than up to the challenge. The visuals on Thanos are remarkable as well; every subtle facial tick and reaction is intensely detailed, and incredibly realistic. That sort of skill elevates the product as a whole, immersing the audience in its world seamlessly. And then there's that ending. Oh, we must talk about that ending. There have been none like it, and the reactions in the theater when you see it will be unlike any you've ever had in a Marvel movie before. The Russos took some big chances, brought together the universe that so many before them have built, and blasted the whole thing into space for one two and-a-half hour thrill ride, with another installment to come. Is it May 2019 yet?", "This movie is a very long series of special effects bonanzas / fights and THAT'S IT. It has no purpose - virtually no plot - is endlessly frustrating and at the end feels like you have been promised a trip to Disney World - and you get all excited ( by the marketing / trailers etc . . ) and so you drive for several hours and along the way people in your Car keep being killed in front of you and thrown out of the Car - and right at the end of the trip someone throws YOU out of the Car onto a long desolate road and drives off. SERIOUSLY. That is what watching this incredibly over hyped movie is all about. The VACUUM of EMPTINESS.", "-Unengaging rushed story/poorly developed/everything happens too quick in the start -Doesn't show what the soul stone does -Thanos is the epitome of a pretentious villain. He is severely underdeveloped. Killing half of populations didn't make enough sense. Why not give him a better reason for him to do what he's doing? Or explain how overpopulation kills civilizations? A really poor follow up to a great villain that was Killmonger -Any future plot to destroy the world or universe in a future marvel movie would make no sense at all because in theory Thanos saved the universe in the long run -It really messes with Thor Ragnarok's story. Every Asgardian dies and no one is saved at the end of that movie and apparently Thor is actually useless without his hammer. His arc in this movie is a complete reversal of his arc in the previous movie. A lot of dedicated Marvel fans would be annoyed watching these two movies back to back -Thor's whole story was really boring and slow and had no weight -No arcs for characters that should have arcs which is most characters -A lot of cool characters, Hulk, Drax turned into comic relief characters -With weak story and too much action (though the action was mostly great), the action just becomes a headache after a while -Sacrificing... It's very confusing that the heroes who choose friends over stones get punished. Then those who choose to sacrifice their friends (Wanda and Star-Lord) still get punished. So no matter what choice the Avengers make, the movie still decides to punish them. Yet Thanos makes a sacrifice of his own and wins. So the whole story is summarized to ''The Avengers lose because the writers made them lose'' -Too much to be resolved in the next movie Everything good with infinity war: -Cap's first appearance -Ending gave me chills", "Worst Avengers movie so far. The first one was kind of cool. Enough said.", "First of all I am a marvel fan. I must say Avengers infinity war was a good movie not a great movie. To me it was on par with justice league and that's saying a lot. Yes it was darker than the marvel movies that came before killing off some marvel characters but it's obvious that most of these characters would be back because they have scheduled movies for next year. \nThanos strength was very inconsistent after an opening scene where he kills Loki and make light work of the hulk without the infinity stones he then struggle to beat iron man and even captain America lived after an encounter with him when he had most of the infinity stones.\nAlso thanos goones came for vision who at the time was with scarlet witch. Both from previous movies are powerful characters but thanos goones makes light weight of them and if it wasn't for captain America black widow and falcon who all are human possessing no actual power but they were able to beat the goones it was really mind numbing. \nIf you really analyze it you would realize that there is an agenda here to just mindlessly praise everything marvel does while being overly critical of DC. Both movies were ...meh \nI honestly don't see why everyone became so brainless to just give this movie a 10 or 9 as if it was the best movie ever created when it was just in the same vein as justice league but much more super hero's who at times get overlooked or does nothing.", "This 2 hour and 29 minute movie of pure marvel was the best movie I've seen in a while! From Tony Stark/Iron Man's nanotech suit, to Thanos being the all powerful destroyer of worlds, to the AMAZING fight scene in Wakanda (especially when Thor entered in) all the way to the end... words just don't describe this movie.", "It is a well balanced movie. Best Marvel movie in the whole franchise. It has a cohesive plot and flow. Thanos War is an apt title as this movie focuses on the villain more then the 20 or so superheroes enlisted to fight him. You get to see the world from thanos's eyes. A different perspective which is what makes it different and better. If you waited for an epic Thanos movie you have got it.  Thanos gets fully fleshed out and his motives and desires become clear. It shows what he is prepared to lose in order to gain his goals. He is the only decent villain to come from marvel and rightfully so as the stakes are never higher. There is plenty of action and it isn't just mindless fighting.  There are only some flaws but you forget them cause the movie is good.", "I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to supply a balanced, insightful critique of this film because I'm still struggling to make any sense of it. For it's torturous length I witnessed hundreds of explosions, hundreds of humans / supposed superheroes being tossed huge distances and then getting up again to fight another day, an adolescent spider kid who refused to take advice from his elders and betters and other nonsense.\nBut the major thing for me was the NOISE. Relentlessly loud 'dramatic ' music, relentlessly loud banging and crashing, relentlessly loud dialogue... oh no.. wait... my bad. Relentlessly whispered dialogue that I couldn't make head or tail of, even while directing my lipreading skills.Sorry Avengers production team but if you want people to enjoy a film, make sure the punters can hear whats being said. Thanks .", "Lotsa mashup of various Marvel movies with no additional character development that adds to the story. Is the viewer expected to know all those movies? The villian is cool, but too shallow. No character conflicts, no real depth there. The story sorta suggests that he kinda intends it for the good of the overall. Yet all he seems to do is to intend to kill half of the population even when he has all them stones and does not spend a second to wonder if their power could be used for some contructive purposes that does not involve random killings. Even the villians in mission impossible movies have much more depth. On the plus side... Thor had pretty funny dialogues and otherwise I would have given a lower score..Clearly, excellent CGI. DrB", "Infinity War is everything it claims to be and more. The creators of the Marvel franchise have done it again with this new film. The perfect blend of action, drama, comedy, and romance. A culmination of almost every film genre out there. A perfect climax to all the Marvel films thus far. Its safe to say that anyone who has seen this movie will definitely be tuning in for the next one.", "My wife usually sleeps through movies at the theater, sort of my own geiger counter for boring with snores instead of clicks. More popcorn for me so I'm ok with it but this movie had so many long drawn out parts that I was bored. I guess part of the problem is so many stars in each scene, they all need screen time, all need important lines, so if something is going on like say ... trying to take a glove off Thanos there's a bunch of characters who've been in other movies that have endeared them to audiences that the scene takes a very long time. Most people liked mantis, and the new spiderman is perfect, ironman is awesome as always ... the list goes on. It took them ten minutes trying to take the dudes glove off !! Who takes ten minutes to take a glove off ??! I mean yes before Going to the movie one of us took about ten minutes trying on different shoes but Come On it's a Glove !! And the dude's almost asleep strap a rocket to it (you did this to gamora) push a button and it comes off. So much of this movie was like that, long drawn out scenes of looking ... thinking ... brooding ... they could have taken an hour off this movie and not lost any content. And speaking of lack of content, there was almost no hulk in this, he was in it for what, a minute? I think it was about one minute, yes I like ruffalo but when I was a kid I didn't watch the show for bixby, it was to see ferrigno. The only redeeming quality, my favorite part was Peter Dinklage. My second favorite character in the game of thrones world and they made him a Giant. Awesome. I might rent this, only because I can fast forward a lot of this but I will not buy it, and I have a bunch of marvel movies on my shelf.", "This movie is full of too many characters so you hardly get to enjoy anybody! This is nothing but the worlds longest preview for the next film. Don't waste your time. Watch it right before the next one and save yourself time, energy, and torture.", "I don't usually write reviews but after I saw this I knew I had to. This movie had a great combination of action, story, and it's fair amount of tears throughout. I feel like if you're going to see this see it in the theater with your friends not by yourself. You'll need someone to talk to after the movie.", "Leading into infinity war, not much is known about Thano's true character. However this is introduced within seconds of the films start. Putting the power and will of Thanos into light, the Asgardian ship is destroyed along with most of its occupants. This kicks off the \"heist\" of the stones apart from the first one.", "A film that exhilarates and cheats you at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes. Sure, non-stop action with all your favorite heroes and foes, yet an overly fast paced plot leaves only the outstanding SFX to remember when you feel cheated by the ending, and knowing you have to wait another year to close-out the mystery. So until then, you have to jump to your own conclusions. Not a fan of these type of plots. Still, exciting and well directed and acted. A generous 9/10 from me.", "Idk how it's got on the top 10 of IMDb list.\nIt's not that good.", "Same CGI villain like that Steppenwolf, but Thanos is much much more Recent marvel villains have been awesome\nLike Killmonger, Loki, Ultron, and now Thanos Not only powerful physically, but has interesting personality, and somewhat relatable\nIf you just recently watched the movie \"What Happened to Monday\" then you might even support Thanos' actions That's it about Thanos\nNow to the movie itself It lived to the hype\nNot in the way that people predicted, but the epicness most likely satisfy everyone\nNot gonna spoil, go watch it\nThough I'm sure most of you have gotten the ticket already lol~", "I thought there will be a better ending. Very shocked by the ending not much of a story as well", "Seriously. I now know the meaning of having your jaw drop. I have never seen anything like this. This deserves honor and praise.", "Terrible movie, way too dark. We go to superhero movies to feel good and escape our real lives. Not a single feel good moment in the whole 2 and a half hours. One liners? Maybe a half hearted chuckle. I was super excited for this movie and extremely disappointed. Marvel lost a rabid fan.", "It was very badly written. I just got out of the hall after the interval it was so bad lol!", "The movie failed to deliver he excitement and the entertainment that other marvel movies managed to do ,i guess gathering all the characters was a major fallacy within this movie, thanos's performance was a CGI made one didn't feel the malevolence and in his acting at all so much like steppenwolf they should've dwelled in his performance and emerge a new villain that will dominate the scenes, again they should've simultaneously put the superheroes and the villains alike in order to create balance in the plot nevertheless the movie was simply enjoyable but didn't deserve the hype he got.", "This is honestly my all time favorite movie, yeah they only show characters for a few seconds here and there but do y'all realize how many characters there are? i mean all i have to say is the jokes here and there made me laugh really hard spiderman (Tom Holland my king) had me bawling my eyes out and movies that make me feel emotionally connected to characters are my favorite kind of movies, i have said my peace, now go on with your day and have a blessed day.", "Totally basic. Generic..I would not even remember anything about this movie if it wasn't for the disappearing act at the end. Of course they'll all be back. Maybe I just have Super hero burnout.", "Love it! this is the most incredible movie I have ever seen! not only within the Marvel cinematic universe. It is the best movie ever", "So there's a trend lately with all these 1/10 reviews bashing IW, especially by saying it doesn't belong in the top 250. \nFirstly they don't understand how IMDB's rating system works, fanboyism can't get movies in the top 250. \nSecondly, and this is the funniest part, at the same time they think this movie is not better than e.g. LOTR:TTT (I don't either) they also with their 1/10 votes think IW is WORSE than The Room (3.6/10) or Britney Spears' Crossroads (3.4/10). They must think these movies are awesome compared to IW. \nGo watch some really bad movies and get some perspective.  Now for the review part. IW was really really good, a spectacle. It was so intense that it took me hours to settle down, it might even have been too much. \nWhen I have extremely high expectations it is very rare that I'm 100% satisfied, but after one viewing I had nothing important to criticize. However I always need a second viewing before having my final opinion so I'll rate this 8/10 for now but it will probably land in 9/10. \nDon't miss the opportunity to watch it in theaters, even if you don't like it, you will miss an historic movie event.", "I have been told by my friends to watch this movie , in theaters but unfortunately or FORTUNATELY, I ignored to do so and recently I watched this movie, and I was glad that I pass the plan to go for this one. I am not a BIG fan of this Franchise ,but the last installment, which I saw, Avengers- \"The Civil War\" , which had different script as compare to the other heroic movies. The Idea of fight - against each other , was not new , as we saw in Batman Vs Superman prior to Civil War, but in that movie something was missing and which results the less interest of the viewers.\nThis movie, is a very gigantic movie because of the characters and their super powers, so there's no question that kids won't like it ! They do, off course. Movie, has very different kind of emotional scenes, I can hope, they were emotional enough to make the fans cry ( Avengers' fans again). So apart from the mesmerizing script , the thing which was a bit more amusing was you don't expect , comedy from HULK, c'mon, keep the comedy for the kid - spider man , not for a guy like HULK. But from the Director has a different point of view- might be an experiment , which results in a successful attempt. So in short , it's a movie specifically for the fans of AVENGERS Franchise, not for every one. Fans & kids will love this one, as they see converting their print media into visual media.\nit's 5 on 10.", "The screen went black, the lights in the theater came up a little, and the credits began to scroll as over 100 people sat in quietly. We all sat in stunned silence staring at the screen after having witnessed the culmination of 10 years and 18 films all leading to this moment. Had Marvel pulled any punches? No. Was the hype real? Oh, yes. Is there a way out? There must be, but only the next films will determine what that 1 way in 14,600,005 is.  A few things to help you: First, is the movie hard to follow? If you haven't seen the previous 17 films in the \"franchise,\" probably a bit, if only due to the large number of main characters and their relationships to each other and the storyline in this film. Second, is there humor? Yes. Third, are there good action sequences? Hell, yes. Fourth, do main characters die? Yes, and I won't say who, how, or how many. Fifth, is Thanos a good villain? Yes, a very good villain whose story you learn throughout the film and whose motives are clear, if not crazy. Sixth, is there an after credits scene? Yes, one, at the very end of the credits, followed by an on screen statement. Seventh, would I want to see this film more than once? I know I do, if only to spot the tie ins to previous films that I didn't catch the first time.  Eighth, is the film emotionally draining? Yes, if you have seen the previous films and have any attachment to the characters in those films, you may be disturbed at the way this film leaves off.", "To all you fans of the film, and others I may offend, please understand, this review is not about taking down your childhood/memorable ties to the superheroes, it's really just an honest review. That said, I too am a fan of comics and superheroes (Marvel/DC included. I walked into the theater with no knowledge of spoilers and the internet hype, no expectations, (yes, if you turn off your internet you will notice how many people don't care about how great the movie was) and I walked out a few minutes ago feeling the same as I did for the last marvel movie and the one before that and so on. To anyone who watches movies (acclaimed ones, not the popular merchandise selling, trilogy/series expanding films out there), it is easy to notice the studio laying ground work in the film for resurrecting all the heroes it just killed, because lets face it, no one is giving up the rights to spider-man or 'nick-fury' till the fad of superheroes is taken over by the next generation of media (or till Samuel Jackson hits 76 and they make a 'Logan' film for him). It was kind of a popular yet shameful move they used where they split the film in two (a 3 hr movie would never sell as much as 2 highly awaited 2 hour films with filler'awkward' jokes and pip culture references). A corny 'I love my daughter Gamora so much that I have to kill her' scene to add a little back story to the otherwise bland antagonist, and many such ridiculous gimmicks forced into the film to facilitate all the superheros did not make the experience any better. CGI was good, but nothing better than an average 3-D film nowadays. Music was by Skywalker sounds. and is easily relate-able to 15+ Lucas films movies (and Rubber-band Man because recycling old catchy music we all subconsciously listened to as kids is something the guardians producers like to do. Maybe it would bring out nostalgia if you are older than 22).  honestly. this film doesn't deserve the rating fans are giving it and no doubt, it will die out in a while, so I suggest those of you who are planning on watching it, go now so you can judge for yourself before your neighbor decides how great the film is for you or before the hype dies out and nobody cares. Oh yeah, most importantly, human superheros can now breathe in space without any gear because the millions of dollars they spend on paying the actors goes to waste if under a space suit.  If you have made up your mind to wait anxiously for the next few films and don't like this review, don't waste your energy hating people like me, go do something productive. If you haven't yet watched the film, go watch it with a fan. You'll be entertained, no doubt.", "Some parts of this movie are absolutely deep, touching, and well done. Thanos' sacrifice of Gamora, along with the haunting of his consciousness afterwards, makes for real villain character depth, a rare feat in superhero films. The scenes in general featuring the GOTG were stellar in my opinion. This film truly had many charming moments. That said, the movie was very unsatisfying and had me leaving the theater with countless questions. Why did Loki go down so easily? Loki's \"betrayal\" was amateurish, surely he didn't expect to actually be able to stab Thanos only seconds after pledging allegiance to him. Also, Loki has prior experience with the Tesseract, why didn't he teleport him and the other Asgardians to a safer place? What happened to Valkyrie and Korg? And why was the ending of Thor: Ragnarok completely nullified with the genocide of the Asgardians? How did Iron Man stand a chance of fighting Thanos when Hulk succumbed to him within a few punches? Why was Bruce later throughout the film unable to turn into Hulk? Ignoring Strange's \"I only saw one good outcome\" nonsense, why didn't he use the Time Stone when on Titan? The Time Stone is capable of stopping time and thus freezing whoever you want to, surely this could've been used against Thanos instead of Strange doing nothing more with the Eye than acting as if he was wearing a peridot necklace. Why didn't Thanos eliminate all threats to him as soon as he attained the Soul Stone? If I understand correctly, the Soul Stone would give him the ability to snap his fingers and kill specifically whoever he wanted, not just randomly selected people. And why was Scarlet able to destroy the Mind Stone? The Stones are primordial objects, it makes no sense for something that was exposed to a Stone's effects to have the ability to destroy an actual Stone. Also, just the fact that the Soul and Time Stones exist makes me more apathetic to the events during the film, as they are not permanent. All of these points I've brought up are why I can't give A:IW more than a 5/10.", "Non stop action but I was disappointed when they used the lords name in vain", "There are too many heroes that we get nothing from because we are expected to already like them, but the opposite is now true now none of the heroes matter, they get no character moments it's all in the service of the big epic plot thus making the villain the only likable character and thus the hero of the story and he wins, which is quite satisfying as all the heroes are all bland and boring. Just because the characters are already established is not a good reason to just stop making your characters interesting. the first iron man was good and he was likable, but the second movie had a forgettable villain with dumb powers. The second sequel (the third iron man) tries to fix the bad villain issue, but just tricks everyone for a lame surprise villain who hates iron man because he wasn't nice to him once or something. Much is the same with all the other superhero movies, except Thor all his movies suck. Ant man and black panther just rip off the plot of the first iron man by having an evil version of the hero fight him at the end and they both suck and just feel like bad copies. By the time this movie rolls around there are no really likable characters except Thanos. And they give the hero of the story his ending where he kills all the dumb unlikable characters, but then take it away in the next movie and have the villains win, which on the whole is much less satisfying and an insult to the comics these movies were based on.", "Positives:\n Negatives:\n", "Seriously! There are so many plot fails. For example when Thanos is battling Iron Man why not just turn all his missiles into bubbles like you did with Quill's gun? Everyone wants to save everyone and in the end they lose most of them. Awesome! They got exactly what they deserved. They say they want to stop trillions from dying but then make stupid decisions. Loki what the heck. Let's just hand over the tesseract. You barely care for anyone anyway, so why get mushy now. Gamora should have committed suicide before her sister was tortured. She wanted to die anyway. Gamora should have let her sister die rather than just handing over the location. They almost get the glove off and Quill goes all stupid and punches Thanos. Yes, the world is about to end so let's do stupid stuff. Thank heavens he dies. Dr. Strange should have let Iron Man die but would rather let millions die. Good choice. And then he dies. Vision wanted to die but no one would destroy the stone. He dies anyway. Twice actually. It's brilliant. All these smart people doing stupid stuff. You can't even explain their behavior by pulling the \"morally right\" card because there are only a couple heroes that fit that bill. Watch the movie for the special effects because there isn't much plot to speak of.", "Most Over-rated movie of All time. Why? So, first of all, this is my Opinion Spec Effects was nothing special, sound-track was nothing special. There was too much characters in it (i know you have to finish 20 average movies marathon, so you at least know what is what) But the biggest problem is \"the Strategy\". You have like 20+ Heroes with unique powers and technology. So i assumed that they'll think it out how to defeat Thanos by using it. But no, the only \"strategy\" was to do everything to take his glove off... OR \"What's our plan?\" \"just kick his ass\" so basically, you throw everything at him, and see if something comes out of it... That was bad. And CGI army... WHY? why you need army if you can beat them all by yourself... Doesn't make sense for me. Everything is going on, jumping from 1 place to another, it's hard to follow if you are not a hardcore fan of MCU. Personally it's too much going on. Can we just go back to Actual 1v1 action instead of relying on CGI armies?", "You know when you go on a rollercoaster ride with one of your parents? And, bless them for coming along, but they always complain afterwards that they feel sick, their back hurts and that they're just glad it's finally over? That's the reaction I had to this one folks.\nWith so many name characters having to have a slow pan, tilt up to face reveal shot before doing anything all the way through this film I was getting deja vu about one third of the way through the film, only to find the rest of it had to be so fast paced in order to keep all of those plates spinning at once, that your eyes and brain never get a chance to rest. For most of the movie all that's really happening at any one point is \"Remember these two guys? Let's have them meet for the first time. And now we'll cut to a fight between them and another band of generic villains\".\nThat doesn't make for a bad movie, but that can summarise what happens in this film roughly 4 or 5 different times, and unfortunately the break-neck pacing idea seems to have caught on because after seeing this movie I've noticed almost every other new film I've watched since try to do the same race through their story beats that more often than not leaves me tired.\nI don't know, I've never been a huge fan of the Marvel Movie Machine, it's definitely had a handful of great films amongst it's wide variety of mostly pretty good ones, but this definitely falls into that second category - worth seeing if you're into these movies, but I'm definitely not going to sit through the whole thing again.", "Avengers 3 is a cinematic masterpiece. You can call it the \"Star Wars\" of the new generation.\nEverybody, who is starring in this movie gives a wonderful performance. The movie is so good, that it is impossible to be not entertained. Avengers 3 is the best superhero movie ever. The only superhero movie, that can top this, is maybe Avengers 4. -PERFECT, (INFINITE) CHARACTERS\nEvery character is fully developed. Every character, who was build up until now, carries more weight in this movie.\nThe communication between our favourite characters is displayed in a special way. -PERFECT CGI\nI really liked the CGI. The CGI was better used than in other superhero movies today. Thanos really looked like a realistic alien. Even though some people called his animation low-budget, i think that Thanos looks great. -A PERFECT VILLAIN\nThis is the best villain ever in a Marvel Cinematic Universe-Movie ever. He has great motivations. He does not just want to eliminate people, because he wants to. He has reasons behind this. Of course, he is radical and has a wrong view on things, but there were some moments, where i empathized with him. -PERFECT, ENTERTAINING STORYLINE\nEvery little bit of this movie is entertaining. You can watch it more than a thousand times and you can not get bored. All in all: A PERFECT MOVIE \"This movie, I like it! ANOTHER!\" - Me after watching it", "Starting to watch the MCU 10 years ago just waiting to see all of the heroes of this terrific world combined together in a 2 and a half ours Masterpiece fighting the mighty titan is like the one thing you can peacfully die after .. though there is much intense interest for what's to come", "Marvels superhero movies are getting sillier and sillier, and this is by far the silliest of them all so far. Embarrasing really and rock solid proof some of todays movies and entertainment media (including tv shows) are dumbing so-called humans down... alot. Because you really have to be dumb as a coconut to enjoy this smack-everyone-in-the-face fest with over-the-top powerful superheroes trying to save half of all life in the universe, which btw they fail miserably with. This failing goes on throughout the entire movie and constitutes its single redeeming quality. I am a bit bummed out that all life in the omniverse wasn't ended by Thanos because that would actually been great news when it would have raised mankinds average IQ by 15 points during the next upcoming 5 years because of the total lack of upcoming new Marvel movies.", "I came into this movie ready to be disappointed because I heard all of the spoilers. I ended up being more disappointed than I ever could have expected. The movie is so over saturated that characters become useless to the \"plot\". I say \"plot\" because it's so paper thin that you can barely even call it a plot. Everyone in this movie seems to have been dumbed down to an incredibly low level. I felt my brain actually turning to goo due to the lack of sense in this film. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this. Thank you local library. I give it a 4/10 only for the nice CGI and maybe 1 or 2 moderately funny jokes.", "I'll keep it simple, I expected more and got less. All the other Avenger movies were a complete movie. They had a plot, a war, and won. This was not that. This was a part 1. And none of the ads mentioned it was a part 1. My expectations were dashed.  It was too much and much too inconsistent. Battles that should have been won were not for stupid reasons. I started to cheer and then had this WTF happened?  It's worth watching, but, well... just but...", "While there were nearly no plot holes, the explanations were sometimes forgettable, which is why a lot of people don't understand the MCU. It is like learning a new language similar to english, as an english speaker: it isn't always understandable. 18 movies led up to this one? the characters were 1-dimensional enough to have the movie fail to stand on it's own.

Couldn't doctor strange have created a portal when stark locked thanos's hand open?, then thanos might not be able to use the space stone and closing the portal would make thanos lose his hand.

I'm not a fan of Marvel or really just superhero films in general but this was entertaining and even somewhat risky in some aspects.  It doesn't really do anything exceptional, and there really isn't a protagonist or 3 act structure since this is more of an event rather than a film. For what it is it's good. Not a masterpiece, doesn't deserve that high of rating on this site, but it's solid.", "I am giving five only for the very good effects and the humor inside this movie. It looks like couple of movies inside one with all marvel heroes together. The way how everything is given does not correspond to the possibilities that this kind of movie can give, Very cheap story without any serious or physical reality that any of the heroes can give. Made just for fun without scientific background of how every single heroes can act in it.  For example Dr. Strange defeated much more powerful enemy in Dr. Strange movie and here he just playing the time shifting crystal as a toy. Very bad story.", "The thing about conflict is it goes both ways, no matter how well trained we are to not lose, no matter how many battles triumphed, death and loss are never far away. This is one of my favorite sequels of all time up there with \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in my book, it's also believe it or not my favorite Avengers film (at least for now, till the next one comes out). This film really is something not just is it a big event but it's also the darkest entry in the franchise and MCU, as it is the most epic but also the most tragic. Though the film is fitting as it's takes place in the MSU's 10th Anniversary and through the years it has build itself of to this, and I'll just say it's one hell of a pay off. Characters are good each have good moments: Thor and Peter Quill/Star lord stand out for me I really felt both were at their best on an emotional basis, from what both have to endure it's interesting seeing both of them really pissed, it really drives both of them to do what must be done and you really route for them doing it. Though who also stand out are Scarlet Witch and The Vision, both characters I honestly felt we're really at their best. I really like that you get a little depth on their relationship as we see how far they have can for themselves and each other. It's really touching which is also what makes what they endure all the sadder; I honestly wanted both to somehow find a way to survive but there were no guarantees. However, the one character that stands out in the whole film and that we're all really here for is Thanos. Josh Brolin is just fantastic as Thanos, this is probably my favorite role from him; it just fit like a glove for him (no pun intended). I really love the physicality as well as emotionality of his performance, let alone voice which is spot on I actually did imagine that is what Thanos would sound like. Strangely this film is sort of his movie, he truly is the main character throughout the film. Which is cool, Thanos is one of my favorite fictional villians of all time not just is he terrifying but he's the most complex as he is three dimensional.  The most interesting thing about him is he doesn't perceive himself as a villain, he honestly feels what he is doing is right, that it's for the universe's own good as he feels by destroying a certain number of worlds that are heading toward failure, he can save several other worlds in the universe so there would be an harmonious balance. He's actually aware his actions breach ethical boundaries but to him they are necessary evils to accomplish what he sets himself out to do.  I even like seeing the emotionality to him as you see from his eyes and voice a lot of anger but also a lot of sadness, as if this guy carries an emotional weight that is as heavy and large as his size as you see this is a person that has endure more than his share of loss. Which fuels his rage as it seems he despises it more than any enemy he fights. I also like that there is a bit of this unpredictability about him, you're not always sure what he's about to do until he does it which can kind of catch you off guard. And of course, his trademark weapon The Infinity Gauntlet is just awesome, it's one of my favorite fictional weapons as that gauntlet with all the stones in place lets you weld God Like Powers. With all six stones intact, you could do just about anything you want, I won't say what you have to see for yourself to believe.  I really like the story format and the pace in it is great as it's really fast, despite how long the film actually is I honestly didn't notice the time which is a good sign. At first, it's sort of an adventure as we see things taking place in both space and earth, and it's practically a race for the stones. There is kind of a double layer suspense where on one hand your hoping the Avengers will find the stones before Thanos, but on another hand your kind of are quietly routing for Thanos to find those stones because let's face it we deep down really want to see what each of them can do. And once we see Thanos utilize those stones it doesn't disappoint, it's kind of a payoff for each and every plight. And then the film turns into you could say a war movie, in the final half it gets into one of my favorite battles of all time let alone one of the longest as it clocks in about 30-40 mins. It is just absolute pandemonium as we see left, right up and down there are actually two different battles taking place. One in space with Thanos and a group of Avengers and another on earth against Thanos's forces and the secondary group of Avengers. It's almost like seeing a live action \"Where Waldo\" art illustration as there are just things happening all around the characters and you've got just most of the character from the Marvel Verse involved.  In the battles there are some really cool moments from Thor getting his new hammer which I'm glad, I know that in the last film \"Thor Ragnorok\" he's fully harnessed his power of lightening but it's just not the same, that hammer is his trademark and is just really cool seeing him kick ass with it. Which he does in this film and you can see from the ferocity of his actions he's really mad now. Or even Bruce Banner in that Hulk Buster, I thought it was really cool for once seeing Bruce doing the ass kicking and not relying on the Hulk all the time, it just shows he's no wimp Bruce truly can hold his own against danger. But I like that you see the battle isn't one sided, it really looks like things can go either way. We see the Avengers kicking ass as usual but also, we see Thanos and his forces at times get the upper hand and turn things around. Times like that really made me worried for the lives of the characters, despite the Avengers abilities they're not bullet or knife proof. You really get that wavering feeling you have where at times you feel a glimmer of hope but then gets crushed, you can say by Thanos fist. The score by one of my favorite composers Alvin Sivelstri is good, though it's really the end theme song that is the most memorable and is probably one of my favorite end themes ever. I won't say what kind of theme it is, but I'll just say just like what happens at the end it will hit you really hard. From here I've said enough, and I'll just say one last thing, a battle may be won but the war is far from over. Rating: 4 stars", "Depressing movie for the mid-thirties who already depressed from work and life and was expecting restriction of the hope in his heart that good still can beat the evil at least in a movie but I found that finally, evil after working hard has beaten good and killed half of the universe.\nWOW!\nthat is more realistic than life!\na big chin Nazi Hitler retired in peace after killing half of the universe. what is better than that for a weekend!", "10/10, iron you are superb.

Perfection!!", "Through the lack of a consistent base thread and also completely devoid of character development, Avengers Infinity War is guaranteed to leave a bitter taste in anyone who values life and purpose mouths as they leave the franchise forever. I suppose the meaning of \"infinity\" would indicate the time until anyone would again read or watch anything by Marvel.  The only remaining thought would be, \"is there a way to unwatch this?\"", "I'm not a big \"fan\" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Just wanted to get that out of the way right here and now before people begin to question my allegiance or my bias of where I stand before I start this review. As I have told many people, I do not blindly follow this series of films wherever they may go. I enjoy Marvel when they make GOOD films, just as I would any other studio, director, writer, etc. In some cases, I find the MCU films to feel almost \"cookie-cutter\" when they are at their worst. The acting is fine, the action is fine, cinematography is typically 'safe' and doesn't break new ground as often as a series of this magnitude really should. No real risks are taken. I think of 'safe' when I think of many of their films, which isn't BAD, per-say, but I wish these films would be more risky in how they handle their material. Try something new...Trying something daring...Try something DIFFERENT... Well. My wishes were granted. In spades. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not a perfect film. In fact, it's not even the best film in the MCU. However, it was absolutely EVERYTHING it was billing itself to be. It IS new. It IS daring. It IS different.  But let's un-pack that before I lose myself here. Because there's certainly A LOT to talk about...in NO SPOILER terms ;) The tone of this film, without giving anything major away, is by far the bleakest of any of these films have dared to go. This storyline and these characters that they have been teasing for 10 years are now paying-off massively, as we are now seeing real consequence in this world that has been established. Your favorite characters are here, yes, but they ARE at-risk against a threat that isn't treated lightly. There isn't any awful Yo Mama jokes like in TLJ to dilute the drama and tone.  This is DARK, and the Russo Brothers do not let you off of that ride for you or the childrens' comfort level, which is precisely what I think this part of the story needed. The many comparisons I have seen to 'Empire Strikes Back' are not invalid, as its tone, manner, and even themes are extremely similar in more ways than one.  I can tell the Russo Brothers, fresh off of 'Winter Soldier' and 'Civil War', were allowed to make a film that resembles their film, and not a studio mandate. They make decisions that I KNOW will be extremely unpopular with a lot of people, but unlike a certain franchise tentpole, this film does it without self-destructing the reason we come for these films, which is intrinsically the characters and this massive, sprawling story. Let's move on to that topic, The Characters. By far the strongest bone in this film's body is the characters and character interaction, as most Marvel films seem to excel at. After 10 years, we see all of these characters we've grown to love come-together and interact, and my goodness is it everything we have been waiting for. The dialogue here is sharp when it needs to be witty, is slow when we reach the emotional valleys, it can even reach heartwarming and heartbreaking at some points depending on what connection you have forged with these characters over the last few years. A character I find particularly captivating in this film, however, is the antagonist itself. Thanos, believe it or not, is an extremely interesting character once we see him and learn what he's all about and capable of. This isn't another case of \"big bad Marvel bad guy man\". He is genuinely a character I find fascinating, which shows Marvel took notes as far as I'm concerned. If anyone's fear was that they would get him wrong after 6 years of building him up, consider those fears squashed. This is a Marvel VILLAIN, and I mean that in the best way possible. To combine both prior points, hats off to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for managing to juggle all of these characters and such a massive story and manage to make it COHERENT. Under many other writers' watches, this likely would have been A MESS, but the way the story progressed and characters were incorporated was, for the most part, expertly done. Every character gets a moment of their own, the ones we truly care for get integral arcs over the film's massive run-time, and in the end we hardly feel that certain characters were left out of the proceedings. I wondered how they would manage all of these characters, and they managed to walk the tightrope without falling. The score is also a welcome and noticeable addition, as the talents of composer Alan Silvestri ('Back to the Future', 'The Avengers', 'Predator') were brought back for this film. There are plenty of excellent pieces of music in the film, along with the Avengers theme itself (The only noticeable orchestral pieces these films really has ever had), and it is welcome to have excellent music in these films again after the disaster Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman presented to us in 'Age of Ultron'. The music only adds to the feel of the film, which is what good movie music should rightfully do. Now, all of this considered, this film is NOT perfect. In fact, a couple glaring flaws made themselves apparent throughout the film, though they were moreso \"Tiny cracks\" than \"Gaping holes\", so to speak. For starters, the action cinematography is actually shockingly bad in the early half of the film. At some points, I could barely tell what was even supposed to be happening. The fights in the early part of the film suffer from SCS, or should I say \"Shaky Cam Syndrome\", as we are over-stimulated and shown too much CG in these portions to process what we're supposed to be looking at. That said, the action cinematography does improve as the film moves along, so this isn't a problem that knocks-out the foundations of the film. However, the action early on is NOTICEABLY bad, which certainly hurts. Editing at times was also rather choppy, as odd choices are made in some portions of the film that made me scratch my head. I can't name anything in particular, though most of my issues with the editing stemmed from odd transitions and segues that almost looked like \"abandoned transitions\", where an attempt was seemingly made to stitch two scenes together...and then proceeded to be hacked-and-slashed to trim 2 seconds off the run-time, for some odd reason.  And that's perhaps my only real issue with this film; the flow of the film. So much of it feels as if it's begging to be smoother, but instead there are sequences where it simply feels too long or too short in places. At some points, we will be on a plot thread, cut-away from it, and will not return to said thread until 20-25 minutes later. I genuinely feel that this sort of thing could have been fixed with a better editor, or simply a smoother-written story, though considering how already miraculous it is that this film managed to be coherent with how much it had to juggle, perhaps the odder pacing was only a by-product of trying to assemble all of this together. But in the end, is this massive assemblage of Marvel films and characters a success? Is this the film that is worth all the hype of 10 years and an entire film franchise has been leading up to? Yes. 'Infinity War' is a tremendously fun time at the cinemas. It is quite literally an 'Epic', sprawling across so many characters, universes, worlds, tones, etc. This film feels like an event, which it may very well be, and I can safely say the Russo Brothers and writers Markus and McFeely as well pulled off a miracle and made such a Herculean task of a film into something I think is a great summer blockbuster and a tremendous first part of what is sure to be a grand finale for this universe we've seen grow over a decade. I may not be a huge Marvel fan, but this is certainly a GOOD film. In fact, I'd dare say a GREAT one.", "A truly disappointing cinema viewing. This was hyped to be the big movie of the year but was flawed in too many ways.\nI've had some hours to think how it was a disappointment and thing these are the key ones for me.\nThe difference in humour and relism between GoTG and the earth characters became so obvious, it make much of the movie feel unreal.\nIt became obvious from an early stage that the time stone would be used and at some point lots of killed characters will come back in due course, this obvious plot line meant there was no feeling of meaning to the story.\nThe sheer number of characters running and punching on screen and a serious lack of meaningful dialogue made it hard to invest in the storyline or the interactions on screen. In fact thanos became the most likabile character during the movie as he had the best lines and most development\nThere were some random character decisions that seemed out of place, but clearly necessary to enable plot progression so shoe horned in unexessarily. I feel that other than a few exciting moments when group members face one another etc.. it didn't work as a cohesive movie.\nI wondered how it would be improved and I think either reduce the 'pew pew' scenes or add an extra movie to expand the depth of the story.", "I was very disappointed from this movie, especially about the end..... how can you make an end like this? Seriously? What the point to make this movie of half of the people are gone? I hope the next part of this will be better otherwise i would think it's totally a waste of money!!!! The action in the avengers is always great but the rest of it is full of holes... where is valkyrie? and why most of the avengers are not powerful enough as you showed in the other movies??? Where is the power of thor? Too many questions that makes me feel disappointed about it. Please fix it!!!", "Everything has been leading up to this. Infinity War's biggest challenge was somehow juggling dozens of characters coherently without making the entire narrative spread out too far, and it succeeded. Every character gets a respectable amount of screen time that they deserve without any of them feeling like cameos or out of place. From Spider-Man to Black Panther each hero's intro is just as exciting as the last with each intro bringing the hero's own flavor into the movie, and this helps the film feel like the absolutely giant event that it is. It has an unbelievable amount of stakes and is probably the most serious of all Marvel movies. There's harrowing parts to the film that are small and big, but Thanos must've had a hand in writing the script because the amount of dramatic and comedic moments is perfectly balanced. The movie is far from short on good laughs. There's plenty of laugh out loud moments that don't seep into other parts of movie and ruin some powerful serious moments, which Marvel movies have struggled with in the past. And the powerful moments are POWERFUL. They range from happiness, excitement, sorrow, shock, and sadness. They hit you so hard that after the movie it's as if you're suffering from shellshock. \n Thanos as a villain is phenomenal. Down to his motivations and his CGI he felt like a real person, and not just a one dimensional evil for the sake of evil villain. He's driven, he's dangerous, and interesting. This is Thanos's story, this is his movie. His unique power set given to him by the infinity gauntlet is used as well it can be used. One of the inherent problems with a villain who can basically do anything is that makes you ask \"Why doesn't he do that every time?\". The film deals with that very admirably to the point where that question is actually answered... most of the time. And Thanos's Black Order are quite dangerous themselves. They feel so lethal that you consider that they can each best multiple Avengers in combat single handedly. Despite the intense saturation of characters and villain who can do anything, the film is actually quite well written in the sense that there is no bad, cringy, or overdone lines. Which is hard to avoid in a big movie that is half the time spent in space. The narrative itself is executed exceptionally. It's really well structured. It feels like one continuous story and not a jumbled mess. It almost feels like it's told in chapters similarly to Pulp Fiction, at least in the first half. Like many of the other characters, the original Avengers Theme(which is a character in itself) also makes an epic return throughout the film. Enhancing the intensity of the story's biggest moments, while evoking goosebumps, nostalgia, and even tears. \n When it comes to the films faults they're little and minor. There's a few laughs that are indeed funny but are drawn out a little too long, causing the joke to overstay it's welcome. And during the second act the movie drags a little, but it only might do so because of the great anticipation of how the film will end, and that anticipation may compel you to grow a little impatient. But it's not fully a fault in the film itself. There's some actions that the ability of being able to perform those actions are muddled or left unexplained, maybe I might've missed the explanations, but it took me out of the movie slightly when it came up. What didn't take me out of the movie was the CGI. One of the main problems with Black Panther was the overuse of CGI in the film, but T'Challa's suit is a nice real looking practical suit that looks great. Again Thanos's visual effects are some of the best ever, and never did the thought of green screen or brief rubbery replacements of characters cross my mind. Overall, the colossal event of Infinity War successfully handles a large plethora of characters while leaving more than enough room for exhilaration, emotion, and consequence that is abundantly present in this film much more than the films that came before it. So I give it an 8.8", "No plot, lots of bangs, confusing, full of cliches. What else can I say?", "The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him. It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it. The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development. I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a \"needs of the many\" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways.  Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.", "This film was not at all what I expected or hoped for out of Infinity War. By no means was it a bad film or undeserving of praise, but there were details that could have been executed better. The plot, though it came with a few surprises, was ultimately rather repetitive and could have taken place in a much shorter span, leaving time for more character development (which was lacking) and a chance for our mightiest heroes to truly team together and fight Thanos-what I think we were all expecting out of this culmination of ten years of the MCU. Additionally, it isn't much of a cliffhanger if every we know that the majority of the characters who \"died\" are coming back for later films, and it only saves us temporary grief. Although this is personal preference, it could also have been darker. I love humor as much as the next film-goer, but at some point there has to be a line. As previously stated, this is the culmination of ten years' worth of films building up to this moment, and I spent most of it laughing rather than crying, as did many of my companions.\nNone of this is to say it was a bad film. It was much-anticipated, and there were moments that broke my heart. I was on the edge of my seat for a good portion of those two-and-a-half hours, and for good reason. The scoring brought tears to my eyes more than once. It was a good film. But I expected more from Marvel.", "As a grown man I am not ashamed to say that I think I had tears in my eyes more than not. Whether it was from sadness or pure joy. To not give any spoilers I will say that there is an entrance that Thor makes that for some reason made me cry and laugh at how amazing it felt to see. It was truly awe inspiring. When Thanos first appears on screen my heart skipped a beat as I realized that it is finally here. Though two guys behind me wouldn't shut up and I had to tell them to do so during the credits when they were the only ones talking. I at one point heard one of them crying while saying through the sobs \"I love this movie so much.\" This movie experience made me feel connected, even to a person I would normally not care for, due to the commentary he and his friend provided before and after the movie, and the random laughs and comments throughout which were more than audible. I felt shear panic, sadness, and joy all at once the entire movie. I am a big movie lover, I comb IMDb constantly for trailers, trivia, and any news I can find. When everyone else opens Facebook, or Twitter every morning in the bathroom, I open IMDb. I am obsessed with movies and the experience of seeing one in theatres for the first time. I can truly say that this was the best movie experience of my life. It wasn't until a couple of days later that I realized that Avangers 4 HAS to top it. I cannot imagine. Any true Marvel fan or movie lover should love this movie!!!", "Amazing! Can't wait till May 2019!! Action throughout and a brilliant ending that keep you guessing for a whole year.", "There was obviously a LOT of hype about this movie, but it actually lived up to it! I laughed, gasped, cheered, almost cried...It definitely helped to have seen the other Marvel movies for background, though. I loved that so many of the characters got together for the first time, and it was hilarious to see their first interactions, especially when they didn't know who each other were. The acting, special effects, music, emotion, action, humor and drama were all excellent! Can the sequel come out next weekend please?", "I read an article of how they approached this movie (direction, writing, etc.) and was really looking forward to it. As I watched the first 2/3, I was excited. WOW, I said, this is going to be great.  Then.... It looks like they wrote the ending to take advantage of the success of Black Panther. And the fate of the universe (which I get confused as to. is it the universe or galaxy, probably does not matter), comes down to hand to hand combat once again. Not smarts, not teamwork, but whether one party can hit hard enough to destroy the other party. Really? That is just sloppy writing.  So, here are a few questions.  1. If Wakanda is so advanced, why don't they give Black Panther outfits to everyone? Why sacrifice all your citizens? (hint: future sales).\n2. If the infinity stones are indestructible, they why not wipe the population and then take them?\n3. Why do I hope movie making will change? Oh well. Terrific cinematography. Great story (to the 2/3's mark). And great marketing. This movie will make a bunch of money, but not because it is good.", "I hated how it was all over the place, most everyone died, the hulk never transformed.", "Some people're annoyed that they got to see no introduction to their superheroes.MCU has been running for a decade through our solo superhero movies.What more introduction do you need?\nThis movie first starts from where Thor Ragnarok ended.But some people just wanted to ride the hype train so they went to see the Infinity War without a single knowledge of Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nAvengers Infinity War is amazing.Thanos and his black order perfectly lived up to their hype.Get ready to see a rejuvenated form of Dr Strange,Thor and Wanda.Whole theatre was exploding during Thor's entry in Wakanda.The humour is also perfectly executed.The Wakandans including T'Challa may have a very short role but they've still managed to make this awesome.\nIf you havent watched the movie already,trust me,this is all worth it.Enjoy it in your nearest theatre with your friends and families!", "The movie was mostly a lot of CGI and a lot more fighting. ALL neat to watch. BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that. BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe? I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous. I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun. This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE. Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable. I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that. Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE. We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him. So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: \"After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village\" Seriously that is how they did it. So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe?\nA dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream?\nOr .....? \"Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!\" Thanos: \"Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun\" This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos. Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie. . So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting. BUT ya gotta hand it to the fanboys who have posted it was the greatest cinematic effort in the history of the world. And the one guy who said anyone who says differently then IMDB should immediately pull the review and probably publicly flog the person who wrote it.", "I don't understand how this movie got so much hype, it's completely ridiculous. The time Thanos took to gather all the infinity stones (six years) he could've went to the planets and killed half of the people. He didn't even complete his mission which was to and I quote \"destroy half of ALL lif in the universe\" which was later change to creatures because they noticed he didn't do that. Their were a bunch of unnecessary scenes and scenes that didn't even make sense. This movie was all over the place and was very hard to follow. Spoiler right here---> A example of this was when he through Gamora off the cliff he shed one tear and was like whatever I now have the last soul stone, and Gamora was the only person Thanos loved and he didn't seem like he cared. The other complete ridiculous thing about this movie is the spiderman bus scene in Homecoming it didn't show he had spidey sense, and finally it was aid in the movie the stones were scatter across the universe that should've taken Thanos longer to find them. My final review 2/10 would not recommend this movie to any superhero fan. The whole movie was just a way for marvel to get money. If you want to see this method done right go to Justice League or Legends of Tomorrow.", "A common correlation I have seem with the poorly rated reviews for this movie seem to be coming from people that obviously haven't seen the previous movies. If you don't know that there weren't 31 movies before this, then you don't know marvel enough to give an accurate review. I understand if you don't know the exact number but you should know that there isn't 31. I can even understand if you don't feel like watching the previous 18 movies before coming to see this one, but then don't give a review on a movie you don't fully understand. But I can't hate on you too much, you gave this film your money so thanks for that, and thanks for keeping this great studio alive because I can't wait for what's to come!", "Expect the unexpected. As someone who tends to think the marvel films could use a more serious tone with graver consequences, this film fit it out of the park. The film is more of a thanos story and plays out as such, where he is the hero of his own tale. His goals, while extreme, are justifiable in his own mind. This, among other things you just have to see in the theater, make him one of, if not the best, comic book villain to date. I payed full price for my seat but I only used the edge.", "Thanos was incredible throughout and so impressed with how they managed to advance so many character arcs in this movie for the MCU moving forward. Thor with the guardians was so well done and something I would love to see more of. Who knew Thor would be the funniest Avenger??", "This movie is amazing, thrilling through the end and joss brolin is putting on a master performance as Thanos!", "Ever since the movie title was announced , i was super excited to see it....But this movie exceeded all my expectations. Right from the start of the film,there was not a single moment when my eyes were off the screen. The C.G.I. and 3-D effects of the movie were fantastic.You are glued to your seats for the whole run time. The comic timing was really great and some scenes were quite hilarious.The film was a mixture of action,thrill,comedy and emotions.  Thanos appears to be very powerful and in some scenes i felt emotionally connected to him as well. I believe thanos is the best villain in MCU till date.Thanks to the great acting of Josh Brolin. All the superheroes are given acceptable screen time. Action scenes are brilliant. After the end of the movie, i felt like-Why the movie has ended..The ending might disappoint some people.I will not give any spoilers here. This film deserves to be watched at IMAX. Waiting for part-II....", "What a movie .... can't explain with word... just dint want the movie to end....", "Such an epic film with so much depth and emotion. Incredible cgi, cast and story. Epic from start to finish, this film gives you the best conclusion to 10 years of mcu films and leaves you speechless by the end. Props to The Russo Brothers on making a film with so many characters work and giving us an outstanding Marvel film.", "Best awesome movie in decades ! Speechless ! Just three magical words \" thank you MARVEL \"", "The movie lives up to all the created hype and it destroys all the fan theories and predictions. Its a continuation of 18 movies and 10 years so if you havn't watched all the previous movie. Then THANOS WANTS YOU TO STAY HOME.", "I watched Avengers at Midnight on release day. I have not stopped thinking about it since. My life has been consumed in way I didn't think it could be. I thought I was stronger than that. I will be going back to see this again this week, No other film in recent memory has made even consider doing that, let alone opening up an account on a generic review site just to help expel some adrenaline. I know reviews are an opinion, but if this film isn't a 10 across the board I feel a sadness for the people who voted lower, I fear what they are searching for in life does not exist. The basically nailed it in a way that I could not imagine possible. Heck I still don't know how they got it so right! Just go and see it, then go and it again", "Avengers: Infinity War 2018  In the film, Thanos was trying to correct the universe in his mind by collecting the all-powerful infinity stones and using them to erase half of the population of the universe to put an end to hunger. In his mind, it was the only way, and he was the only one that had the will to do it. But most of the Marvel superheroes that we have come to love wanted to put a stop to him before this happens.\n The base theme of this movie and most superhero movies is responsibility. With great power comes great responsibility. Now this works both ways in this film because Thanos, the villain thinks that with his great power and the power of the infinity stones that he has the responsibility to correct the universe by taking out half of everyone. And the superheroes have the responsibility to try to stop him. \n Some of the plot points to elaborate on responsibility is when Tony Stark felt responsible enough to put something back on his chest in case the world needed him. Tony again was about to call Steve Rodgers whom they were not on talking terms because the world needed him. Steve Rodgers Felt responsibility enough to come back to the Avengers even though he was kicked out and in bad terms. War Machine felt responsible enough to ignore his orders of arresting Steve but instead welcomed him back. The black panther felt a responsibility to open his gates and help the Avengers and have his armies be in the war. \n Infinity wars tied together all of the Marvel movies that come out in the last two years and where they left off. Like Thor and his people on the spaceship on their way to Earth but instead in the beginning of infinity wars it shows them being attacked and destroyed by Thanos and his generals.\n The sound effects of when the heroes hearing the screams and cries in the background, outside there building and they took the responsibility of helping and saving these innocent bystanders by just jumping in and taking on the bad guys, Thanos's generals. \n The camera angle of zooming in on the faces of some of the heroes during great emotional times in the movie caught the moment, like when Spider-man didn't want to go and held onto Tony and cried out for him. Also when Scarlet Witch had to try to destroy the infinity stone that Vision had in his head to stop Thanos from getting it even though Scarlet Witch knew it would kill vision and she loved him.\n Overall the movie was remarkable and done very well in all aspects. I plan on watching it many many more times to catch every little detail that I might have overlooked the first time because so much happened and I CAN NOT wait until part two comes out next year.", "Oh my god. This was such a shock and better than I thought it would be, Thanos unlike Ultron or Loki (RIP sadest death I've ever seen next to Yondu) was a actual threat to the Avengers he was the embodiment of brute strength. Thanos was a very relatable villain he wanted to wipe out half of the Universe to balance it and to make sure what happened to his planet doesn't happen to anymore. Thanos also had a very good connection with Gamora in the movie Thanos seemed like a cold being who loved no one but he loved Gamora and you can see it in his eyes when he talks to her because he's very hurt by the things Gamora says to him. I really did feel for the \"mad titan\" and Thor omg first Ragnarok now this you have to stop or my head will explode with amazement. Captain America was great again but didn't have as much time to shine as Thor and Iron man did. Iron Man as usual was amazing Robert Downey jr again owns this role like no one else can with there characters he has some really emotional scenes especially the call back to Homecoming with Spider-Man fading away just like he said in Homecoming he feels like that's on him. Doctor Strange also was really great in the movie and I saw what you did there with it was the only way ;) meaning the 1 chance of beating Thanos was to give him the stone and let him \"win\". I can't wait to see what Captain Marvel will do her movie and what she will do in Avengers 4 which seems like she will have a very big role in it. There are no words to describe how spectacular this film was such an amazing movie.", "Before I proceed, let me clarify one point. I happen to see the film in Australia on the 25th and left the cinema in a rather good mood. The next day i found myself on IMDB - I'm a huge movie fan - and saw that this movie had a 9.2. A 9.2!!! Immediately I thought it was some glitch. And yet today it is 9.1.  By all means the movie was decent. Perhaps a 6/10 or 7 if you really like the marvel universe (it is one of my guilty pleasures). But stop handing out 10/10 scores as if they were pamphlets and not gold (which they should be considered). This movie was not great. It adds nothing to the realm of cinema. It was not thought provoking whatsoever. It was simple entertainment. And do not mistake me, this is what we should expect. I love mindless action and so on. It pains me to see these reviews. I have given it a 1 to counter the mindless stream of 10's being granted despite myself truly thinking the film deserves a 7/10.  To conclude, it's a fun film. But far from the greats. Far from them indeed.", "A movie that lived up above the hype, that's what I felt like after seeing this movie. I am huge fan of Russo brothers after seeing their epic Winter Soldier movie but felt disappointed with their take on Civil War (Strictly personal). So, in order to avoid the hype, I decided not to watch any tv spots that released, and that method worked btw. The movie started exactly where Thor: Ragnarok finished. As usual the movie followed the same pattern that every marvel movies does. Its loaded with a lot of fun during the battles but everything is well balanced. Each character got their own screen time. If anyone ask which character scored above all it is so hard to tell. I felt like Russo brothers managed to give the importance that each character deserves. The movie is packed with a lot of Goosebumps scenes which is enough to burst out the cinema hall. I'm not getting into the story as there is no point in explaining considering the hype but everything that a marvel fan needs is included in this movie. It took more than 10 years to see Thanos properly, but I would like to say that he just went a long way beyond my expectation. Visually the movie is top notch as we can easily identify that the studio invested a lot of money which resulted into eye popping action. Overall in my opinion THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE ever made by the studio (Previously it was Winter Soldier). The movie got only 1 post credit scene which was scheduled at the end credits.", "Ever since the massively successful experiment in shared universe building that was the original Avengers, it has felt somewhat like Marvel have been cruising along at the same level. Although there have been plenty of excellent films in the meantime, nothing has really matched the relative scope and ambition of that first Avengers film, best encapsulated by the somewhat disappointingly formulaic Age of Ultron. \nInfinity War feels like that game changer, and Marvel upping a gear, showcasing a level of ambition in terms of scope of story and characters only seen before in adaptations of epic fantasy such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, in fact several times the film put me in mind of Return of the King. In terms of what is a purely cinematic narrative (based of course on decades of comics) the sheer scale of the film is surely unique. \nDespite a run time of two hours forty minutes, the film rarely drags due to a break neck pace that never lets up, there is none of the dull opening exposition and set up that often hurts these films. On the down side, this is likely to leave those who aren't caught up on the series somewhat lost, while it is not essential to have seen every single Marvel film, it is probably important to have seen a large proportion of them.\nIt also finally feels like Marvel has overcome it 'Villain Problem', similar to the success of Michael B Jordan's character in Black Panther, Josh Brolin's Thanos is an excellent antagonist, with tangible motives and an engaging presence. \nWhat is perhaps most remarkable about the film is that, it manages its large cast so effectively, not a single moment is wasted and all major characters have their moment to shine, all thanks to the incredibly efficient pacing and stucture. \nInfinity War feels like the best film it could be. The vast scope means that it is impossible for it to quite engage on the same level as the more 'low key' solo entries in the genre, and the necessities of the fast pacing make it exhausting watching at times. Ultimately though, the film is a wild ride and emotional roller-coaster that is not to be missed for fans of the franchise.", "How to review this film without 100% spoilage?  Well, let's start with the high-jacking of the refugee ship from THOR:RAGNAROK. It comes under attack by Thanos, who manages to whup Thor and the Hulk almost too easily.  Enter the Guardians of the Galaxy and Dr. Strange. The latter aiding Iron Man and Spidey against two alien mercenaries (Roughouse and the Metal Master?). While the former rescue a comatose Thor (who now resembles a Silver Age Nick Fury minus the cigar) from outer space.   This leads to the mandatory explanation about the Infinity Stones and the various aspects of existence they control. And wouldn't you know it? The Vision has one of them in his forehead!  Enter two more alien mercs (Bloodscream and Pip the Troll?) who go after him and Wanda Maximoff in Scotland. Only to have their butts handed to them by Captain American and Company (with Cap now resembling Ringo Starr)! From Scotland, this group goes to Wakanda while Iron Man, Spidey, and Dr. Strange wind up on the Saturnian moon of Titan.  All these different story threads finally coming together in an opening battle that totally surpasses the turning point Battle of Eckthelion from LOTR: ROTK!  Marvel Studios has been building up to this moment for more than a decade. Some of their previous films, in this shared universe, have been more lackluster than blockbuster. But, this was not the case, here. I sat through every second of it and I was not disappointed! Nor was anybody else in the packed house that showed this flick, earlier tonight.  Sure, there was a cliff-hanger ending! But, I knew that there was one coming from the start. After all; there's only so much you can put into a nearly three hour-long movie with a cast of characters this big. Rest assured, though. The Good Guys will whup the Bad Guys! How? I don't know any more than you do. Personally, I hope the sequel features the cinematic debut of either Adam Warlock, Quasar, or Capt. Mar-Vell of the Kree. Yet, Marvel Studios might surprise me (and everybody else) by introducing none of those three!  Two things everyone should remember, however.  1) The Confederate Army's victory at the First Battle of Bull Run didn't guarantee them victory in the American Civil War. And...  2) This film is PG-13. Which means it \"might\" prove unsuitable for hyper-active, attention-deficit children, under the age of five, who erroneously think they're the Flash!", "I didn't mind the film, some parts of it were good and some were meh.\nWhat I enjoyed was some of the more subtle humour in it. Like other Marvel MCU films, the humour seems forced, but with this one, they have toned it down. There are still some (to me) forced humour in there however it's not too much over the top.\nThe scene where Stan Lee makes an appearance as the school bus driver is funny...\nI did enjoy the different planets that some of the characters were on. What I didn't enjoy and this is the reason I give it a 6/10 is things have become undone in the film, for example, Thor is given an eye...So what was the point in him losing it in Thor Ragnarok? There's a scene where Scarlet Witch destroys the stone in Visions head....it's an emotional scene and it's hard for her to do it but she succeeds......only to have Thanos bring him back and take the stone out of his head, which kills him anyway... *sigh*\nDoing that only makes the previous action or movie weak and pointless.  One of your favourite character's (the Hulk) who is shown in the trailer only has 15 seconds on screen....so no it wasn't all of the Avengers there. It didn't make sense why the Hulk was afraid and wouldn't \"join the gang\". I think it was so the writers could make Thanos unstoppable in the story. The movie would have ended a lot sooner if the Hulk was there. What a cop out. The ending of the film didn't make sense but was interesting enough. Once Thanos had all the stones, people started turning into dusk or leaves, Peter Parker disappears and that actually got me...that was the saddest part of the film. He was just a kid, who was trying to help out. However there will be another Spiderman film and I predict that somehow Marvel will find a way of bringing him back. \nIt was a good \"twist\" to the film, I don't actually know what it means....but it looks like we might be going back to the original Avengers.  Would I watch it again?.......Yes, Of course I will, it was still an alright movie.", "Some MARVEL' s mocked that DC universe is too dark, but how bright this movie is! As a huge MARVEL fan, start from the first Iron man and the latest Black panther. I love that they help people to live positively and to believe there is something good among us. However, a man with several stones destroy my dream. Never get in such a bad mood after watching movie. I know they will come to alive again, but this is also disappointed. I think children should not see this movie, because their mind might be poisoned. What can a normal person do when most superhero dead by a simple snap? Wait Captain Marvel to save us when MARVEL sent Spider man, Dr. Strange,... to die. Really, Really, Really disappointing movie.", "What a lame movie. AND LAZY! How brainwashed do you have to be to look at it as some sort of an art film LMAO. This is the epitome of 21st century trash popcorn films. 100% of this piece of garbage is, well, garbage. Superhero as a genre is a laughing stock.", "IF HAWKEYE WAS THERE WOULDV'E ENDED THE MOVIE REAL QUICK. HE WOULD'VE GONE FOR THE HEAD!!1111!!!!", "This movie was horrible! I'm not upset because everyone died, I'm upset because the climax sucked horribly.", "This movie was good at first but just went downhill very fast especially considering that lots of battles happened at once and that a lot of people die that just makes it bad. I do not reccomend this movie.", "Movie is just the average one. Not very exciting or enthusiastic other than spiddy character. Lot of useless scenes to get the viewers engaged. One time watch movie if you have watched all the Marvel movies.  Not to spoil I'll keep it short movie is overratted. One time watch and forget movie. You could save your precious time not watching it though.", "I thought this movie was good but not great like people were telling me. Spoiler - I kept thinking the entire time this was going to end up like Breaking Dawn Part 2 and everyone was going to be ok. Boy was I wrong. Spoiler - I mean they made these stones so dang powerful with Thanos using them, why couldn't the Avengers have just pulled the power together in the stones that they had and killed Thanos. I am looking forward to the ending when Thanos gets his. I still can't believe I actually paid to watch this.", "Just got out of Infinity War Part 1 (don't argue, it's true). As someone who doesn't like the MCU... It was ok. It's a movie where each 3rd progressively gets better. The first 3rd (besides the amazing opening) is the worst. It is an utter tonal mess. Anytime the film tried to do anything of meaning or impact they throw in a stupid joke right after it to break the tension. If the whole movie was this way that would be fine but even in the beginning some REALLY dark stuff happens. The second 3rd is a little better as the story picks up speed but if you asked me how the movie was halfway through I'd tell you it's terrible. The final act is where things finally get real and I'm not talking about action. Some really screwed up stuff happens and the tension actually rises. It honestly makes the earlier parts feel pathetic. This film is in dire need of a fan edit. Edit out the jokes and you'd actually have a good film. Some of the characters feel underutilized but that was bound to happen. It honestly doesn't matter though, Thanos is the main character and he is my favorite character from this franchise so far. He's intimidating yet emotional. He's the most morally complex character in the series and he won't be a let down for fans. Infinity War Part 1 is ultimately a hot mess and needs to be edited down to be more serious in the beginning. Luckily the final act grows a pair to save the movie. I'd give it a 7 but the score is too high so I made it a 6 for now. P.S. If you thought Civil War would have any influence on this one's story guess again. Alter a few lines and it never even happened.", "The movie is amazing. Rotten tomatoes score is ridiculous should be 100%", "---- WARNING: VERY LIGHT GENERAL INFORMATION ----  I do not believe I have spoiled anything.  Though read with caution or not at all if you have not seen this film. As I detail general feelings aimed toward certain parts of the film.  ---- END OF WARNING ---- \nSurpassed all expectation; leaves you in mourning after the passing of beloved heroes; waiting patiently to see the events of Avengers 4. This is quite simply not like anything you have ever experienced in the cinema. With undertones based on overpopulation crisis, genocide, loss and love; nothing can prepare you for the journey this will take you on. This is a movie that subverts expectation of any generic movie tropes you've come to expect from the genre; any issues can be understood and/or explained and Avengers 4 is almost impossible to predict following the events of Infinity war. The most notable feeling from the film is the complete harrowing silence and loneliness felt in the final 20 minutes of the film; 18 films of backstory have led to this moment; making it all the more heartwrenching to experience. I have read reviews calling out the following points: We live in a world where the 18 other movies exist. This is part of a larger story arc and must be reviewed and objectively appreciated as such; you wouldn't say a book lacks an explanation of the prior 18 in a series. This is a common critic problem, watch the previous films; it is common sense. I don't personally feel over character development makes sense in this film with regard to the Avengers and the black order. Subtle developments are seen throughout, this is a journey built around chaos. The lack of understanding of the group and quickness of events occurring is exactly what is needed. The characters in the story are outwitted, outsmarted and caught completely off guard by the events of the film.  The lack of development is a bonus, it is a realistic representation of what happens in life. Make no mistake, this is a Thanos story; to review it as something less than what it has earned because it subverts and doesn't match the expectation of the audience theories or ideas is senseless, idiotic, unfair and shows a distinct lack of understanding of the bigger picture. I can say 100% after seeing this, the scenes were clear, present and relevant; nothing is vague or hard to grasp or follow. If you are watching the film, there should be no issues; the pacing is brilliant, bringing a larger than expected amount of slow and personal points where you would expect giant set pieces. All in all, this is a near perfect film. With any issues being trivial or meaningless and understandable given the scale and ambition of the film.  Are things missing? Yes. Is it understandable why - given the larger picture - these were replaced by more important story points? yes, it is. Would you like the longer cut of the film? Yes I would, though I understand there is a large amount of deleted scenes that did not take precedent for the 2 hours and 49 minute mandate. To comment on a few other things. The transitions and scene composition in this film was flawless, melding together exactly the right tone for each scene; this was helped by Alan Sylvestri's brilliant score. The CGI - bar one 2 second scene - was believable and didn't take away from the film; were the story to be lacking in this department, or the characters not believable; this may have been distracting. Well done to Marvel and the Russo brothers.  This film stands apart not only from the comic book genre, but films in general as something special, bewildering, exhausting, tense, sorrowful but light-hearted at the right points. Consider the bar for comic book films raised.\n \nThis IS the best comic book film. Period.  Watch it without the backstory of the universe and it falls apart, but let us be realistic; they exist, let us stop ignoring the universe when everything special about this relies on the hard work that has gone into moulding the telling the previous stories.", "Basically Loki dies at the beginning and hulk is sent back to earth after getting beaten up by Thanos. The most horrible bit for me was when Thanos starts crying and kills Gamora in order to receive the soul stone.  The character that suffered the most in this movie was vision. He manages to get killed twice in this movie. Once by Scarlett Witch and again getting the mind stone ripped from his head by Thanos and losing his colour.  The most shocking scene in this movie was the death of Spider-Man. I didn't think they would kill him but I have a feeling that most the hero's apart from Loki and Vision will come back in the next movie some how.  I liked the cliffhanger of Captain Marvel at the end and I think that she is likely to maybe trick Thanos and bring back the dead hero's in avengers 4. Overall this was the best marvel movie I have honestly ever seen. I recommended seeing this movie and coming out with mixed emotions.  What a film. 10/10", "I went into this film, not fully up to date with the MCU, not yet seeing both the newest Thor and Black panther, making me a bit weary of the movie. Yet all it did was make me want to see these even more! This instalment was in my opinion so good, it gave me back the love for a series I started to feel was dying and oversaturated, but it was so incredibly fun. There were numerous moments I couldn't contain my laughter, just fun throughout however there was serious moments where the atmosphere changed, and you could feel and see that within the scene, making it a true movie moment, one special shutout for me was Tom Holland, who I think once again smashed his performance as Spiderman.  There was points that I thought maybe there is too many characters involved, however it was pulled off nicely to allow the story to develop but allowed everyone to get adequate screen time, so you didn't feel like anyone was really missed out. A large portion of the movie was a build for the third act as well as the second part, but well worth it. It gave characters who have not previously met time to connect and gain that bond which I thought was nice.  Overall the movie provided what anyone wants from a superhero movie, action and plenty of it, as well as plenty of fun and humour. Overall it was one of my favourite within the series so far, defiantly giving me a sense of faith within the series for the future and what is yet to come.", "I went into this film wondering if it would suffer from some of the problems of the last Avengers film, too many stories crammed into a very short period. Fortunately this is not a problem here, despite bringing together 10 years of marvel films they have absolutely nailed how to stop you feeling like It's all being crammed down your throat. Like a great magic trick Infinity War didn't start April 25th it started the first time we heard about Thanos and the infinity stones, by having his story already laid out there was no need to spend half the movie explaining then motivation of the villain and would you believe it actually mean we get to see a little character development for the big purple guy. Similarly because we already are familiar with the majority of the characters in this film we are left the best of their interactions, without having to worry about fluff.  Pacing is high intensity here, I couldn't tell you what period of time we by through the film but it seems to be secondary to everything happening, its a minor gripe but there is a strange lack of story, this sh*t is going down you best get on board with it. Again though because the story has already been explained in so many other films you just down seem to notice. Without spoiling anything then films ending is going to leave you with a billion and one questions which will probably mean an ungodly amount of fan theories while we wait for the follow up. Bringing this many characters together in one movie without feeling like anyone is being left short on screen time is a feat we don't get to see in cinema on this scale, if anything this is special for that reason alone.", "'AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR': Four Stars (Out of Five) The third installment (not counting 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR') in the blockbuster superhero franchise, based on the Marvel Comics' characters. This one has the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, to stop Thanos from collecting all of the Infinity Stones so he can bend reality to his will. The movie was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (who also both co-directed 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER' and 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and it was scripted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also both co-wrote all of the 'CAPTAIN AMERICA' movies). It stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Chadwick Boseman, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan and the voices of Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's expected to break all kinds of records at the Box Office of course. The movie is a pretty epic action flick, but it's a little light on actual character development and meaningful story.  The story begins two years after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', and the Avengers are still not on speaking terms. Thanos (Brolin) has come to earth to collect the last of the Infinity Stones, which will allow him to form a gauntlet that can bend reality to his will. Hulk (Ruffalo) has arrived just before him, to warn Tony (Downey Jr.) about his plans. At the same time Thor (Hemsworth) meets the Guardians of the Galaxy, in space, and the Avengers must later team-up with them in order to stop Thanos, and save the universe.  The film definitely has a great epic feel to it, and look, and the action scenes are spectacular. There's way too many characters in the movie though, and each one has their own little story; which when added all together makes the whole film feel kind of pointless and empty. I'm sure nerd comic book lovers will still love it, and on a purely superficial/technical level it's quite a film-going experience. In the end though, it's all style over substance, and it's kind of like movie junk food with no real value. It is better than 'JUSTIC LEAGUE' at least though.", "I have never felt so emotionally exhausted after watching a Marvel movie, but Avengers: Infinity War had me experiencing all sorts of emotions. Sadness, hope, despair.  Everyone left the cinema, spellbound, each reaching for the phone to find out if there was an explanation for anything that happens to the movie characters, and most importantly what the ending means.", "Avengers 3 reminds me why these Marvel Universes is so popular. They are stories involving a well-cast group of superheroes from the Marvel comic books. The first Avengers was a lot of fun, but disappointing because there were only a handful of the comic book characters fighting. Age of Ultron sucked and it was boring but this one, well, I admit that Guardians of the Galaxy got me excited for it, but it's great to see a bigger cast of superheroes. Thanos, in pure Voldemort scheme, is out looking for the Infinity Stones to give him the ultimate power, and the heroes must stop him before he finds them all. That is pretty much the movie. However, everyone has a story, including Thanos this time, and I realized halfway through the film, that he is a good villain. It took several movies but they finally have a good supervillain to face! YES! What makes this film great is that it has a perfect mix of action, comedy, and even backstory. The movie even takes time out to flesh out characters, and it does it in a way where it isn't boring. There is always something to look at, there are a ton of characters to cover, and the movie actually handles them quite well. I honestly don't have too much to gripe other than, if this is your first time seeing one of these Marvel movies, you might get lost. What a way to kick off the summer! I was excited for this and even had goosebumps with the trailer, but this film definitely delivered. It saddens me because I really hope DC gets this kind of following. As it stands, Marvel is dominating and Disney is banking. The steam isn't running out yet with this franchise.", "The only thing holding this very shallow plot together are the many deaths in the movie. The starlord scene is one of the worst ways ive ever witnessed to develope a plot. Thought the ending was a suprise, dont get blinded by it, its painfuly average at points and out right boring at others. 5-6/10", "Avengers: Infinity War- M gonna try to write this with as less as spoilers possible. But there will be some minor ones , so sorry for that.  Q. Is it the best MCU film overall?\nA. Yes. (not counting BLACK PANTHER , because i haven't seen it yet)\nQ. Does it has flaws ?\nA. Many. But its not the best MCU film by becoming perfect , rather the good things in the movie were so awesome , that you are totally gonna forget the bad things.\nQ. Is it the best written MCU movie ?\nA. Certainly not. If we consider just writing CAP AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER takes the crown. \nQ. Does characters die?\nA. O YES. Much More in numbers then u r expecting. \nQ. Does they will be left dead ?\nA. Certainly not. MCU is no Game Of Thrones. There are million ways a character can reborn. And this time the movie hinted a way itself . \nQ. Does that affect the emotional effect of those deaths ?\nA. Not At All . Its exceptional. The movie will punch u in the gut , really really hard , many times but specially in the climax , after the last fight. M pretty sure this movie has the bleakest Climax any Superhero movie ever had. MCU goes beyond DCEU level dark with this movie. To the level of darkness Nolan use to provide in Dark Knight Trilogy. And although i don't think this movie to be as good as Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises , but even those two movies didn't had such a sorrowful climax. As there were few , i would like to start (yes the review starts now , above it , was just the background, sorry if it gets lengthy) with the bad things.  \n1. Jokes didn't worked always. I mean the characters throws jokes in between some serious scenes , which didn't felt good. They also throws jokes when someone is on the verge of getting killed. This has been a major problem for me since the beginning of MCU. But yes , majority of the jokes land very nicely. \n  2. There were too many things in the movie happening simultaneously . Which again didn't feel good always. For example i really loved the WAKANDA action scene , but that fight sequence was cut at-least four times to show whats happening on the other storyline. That irritated me a little.  3. Many characters in the movie didn't got enough scenes for themselves , unfortunately most of them were my fav - CAP AMERICA , BLACK PANTHER and the whole WAKANDA team , Black Widow , Winter Soldier . Hawkeye was not even in the movie. HULK , o my my , how can they not use HULK. Everyone loves hulk, but except the opening scenes where HULK fights THANOS for a very small amount of time , the rest of the movie gave us Bruce Banner because apparently he is not able to change himself to HULK anymore. By the way there were no AntMan or Valkyrie either , but didn't missed them at all.  4. Then there was a single scene where a character did a really really really stupid thing even after 4 other characters were asking him not to do that. And by doing that thing , they lost really nice chance to defeat Thanos. And that stupid thing was done by (yes m gonna name him) STAR-LORD. \nSo whom did i liked most in the movie. Ofcoarse it was THENOS. He is an awesome villain . Infact the 2nd best villain of any Comic Book movies after - Yes Heath Ledger's JOKER. He was strong . He was menacing . But he had very clear thought. Particular goals . Which he thought to be the right thing to do to cleanse the Universe. He is not a villain just for the sake of being villain. He just don't go on killing people . He only kills them if it fulfills his higher purpose. He is emotional too. Also cries on the loss of loved one. Yes Yes Yes , he is able to love. Stakes were really high with him. Our heres were never in control of the situation , they were getting being defeated again and again .Josh Brolin did a damn good job with the motion capture technique , to make THANOS really really expressive.  When it comes to heroes. Two of my favorites were THOR (who was as good as he was is Thor:Ragnorak) with his jokes and his new weapon (an AXE) and his lightening power AND DR STRANGE (who was so so so much better here then his stand alone movie) with his EGOISTIC war with equally EGOISTIC Tony Stark and also his awesome Magical Powers.  Others get there time to shine too. But i am specially disappointed with DRAX , who although got enough screen time , is not contributing to the team enough , and was there in the movie to just crack jokes.  Then comes the action scenes. Loved each and everyone. Weather it was the small fist fight between Hulk and Thanos or the big and crazily crowded fight in Wakanda.  So lets end it with some small footnote points. \n1. I watched the movie in 2d , and totally loved it. So i dont know if its worth of the extra money to be spent on 3d.\n2. There was an end credit scene in the very end , so wait for it , which establishes a connection with upcoming MCU film , for which i was not much excited but some how that end credit scene gave me excitement. \n3. If in the early half of the movie u feel that its just good not the best , wait for the 2nd half as it gets better , and the end is totally mind boggling .\n4. Last but not the least , this movie has the best cliffhanger ever for any movie to set up a next installment, even better then the whole KATAPPA SUSPENSE of BAHUBALI 1 .  So yes , now time to wait. Avenger 4 is coming on 3rd May 2019. by ANuP APu KuMaR", "A culmination of year's worth of effort, groundwork and master-planning that started way back in 2008 with the seemingly risky Iron Man (wow I am getting old!), Infinity War has a world of expectations riding on the back of its hero-filled shoulders but as Marvel have proved time and time again, they're masters of meeting expectations and as is the case with this epic, messing with expectations as the Russo Brothers deliver what will be the year's biggest and most talked about blockbuster. Kicking things off with a memorable opening act that makes it clear we're in for a relatively unpredictable affair, Infinity War is a long and eventful action packed ride, the type of which must make the DC film hierarchy cry on top of their mountians of money, made from the mainly mediocre film offerings they have been toiling away on in the wake of Marvel and Disney's seemingly endless winning streak. Infinity War is filled with dazzling visuals, laugh out loud humor and a fair share of heart and soul, all of which feels earnt and appropriate in light of the decades worth of happenings that have come before it. It may not have the novelty factor and unexpected awesomeness that ran through the veins of the very first Avengers outing but after so much time and commitment, Marvel and Disney and in turn us the audienece have invested into this saga, Infinity War feels like something more than your average summer blockbuster experience that's event heavy and many various narrative strands are near perfectly juggled by the Russo Brothers. With so many key figures and important character arcs to deal with, its to be expected that certain players get less to do than others and some aspects of past occurances don't get much airtime but overall, fans of all shapes and sizes will find much to enjoy from the films beginning through to the films final frame as each hero and villain get their time to shine, with only this year's huge success Black Panther feeling like he may as well have stayed at home as the world fights for its survival. Fighting against purple baddie Thanos, the world and the universe have found a worthy adversary and pre-release doubts about Thanos feeling and looking menacing enough (doubts of which I shared) are quickly dispelled here with Josh Brolin doing a great job under the guise of his CGI performance, Thanos really is a piece of work and feels likely to be the Marvel universes greatest of big bads. Without entering into spoiler territory, aspects of Thanos's journey, his inward torments and motivations and his interactions are all handled extremely well and come the films climax, its clear Marvel have created a character and end game that will be both controversial and much-talked about for months and years to come. Final Say - There's a lot that can be said about Infinity War but most importantly this is a high-class blockbuster experience that feels like a worthy final piece of the puzzle to this particular phase of the Marvel cinematic universe. At times thrilling, funny, heartfelt and always entertaining, Infinity War will please all those who've followed the comic book series for the many year's gone before, with the Russo's film likely to be the king of 2018 blockbuster field. 4 1/2 rabbit's out of 5", "To make it spoiler free, I will only say this about the movie. The end shocks you, but for me the shock was to big to understand it fully. Since it kind of is a cliffhanger. Short review: it's eveyrhing you want and more. Extremely powerfull, extremely big, extreme on everything. It is a movie on its own but with a lot unaswered questions.  Should definitely be mentioned that Thanos is all over this movie. So expect him to shine in his role. Of course this is to be expected after 10 years waiting.  It's epic, it's insane, it's massive. It's everything for me to get goosebumps and wanting to jump out of my chair and say, YES THIS is worth my money!! Villains are important in movies. Thanos has been made on a Heath Ledger joker kind of way. Very strong and makes me give it a 9/10. I'm not easy on giving 9's, but it simply deserves it. // Leroy", "I'll tell nothing! The Marvel Policy says \u00ab No Spoiler \u00bb!", "Time to go slit my wrists. The entire theater left with angry/upset muttering. No clapping. They're going to lose money on this one.", "The culmination of all that came before. Can't wait for the next one!", "This movie is a big surprise and I didn't see that coming! First, the movie has all the good elements of a great epic movie. The Russo brothers obviously influenced by movies like star wars and lord of the rings, they managed to successfully run parallel adventures and storylines similar to these classics. Second, this is probably one of the best ever characterisation of a villain in a Superhero movie (even better than the joker in the Dark Knight). Thanos is the main character in this movie and the screenwriters did a great job developing a very complex villain charater. Thanons is super complex, fully of emotions and actually has a purpose in what he is doing and you don't find that often in villain characters.\nLastly, the action scenes were great especially the one with Captain America enterance! I don't even like Cap cause of his uber self-righteous character however his first appearance in the movie made me jump out of my seat like a 10 years old boy! The movie however has some flaws, like the fact that Dr. Strange could have finished all this fight using his time stone! Or that if the Avengers came together they would have finished off Thanos. But the most thing that really annoys me about this movie is that Marvel won't commit to the darkness that this movie presented i.e. keeping some heroes dead and most probably will bring them back alive in the sequel!", "This movie has been worked towards for 10 years. Many, were afraid that it would not live up to expectations. However, I am proud to say that it exceeded every expectation. This movie is brilliant. The acting, the storyline, it all came it all came together in a MARVELous movie. What makes this movie so good is that it surprises. It breaks away from the traditional superhero ways. All in all, it's tremendous", "Definitely a return to form for Marvel with Infinity War, but I predict the next movie will be a bit of a letdown as the conflict with Thanos has to be resolved. If you've read the comic, you probably have an idea what will happen, and I think it will probably end up being lame. Still, it was a well-made movie. I'm just getting sick of Black Panther and Wakanda though. Here you have an black superhero and his nation, which supposedly is some sort of breakthrough for black moviemaking and black comic book superheroes(laughably not true) yet the world of Wakanda is chock full of insulting, backwards stereotypes of African people in spite of the fact their society is so advanced, an alien race can't even break through its force field. Seeing the Wakandans use spears, dressed in tribal gear, just makes my eyes roll as well. Shuri is also the smartest person in Wakanda, dare I say, the only person in Wakanda who seems to be smart enough to engineer anything in spite of the fact their society was technologically advanced for decades, if not centuries. The stupidity of Wakanda is just infuriating and juvenile and I wish they would clean it up in future movies. I just refuse to watch any more Black Panther movies if they are made because I cannot stand anything about it. Also, the balance of power between characters just isn't logical. You will have one character like Hulk get the snot beat out of them, yet Captain America or Iron Man will easily go toe to toe with Thanos and his goons and put up a good fight. The one fight scene in Scotland was really bad; Vision and Scarlet Witch get the snot beat out of them, yet Black Widow, Captain America and Falcon easily make short work of Thanos's goons and run them off? This could have used some work but wasn't enough to ruin the film. I highly recommend this movie. It is a bit long though, but I never checked my watch.", "'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10", "Wow. I will not give any spoilers away. I will say that i have seen almost every Marvel film and this was the best ever. It blew all other Marvel and D.C. films out of the water.\nThe Visual Effects, the story, the acting (except Ruffalo), the Easter Eggs, the humour, the feels and everything else was Kir\u00e1ly (Hungarian for king or awesome). If you do not think this is the best Marvel film, then you obviously not a true film critic. Or maybe you have different taste than I do. I cannot wait to see it again and that is a rare statement for me.", "This was truly spectacular!! A lot more (excellent) humor than I perhaps expected, although it lessens when it goes down for some great emotional moments. And A LOT of shit goes down. the action set pieces are amazing and a lot of fun to watch. Thanos is also easily up there as one of the best and most menacing villains seen so far. I loved what they did with Peter Dinklage! That said, I can easily imagine the movie being hard to follow for those not well versed with the MCU, however, I think they do a pretty good job switching between the different groups. I'll definitely be rewatching this in the near future.", "(Spoiler Free) What an ending! Great portrayal of Thanos! Not what I was expecting at all, this isn't a masterpiece", "The Russo Brothers there so self-righteous. They think they made a big surprise in this movie.\nAnd what is the big surprise.\nIt ends bad. The bad guy wins\nWauw never saw that one coming.\nIn the end game they ruin the characters.\nThe Hulk, Thor.\nI will never watch a movie they make again.", "Wow. This movie is espectacular we have waiting for this moment 10 years ago for the moment that Iron Man gains the knowledge of the people, I just say thank you marvel and thank you Disney to make me happy.  This movie it's espectacular visually is tremendous. It's incredible how many people are working to make this movie an awesome movie. I think is the best movie of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) beacuse this movie puts together all the stiles of the 18 movies that we have seen before and it does incredibly awesome.  We have an incredible cast: Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Tom Holland as Spider Man, Chris Hemstworth as Thor all of them are incredible and Unic of this characters that they represent.  One thing that have this movie and don't have the other movies of the MCU is the villain Thanos is the best villain of the MCU, it's incredibly powerful and it has sense that all of our superheroes are fighting against him.  Let's talk about the bad things about Avengers Infinity War.  Avengers Infinity war has a lot of howls, there are so many moment that the movie has that you don't understand why happens something and instead that respond all the questions that we have they make that we should question ourselves many things more than we question at the first time.  So I totally recommend Avengers Infinity War.", "I'd like to preface this review by clearly stating that this movie has prerequisites to a certain degree. If you've seen every Marvel movie since The Avengers, you will know all of the characters and understand why they do what they do.  But, on the other hand, even if you don't even know the first thing about Marvel, it'll at least keep you entertained.  Avengers: Infinity War goes to incredible lengths to make you feel that you got your money's worth. The action is constant, the CGI beautiful, and casting nothing short of legendary. I think Marvel, and by extension Disney, set out to give the fans what they wanted from a high-budget action movie. Because of this high-octane approach to entertainment, the story is very simple, straightforward, and borders on cliche. Trying to layer more elements on top of their final product would have required more character interaction scenes, which to me, would have been welcome.  On top of this, if you have a favorite Marvel movie character, you might leave the theater wondering if he/she was what you wanted to see. The movie does an admirable job at giving the characters equal screen time and making sure everyone plays an important part, but on the other hand, a couple of my favorite characters didn't feel quite right. I attribute this to the fact that Avengers: Infinity War had a tremendous number of moving parts, and I think they just had to take certain liberties that were bound to make some fans shake their heads. For my last point, Avengers: Infinity War took risks. It took big risks. In a certain sense, this stays true to Marvel comics, which do the same. After a long line of Marvel movies that have generally exercised caution and given the fans a simple good against evil story, Infinity War goes beyond and feels as if it's bringing the series back to its comic roots. Because of this, I'm adding one star onto my initial rating of 8/10.", "I rarely write reviews, but then I've rarely had such an extraordinary time at the cinema. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' met and even ascended my expectations, and managed to balance a huge cast (my only doubt before the film) fantastically. My friend and I both left the film speechless, yet filled with so many theories and thoughts.  This truly is the first part of two, and it builds an unbelievably great foundation for the next film. Yet it somehow manages to tell it's own story without you feeling like this is a film cut off at the middle. You don't get a neatly wrapped ending, but I actually just don't care because the ending you do get is one of proper shock. That being said, I am a full-on Marvel-fan and as such I do know the characters backstories and the references to previous films being thrown around. I am more emotionally invested than someone not as familiar with the MCU franchise, and I don't know how well the film works for a person like that. I do believe that to fully enjoy it, you have to take your time and at least familiarise yourself with at least some of the backstory. But in the end, the target group is the fans, and this film surely delivers for us. I'd say it's on par, if not exceeding, with 'The Avengers'. It's sure gonna be a long wait for part two...", "I don't even know what to say...\nThe Russo Brothers have done it. They have surpassed themselves yet again and given us not only the best Avengers film to date but also the best film in the entire MCU. Some characters perhaps don't get enough screen time and some characters don't even interact with each other, but in a movie with so many characters (pretty sure the number was over 60 main characters), there's only so much that can be done. Firstly...Thanos! Sorry Loki, you have now been deranked to the 2nd place position for best Marvel Villain. And Killmonger, you're now 3rd. Thanos has claimed the Number 1 spot as the greatest Marvel villain. In just 5 minutes, you're shown why Thanos is such a threatening villain. Swiftly killing off heaps of innocent people, beating the crap out of THE HULK of all people, killing 2 beloved characters and leaving another to die in space. I was blown away in the first 5 minutes of this movie. Now for the other characters. It may have only been 4 years in the making but seeing the Guardians of the Galaxy join forces with the Avengers was still a dream that was realized today when I watched this movie. And boy, it was amazing. The Guardians were as hilarious as ever, even going as far as to create tension between them and the Avengers for who could own the spotlight in each scene. Like I said, some characters are more Cameos than actual major characters. Of course, with over 60 characters, not everyone can be a major character. Rocket gets the most screen time out of all the Guardians, whilst the rest get maybe 5 to 10 minutes of screen time, kind of like Spider-Man in Civil War. But the Guardians are actually spread out throughout the course of the movie, so it felt like they were around much longer. The Action...mind blowing. As expected, this film suffers from shaky cam during action scenes, just like The Winter Soldier and Civil War, both of which were directed by The Russo Brothers too. But teamwork...such a major theme in this movie and boy, do these characters use teamwork. Seeing characters use Dr Stranges portals to attack Thanos from unexpected places whilst Star-Lord uses Dr Stranges powers to bounce around the place without touching the ground was amazing to see. The movie was also barely sluggish. Not once did I ever look at my watch to see how much longer the movie had because I was so invested in it. Even if a scene didn't have action, it had great banter between characters or the presence of one of the many great villains in this movie. Oh, and a certain someone from one of the very first MCU films shows up again, despite the rumors that he would never come back due to the actor not wanting to play the role again. Only a cameo but I literally shouted \"Holy SHIT!\" when he showed up on screen. Lastly, the stakes. Let's be honest, we all assumed that Thanos, even if he were to equip all 6 infinity stones, would most likely not use the stones to their full potential, because then no one would stand a chance against him and there wouldn't be any conflict. But we were wrong, he uses every stone to their fullest potential, making quick work of everyone around him multiple times throughout the movie.  And the end of the movie, a massive cliffhanger that leaves you depressed but thrilled at the same time whilst you wait a whole year for Avengers 4 to be released so you can figure out what the heck happened. 10/10\nBest movie in the entire MCU, possibly the best superhero movie of all time. Marvel has been building up to this movie for 10 years...and they gave us the blockbuster of a lifetime.", "Dont let these reviews fool you, this is not an exceptional new style marvel movie. its still the same old, no plot twist or major surprises. its basically the classic hero villain action movie format as always. That being said with their huge budgets they manage to cram in some really beautiful CGI and stunning visuals that will blow your mind, but the cringey humor and classical avengers ping pong interactions will not, the lame one liners and jokes are present as always which is sad being the time they have had to improve.", "Okay comic book film that is a 3 hour lead up to the next one.", "Silly humor, I didn't get Thanos logic, it just didn't make any sense to me. If you are not a passionate marvel hard-core nerd, you'll probably not enjoy the movie.", "What a boring, pointless and terrible movie. Marginally more entertaining than Civil War, better than Memento (because the constant scene flipping was at least in some sort of order), but less entertaining than watching paint dry. I can't write a subjective review because I feel saddened that I spent money to watch this. Perhaps I should have read some of the comic books first? I just can't stop seeing this as just yet another money maker for all concerned. For me, it was a stupid, erratic, often lost, story line that made little to no sense and stands only on the merits of the talented CGI artists. Bored, boring, boredom. Yawn, \"has it finished yet?\".. Synopsis: I would have been happier to have just written Marvel a check, then at least I wouldn't have the experience of: \"what a pile of ......\"", "I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but from my point of view Infinity War is way better than Endgame. I do feel like Endgame tried to copy some great scenes from Infinity War, yet those ones were miserably executed.\nThe only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(. I am really disappointed, I really hoped for something better and not that predictable.\nInfinity War has a great trailer, but the movie itself is quite amazing, almost reaches perfection in this SF movie segment.", "This is the Marvel movie that should be getting 7 Oscar nominations. This is better than Black Panther in every aspect, but it isn't a political film so it won't get the love it deserves", "Like every superhero movie, you get into it, at the first second.\nIt is also oversaturated of action scenes without any sense.\nIs not a bad movie, but not even close to be the best.", "Meh, its alright.\nThe CG is nice\nThe fights are cool\nThe Story is dumb\nThe deaths of no weight\nTheir was no reason to care what happened", "I swear, every one of these cool, powerful, trained warriors acted like idiots without power or any tactical thinking ability. The special effects etc tend to distract you from the horrible treatment of the Marvel heroes, at least.", "It was ok, but I was not overly impressed. Glad I didn't waste 20 bucks to see it in a theater.", "Infinity war is an overcrowded blockbuster that does not disappoint. While Josh Brolin delivers a performance of a lifetime as thanos. Putting the mcu in its most toughest spot yet.", "Here they are battling a villain so strong, that all the power they have is just not enough. They have brought in the entire marvel cast and this movie is on an epic proportion. Far outshines all the Star Wars movies.", "I will admit to feeling a certain amount of joy the first time I watched THE AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. Having just watched it a second time I can let those who felt the same that it holds just as much impact the second time around. No doubt it will on repeated viewings as well. It is that good of a movie. If you've been a fan of the Marvel movies based on the comics from the same company then you'll already know what some may not, that every single movie released to date has led to this point in time, to this very film. Hints of things to come were dropped like breadcrumbs along the way with each becoming more revelatory the closer we got. If you haven't been watching them then by all means go back and start with the first, IRON MAN, before watching this. It's not that you won't enjoy it watching it on its own but you'll miss so much of what takes place. Warning there are a few spoilers in this review. The film opens aboard a spaceship last seen in THOR: RAGNAROK which holds the remnants of Asgard. The evil plunderer of the Universe, Thanos (Josh Brolin), holds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in his grasp and has beaten him in search of the second jewel he seeks, the Space Stone, having already found the first one, the Power Stone. Presented the stone by Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) he kills Loki and heads out to find the next stone. Also on board is the Hulk who too is beaten by Thanos but who escapes with the help of Heimdall (Idris Elba). Thanos has had a glove made specifically for his singular purpose, to collect all 6 of the Infinity Stones. With all of them combined (missing yet are the Time Stone, the Mind Stone, the Reality Stone and the Soul Stone) it will provide Thanos with the power to alter reality and time itself, to control all things. His goal is to eliminate half of the population of the universe with the intent of \"saving it\" from overpopulation as resources dwindle. In his twisted mind he is to be considered a hero rather than someone responsible for mass genocide. Hulk, now in the form of Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) crashes into the sanctum sanctorum of Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and warns him of the upcoming arrival of Thanos and his minions. No not THOSE minions. Strange contacts and returns with Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) just as the evil doers arrive seeking the stone Strange possesses, the Time Stone. A nearby Spider-Man (Tom Holland) also swings in to help. Before Stark can reach out and contact Capt. America (Chris Evans) he, Spider-Man and Strange are onboard the spaceship heading towards Thanos. Rather than continue with each story point I'll stop hear. And this so far only accounts for perhaps 30 minutes tops of this 2 hour and 29 minute masterpiece! With the exception of only 3 heroes already seen in the previous Marvel movies (Ant-Man and the Wasp which is explained in their own movie and Hawkeye) every single hero shows up to do battle in this one. Every Avenger, Black Panther, War Machine, the Winter Soldier and all the Guardians of the Galaxy are on hand to face off against Thanos. The question though is are they enough? Can they take down the most powerful being in the Universe? And if he gets all of the stones, will he be able to achieve his goal?  The answer is yes and no. When you get to the final moments of the film, a heart wrenching moment in heroic film history, the answer is still unknown. Yes know going in that the final answer is not on hand to be seen here. A second film is on the way and will no doubt pick up with the remains of this film. Not all of the heroes we've come to know and love will survive. None of those that remain will be left unscarred. And in a battle to save the known Universe all will lay their lives down on the line as a last defense to do so.  Our civilization has always used mythology to move us forward, to teach valuable lessons. They began with drawings on cave walls, altered to stories passed down verbally, reached the printed page, changed slightly to four color comics, moved to radio and then to the big screen. Movies have become the current medium in which mythology has decided to rest. The Marvel movies which began as comics and have since embraced movies are there to provide a way of continuing the tradition of teaching valuable lessons to those who witness them. Sacrifice, loyalty, heroism, love, failure all are on display in these films and this film combines all into a massive epic that has to be seen to be believed.  The end result of watching this film is not total sadness or joy but an anxious feeling, one in which the viewer wishes that the months were over between the viewing of this film and the next. Until that time this movie will be viewed repeatedly by fans who will wait for the next, ticket money in hand and hoping for the best for those heroes that they've come to love to be among those who will survive. This is the movie that has long been developing and it delivers on every single level expected of those who love movies.", "We are waiting for this movie and finally it cames ! Everything on it was amazing.\nThe story and the characters perfect, the plow twist fantastic and the end........OH MY GOD !!!!! I'm looking for the part 2 !!!!", "Having seen this movie, I am at a loss for words.\nStarting with: Thanos beating the hulk. So no more the madder hulk gets ect.?\nThanos grunting to lift the hulk over his head.\nI guess Hulkie has put on a few pounds between movies.\nthe horrible use of the vision in this movie.\nEVERYBODY can kick his butt.\nHe played the almost helpless heroine role in this flick.\nOne of the most powerful avengers bitched slapped by every child of Thanos in the room.\nEven without the mind of reed Richards in the mix.There is enough 'big' brains in the ensemble of avengers to work out a better plan then 'Just wait for Thanos to arrive'.\nAnd the fact NO use of the technology from any of the other movies is even mentioned ..well the Black Panther had the same suit...but maybe it was laundry day, so he had to ware his old stuff.\nWhen did the Asgardian GODS become such wimps?\nThese people are a WARRIOR people.\nThe live for war.\nWell these people sure retreat like no other.\nOh and where is the Odin force?\nNot with this thunder god\nobviously\nWhy couldn't Doctor Strange use the time stone?\nI guess all those portals he and Wong were throwing around like there was no tomorrow were just for show.\nYou know they cant be used for offensive purposes .\nJust ask Cull about this.", "I actually love the movie effects, the crossovers are completely accurate, but from the third stone to the disintegration scene, it is totally ankward and unsatisfying. Like they focuses on thanos and how the heroes loses the fight for infinity stones and that's it.", "Not a big fan of marvel ... but it was their best movie", "Rank system i use is it can only be ONE movie that is the best and then get 10, to get a 9 it have to be something extraordinarily like Alien and so, a 5 is a ok movie nothing more nothing less its simple a mainstream movie. As i wrote in the topic it was just to much to many super heros and mix off them simple felt to much and the Movie was like 1hour to long.", "This could have been epic, instead they decided to make a movie that included everyone, and in doing so diluted the story down to a series of independent adventures.  In the end, it was hard to care.  It did have some nice special effects.  Spoilers: At least the \"bad guy\" won. \nThe next movie had better not have time travel, or witchcraft, that changes that back to a happy ending.", "Marvel has done the inconceivable. I'm happy to admit that Avengers: Infinity War is the best team up movie in the franchise since Joss Whedon's first Avengers film. But is that too much of a good thing? The answer is a resounding yes, but in a sense that it can be let loose and do whatever it wants while strictly aiming towards fans and non-fans. It's not perfect by any means, but for the most part it is like a vending machine loaded with colourful geekiness, going full throttle on humour, enthralling set pieces and surprising moments that still thrill. Even the third act is as satisfying and effective as anything we've seen before. The plot really kicks into gear from the get-go, not spending any time on setup and delving straight into the action. The past 18 instalments did the business of building everything up. Long story short, over 20 superheroes team up to take down the most powerful villain in the galaxy, Thanos (Josh Brolin). Rather than telling the story in predictable fashion, the script executes it unconventionally with splitting every character up into a different situation all over the place. Iron Man, Doctor Strange (the two Sherlock's: Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) team up, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) pairs up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while Captain America (Chris Evans) reunites with his Civil War crew. What makes their interactions compelling is the commitment and energy that everyone involved brings to the film. Writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus structure scenes excellently, but the Russo brothers adapt them to the screen almost without a problem in sight. Where the duo's previous Marvel work were on the forefront of political seriousness, this time they channel the fanboy gleefulness that superhero films deserve, something that original director Joss Whedon had a knack for. They've just about matched him in terms of style. Thanos is engaging but not the bad-guy-wants-to-destroy-the-world stereotype that you could imagine. He's humanly developed and masterfully designed, but perhaps not as empathetic or relatable as Killmonger in Black Panther. As the plot roaringly progresses forward, so does he. This culmination doesn't always work. There is so much going on at once that sometimes you lose track of where you are and what's happening. The moments with underused characters frequently feel rushed, which makes scenes more appealing than others. Formulaic exposition can sometimes put the comedy to rest. But for a film as bulky as Infinity War, you can't have everything. It learns lessons from the frustrating overkill of subplots that plagued Age of Ultron and Civil War and goes for something leaner in its approach. More than a 'greatest hits' compilation, the film is the Pulp Fiction of the superhero genre. It is so good that it makes Justice League look like Batman and Robin.", "I've seen all the Marvel movies so far. And although it nice seeing all the characters together it couldn't really convince me. A couple of things bothered me;  1. Wipe out half the universe? Really? \n2. The humor didn't work for me. They tried, but previous movies were simply better with the jokes. \n3. Some marvel characters not in the movie because they had family issues? While someone is trying to wipe half the universe? \n4. The storyline felt a bit too much and chaotic.  The CGI was great however and at no point in time i felt it becamw boring. Well worth going to the theaters for, bur a bit overrated here at IMDB.", "Why? Why the precious Peter Parker? Why??? Whhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyy???????????????", "Irrespective of what everyone says the truth is not everyone really understood the movie in India especially I didn't understand why there were people laughing at dr strange saying it was the only way also spider mans death sequence being laughed loudly by stupid audiences trying to prove that they are a marvel encyclopaedia but nevertheless what a magnificent movie kudos to the Russo brothers for making a blockbuster movie entertaining and engaging for everyone \nCaught this with my 85 year old grandpa and at the end even he was applauding only bcoz of how well this movie was made sheer brilliance \nAnd a big Big thanks", "Avengers: Infinity War is in my opinion the best mavel movie to date. It is unlike any movie I have ever seen before. It hasn't got a basic 3 part storieline and it doesnt introduce any of the heroes. This movie focuses more on introducing and following the villain. You heard that right, Thanos is the lead character in this movie. It is more a Thanos movie than an Avengers movie, and that is what makes this movie as great as it is. It is not your standard superhero movie and definitly not your standard marvel movie. Finally marvel has a great villain. Also the humor is on point in this movie and the avengers are great as always. In my opinion thor is my favorite avenger in this movie and his character has the most development of all the avengers. I gave this movie a 10/10, but i have to honest and say that i am a bit of a mcu fanboy. I think that if you like marvel movies in general you won't be disapointed, but if you have never liked marvel movies than this movie won't change your mind and you should better go and see another movie. I recommend seeing the other marvel movies first before watching this one, because it can be confusing for poeple who don't know these characters. All in all, great marvel movie with a great villain.", "When the first Avengers film was released in 2012, there was much hype for it, much like Infinity War, but it actually lived up to it. Fast forward six years later, with Infinity War and many new members in the crew, and now fans are given a rushed action film with cheesy one liners. Upon going into the film, I checked the writing on IMDb and saw it was a 9.0/10. Seeing the rating really intrigued me, in which I was expecting so much only to be disappointed. \n1. Thanos in no way intimidated me like he did when I read the comics. Josh Brolin could have done better at the role. I found him more intimidating in Labor Day, or the Goonies back when he was 17.\n 2. There was just too many stories for one movie. In order for it to work, this film would have needed to be nearly 5 hours long, like Gone With The Wind. \n3. Why did that massive battle scene on earth with Cap and the rest of crew resemble Star Wars: The Phantom Menace? Literally all I could think of was Jar Jar Binks throwing blue balls at Thanos' army and calling it a day.\n 4. Out of all 80 of the main cast, I felt the only characters with the best chemistry were Rocket and Thor. \n5. What was up with Bruce Banner having hard time turning to Hulk? Is that his way of having an Erectile Dysfunction? I mean Hulktile Dysfuntion... That whole bit was just weird. \n6. Some of the characters, like Starlord, Drax, and The Vision were not the same characters they were in previous films. Starlord is smart, sarcastic, and cocky. In this film, he's dumb. Same with Drax, he was real insecure and always on edge. In this film he's just there. \nLastly, The Vision. What happened to the wise man we saw in Age of Ultron? Yes, he had feelings, and I understand he had evolved, but has millions of traits and personalities. I don't understand how such a strong character became so weak. Overall, this film was pretty mediocre when it came to acting and the action scenes. We've seen them all before. Of course being a comic book/superhero fan for nearly 20 years, I will watch the next film, but most likely wait till it releases to redbox or other streaming services. \nI rate this film a 5/10 because 1. The all star cast. 2. Decent action and CGI that will most likely attract younger viewers. 3. Rocket and Thor's chemistry. 4. Scarlett Johansson. 5. It's Marvel. Other than that, if you haven't seen the film, just wait till it's released on DVD or Netflix. Not worth the trip.", "I'm not a follower of the Avengers movies, and I only went to see this one because I had a MoviePass. Yes, I know the comic book lore of the Avengers team and Thanos and the Soul Gems, it's just that the movie falls under its own weight of too many superheroes with too many subplots. Each character's presence is diluted because of the need to give fair screen time to each. Spider-Man, Bruce Banner, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, each Guardian of the Galaxy. And I don't know if it was just me, but the actors kinda seemed to phone it in for the most part. Of course, this isn't Tolstoy, it's a bunch of people with mutant or augmented superpowers traveling through space-time to stop an intergalactic warlord from retrieving gems that will give him the ability to rebalance the universe. There's a lot of contemporary humor in the movie, namely the millennial snark found in modern sitcoms. I don't get the hype, but I do appreciate that some people will like this. That's the beauty of having individual tastes: someone's pudding is someone else's broccoli. It just wasn't for me, and I don't have an interest in seeing the conclusion of this anthology, even with MoviePass.", "The movie is great and fun, definitely raising the bar.If you are into comics, this is the movie we deserve! \nBut just stop with the overrating and all the 10/10 seriously!\nThanos relation with Gamora feels pushed, there's no explanation of so many little things, this is no where close to perfection but doesn't make any less enjoyable though.\nWatch it, have fun and be \"sane\".", "DISCLAIMERS:\n1. I've watched every marvel movie, read many marvel comics and loved most of them.\n2. Many people believe this movie is great simply because it is a culmination of all of it's predecessors. I agree. Well, at least that's the only reason I didn't rate it lower. Review (SPOILERS AHEAD): Fight scenes 3/10:\nGiven that this is an action movie, I'll begin with the fight scenes. It would take too long to explain why the choreography in this movie sucked but if you're interested in good choreography consider reading these.\nA good example of the bad choreography in this movie was in the final scene. Just as Vision is about to die each avenger decides to take a turn stopping Thanos. Why the hell are they not fighting like a team if they are one? Marvel managed to do this so well in Age of Ultron so why did they fail so badly here? And quite frankly, even their individual fight sections looked stupid. No style, simply smashy smashy in the bad guys general direction and everyone goes flying.\nOther than that the powers were simply too inconsistent. Why could Thanos simply obliterate the Guardians without even touching them with the reality stone in one scene and then in his fight with Iron Man and Doctor Strange he never even touches that power? (Side note, in that same scene, Will punching Thanos really irritated me. Oh look, the bad guy is going to be defeated, psych, the hero decides that would ruin the movies run time cliche sucks)\nFinally poor comedy timing is the nail in the coffin. Comedy can be great in an action movie to lighten the mood or make a character less serious. But timing is key. A joke in an action scene removes the tension from the scene and makes it a lot less epic. If this is what you were going for great. But I have a feeling they wanted the viewers to actually fear and rever Thanos, not see him as an idiot with some cheat codes. Music 7/10:\nDespite actually good sound tracks, they don't match the scenes behind them at all and that really sucks, because I enjoyed the music. Looking at the final scene again for an example, it's slow and dramatic, yet the scene certainly doesn't feel like that. Star Wars 8 (Ship through ship) and Avatar (Zuko vs Azula) both used this type of music to great effect. Why does it work there? Because the colors are mellowed down, the movements are slowed to the pace of the music and everything works together. This is just one example in this movie but it's the same in every scene, the music just doesn't fit. Plot 4/10:\nOh boy, the plot. Yes, this movie does have the benefit of 31 movies to replace the exposition. But that's all they are, exposition, not a replacement for plot. The fact the biggest tension I felt was due to a bet I made with someone over whether Iron Man will drop out of the universe for the next movie or not indicates there is a problem. I knew anyone who died in this movie held no real significant effects down the road.\nThe little plot there is suffers from bad writing. There is a reason there is a standard formula to all forms of story, because it works. A standard story has one climax to it, at the very end. This is because a climax is all the conflicts coming together into one important scene that holds a lot of emotional weight for the viewer. A good writer can fit two or even three climaxes in a story but any more than that and the viewer simply won't care anymore. That's what happened with this movie. Every single hero had to have their own climax scene and so I simply didn't care because that's all the movie really was. Characters: 8/10\nThe movies saving grace is its characters. Everyone going to this movie should have at least one character they are already invested in and love. Also there was some decent character development, especially with Thanos. Final notes:\nI really wanted to love this movie and I'd heard great things about it before going. And yet, I simply didn't feel the emotional investment or the sense of epicness that other marvel movies have given me. Luckily they cut the cast down to the original avengers and now that they got every characters little moment of greatness out of the way with this movie, there is hope that phase 4 will finish off with a truly epic movie deserving of its place as the end of an era for MCU.", "SPOILER: The Marvel Cinematic Universe movie series has been fantastic, many fans including me were happy to see it celebrating its tenth anniversary, this next instalment in the Avengers series, bringing together over twenty Marvel superheroes, was the most ambitious and high anticipation, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his lieutenants - Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon), Ebony Maw (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Corvus Glaive (Michael James Shaw) and Cull Obsidian (Terry Notary) - have acquired the Power Stone. They intercept the ship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction, they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is subdued and Thanos kills Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and overpowers Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Heimdall (Idris Elba) transports Hulk to Earth before being killed, then Thanos and his lieutenants leave and the ship is destroyed. Hulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner, there he meets Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wong (Benedict Wong) and warns them of Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe, so Strange recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Maw fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment, but captures Strange. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, while Banner contacts Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum. In Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) in-order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) rescue them and shelter with James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle) at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself, to have the Mind Stone destroyed to keep Thanos from retrieving it, Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which may have the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision. The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, he surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector (Benicio Del Toro) on Knowhere. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) accompany Thor to Nidavellir, Thor is also given a new eye, on the now deserted planet they and Eitri, King of the Dwarves (Peter Dinklage), create an enchanted battle-axe called Stormbreaker capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zo\u00eb Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) find Thanos who has already got the Reality Stone in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter, she is forced to reveal the location of the Soul Stone as her captive adoptive sister Nebula (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan) is being tortured. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull (Ross Marquand), keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves, Thanos reluctantly throws Gamora off a cliff, granting him the Soul Stone. Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan, Thanos' destroyed homeworld, Stark and Parker have rescued Strange and killed Maw, ejecting him from his ship, they land at Titan and meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet, while Strange looks into the future, he finds only one in millions of possible futures in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plan is necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation, the group manage to subdue him, until Nebula deduces that he killed Gamora. Quill is enraged and retaliates, allowing Thanos to break away and overpower the group, Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark, Thanos then departs for Earth. In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) before Thanos and his army invade, the Avengers, alongside T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the Wakandan forces, mount a defence while Shuri (Letitia Wright) works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner is unable to transform into the Hulk, he fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armour; Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the defenders, while Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed, and their army is routed. Maximoff attempts to destroy the Mind Stone, but Thanos arrives and retrieves the stone from Vision, destroying him, Thor severely wounds Thanos, but with all stones completing the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos activates it, clicking his fingers and teleporting away. Thanos' plan succeeds, as a result, half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker; Stark and Nebula remain on Titan, while Banner, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, M'Baku (Winston Duke), and Thor are left on Wakanda, meanwhile Thanos rests and recuperates on another planet. After the credits, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) witness many people disintegrating, causing destruction, Fury is able to transmit a distress signal before he and Hill disintegrate, the device displays a star insignia on a red-and-blue background (meaning Captain Marvel). Also starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and Stan Lee as the Bus Driver. All of the cast as the superheroes are fantastic as usual, and Brolin is brilliant as the malevolent supervillain, there is a lot going on at once, but thankfully I followed it all, the special effects are spectacular, and the constant explosions and fight sequences are exciting, I wasn't expecting to end so dramatically and sombre, I cannot wait to see what happens next and how the heroes will be returned, overall this is a fantastic fantasy action adventure. It was nominated for Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!", "Avengers: Infinity War is a whole movie. Actually, it's a movie and a half of a half of a movie, because it comes in hot at roughly 150 minutes of punch-you-in-the-face, stab-you-in-the-chest, blow-your-hair-around, melt-your-skin-off, shave-your-back action. Phew! The movie should come with a moist towlette or two, or at least a travel-sized pack of tissues. Thanos is big, bad, and blue (I think). He believes, much like I do, that overpopulation and scarce resources lead to strife and suffering. Instead of using infinity stones to do something like, say, increase crop output or resiliency to pests, he decides to harvest the infinity stones and put them into a really cheap looking metal gauntlet. Then, at the flick of a finger, he can make exactly half of the universe's (humanoid) populations flake away like chaff in the wind. This begs several questions, of course. First, what if there are an odd number of humanoids in the universe? Do we get to round up or round down? Would that be on a universe, planet, or spaceship basis? Do the infinity gems use a truly random algorithm to determine which half die? If it is a psuedo-random algorithm, can we deduce a non-stochastic, deterministic pattern? Next question: once half the universe is gone, is that it? Do we wait for it to sort of build back up to crisis levels and then flick the fist finger again? Or do we eliminate half the population every month or so, logarithmically and asymptotically reducing the universe's humanoid population to zero? I digress. Bucky and Steve do not kiss, not even with crappy CGI.", "There are two group of audiences: (a) those whose background knowledge comes entirely from watching some (perhaps all) of the previous 18 \"related\" movies and (b) those who have read (some even grew up with) these Marvel comics. This makes a big difference because the second group have a pretty good idea where things are going with \"Part 2\", subject to how closely the moviemakers follow the comics. It is also interesting to note that some critics in the first group spill a lot of nonsense that reflect their ignorance, using only their guesses to predict where things are going. I belong to the first group but unlike these critics, I am fully aware of my ignorance. Just like the \"Harry Potter\" or \"Twilight\" franchise, the grand finale of The Avengers, \"Infinity War\", could be entitled with the informative notation of \"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\". Indeed, that was the initial intention, although I wouldn't try to second-guess why this idea was abandoned. A majority of the world's population know, of course, that one final movie is scheduled for release next year. Many would like to believe that, like the two other aforementioned movies, the gloom the audience take home from the dark tone on which Part 1 ended will be expelled by a glorious finale in Part 2. Will it? I guess we will have to make sure we stay alive in the next 12 months to find out. The consolation is that the wait would still be shorter than that for Game of Thrones or Star Wars. The one-week spoiler ban for the critics has passed and I am not a critic anyway and have dutifully included my IMDb user review spoiler warning. Among the 76 characters in this movie, the single most important one is the villain Thanos (well-casted Josh Brolin) who, for the first time ever for any villain in a scifi-fantasy, arguably has a \"noble\" agenda - the humankind in entirety. The logic is so simple that it may sound farcical: just eliminate half of it and the remaining will live happily ever after with adequate resources. I said farcical but if you think about it, it is so realistic that it will send a shudder down your spine. To give Thanos's ultimate, mind-boggling power is a set of six \"infinity stones\". He is already in possession of a couple of those at the start of the movie, which is about his acquiring the remainder. The last one, bringing the movie to an emotional climax, is implanted in Vision's forehead. To stop him, the superheroes from the two main groups (Avengers and Guardians of the Universe) plus a handful of independent movies (making a total of the abovementioned 18) are sort of regrouped. I'll mention only the key ones here and I won't attach the name of the actors.  The odd couple of Iron Man and Spider-Man teams up with Doctor Strange. I said I won't mention the actors but if you think about the ones in this grouping, you will be amused at the idea of Sherlock Holmes bantering with himself (the movie-screen version vs the TV-screen version).  Vision and Scarlet Witch, you will perhaps be delighted to find, have now a sweet romantic relationship. Under attack (resulting in Vision being badly injured), they are rescued by Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon, and together forms a group joined by The Hulk who stubbornly hides inside Bruce Banner, refusing to come out when he is needed.  Thor, with a somewhat different persona, joins the \"Guardians\" and just imagining the bantering between a serious Thor and a flippant Star-lord will make you smile. But he soon spins off with the two animated characters Groot and Rocket on a special mission and, oh joy, encounters a new character, a dwarf played by Peter Dinklage. Gamora, who is a critical role in this movie, set off with Drax and Mantis for another mission.  Black Panther and company have the dubious fortune of having their homeland as the final battlefield. There are many other characters that I skip mentioning here, the presence of quite a few of those are barely registered. Entirely absent are Hawkeye and Ant-man. Nick Fury and Agent Maria Hill appear in the teaser at the end of the credit roll if you care to wait, and wait, and wait. The background material and theories surrounding the grand finale next year can fill a few volumes of an encyclopedia. At time of this writing, Infinite War ranks #9 in the IMDb top 250 with an IMDb user rating of 9.0.", "Having been a recent convert to the MCU, I had only watched five or so of the more than dozen movies over the past few years. With the advent of Movies Anywhere, I collected all of them and watched them in the past month. I went into Avengers: Infinity War with pretty high expectations. Thanos had to be the ultimate villain that was not only calculating, but immensely powerful. The different heroes had to play off each other's abilities well. And the stakes had to be high. Very high. Well, the Russo brothers and Kevin Feige more than delivered. This film not only met all those expectations, but delivered more, giving us a complex character in Thanos, and not pulling ANY punches on the way to the 'end game', and having an ending that left me completely stunned. It literally took me an evening and the next morning to process everything I had watched... something that is a hallmark of a good film. Totally 11/10.", "That green infinity stone cripples the movie, I really wish they would be smart when they give us, the time stone (green infinity stone) back in Dr strange film.  \nIn infinity war, Stark asked Dr strange if he was willing to let stark and spiderman die in order to protect the stone and not let them be bargaining chips for Thanos. Dr strange said without a heartbeat: \"yea I'll let you die b4 that will happen, bro\"  Later Stark is dying and Dr strange gives in, hands the stone to Thanos(saving Stark). \nThe movie was doom from that point on (for me) I am 100% dr strange knew he could revert any damage done by Thanos. if he could retrieve the stone again. \nSo now Marvel looks edgy when they let half of the Marvel heroes die and Thanos \"wins\" in the end...... But time travel baby!  Yea I will let you guess what happens in the next movie.  entertaining, felt no investment in the characters after that, all can be undone.", "If you haven't seen the movie, scroll away now. You've been warned. Now. Into the movie I've been waiting ten years of my life for. I'm gonna go through the whole movie. First off, Loki dying was a given. If there was anything predictable at all, it was that. Another thing that might be a flaw is that Idris Elba's character dies and I wanted soo bad to feel for him, but I just simply didn't. When the story finally came down to Earth, I loved the feeling of urgency. You literally get kicked into the action and the Avengers have hardly even assembled yet and there's stuff going on in the streets! You get to see Tony Stark and Banner and Doctor Strange run through the smoky streets looking for answers to the destruction around them and they find Thanos's servants: The Black Order. If anything, they weren't much more than mini bosses you fight to get to the real deal. The fight scenes on the streets were amazing (as with all of them in this movie) and it was a great introduction. Back on Earth, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Banner (Because the Hulk is scared to awaken since Thanos beat the green out of him), Captain America (Now, Nomad), Black Panther, Winter Soldier, War Machine, and Falcon prepare for an attack on Wakanda, all the while, trying to remove the Mind Stone from Vision's head. If I had a problem with any of that storyline, it is that it was a little rushed into. Something I loved however, was Thanos. This was his movie, almost more than the Avenger's. He is so fleshed out and you understand his motives. He really is doing what he truly believes is right. He is, in fact, the \"mad titan\". He has got more story, more emotion than ANY villain Marvel has thrown at us. He even kills his own daughter just to get the Soul Stone. And while we're on that subject: Red Skull is ALIVE. I just knew he wasn't dead back in the first Captain America movie. Back to Thanos. Throughout the movie you learn to hate this guy with such a passion. He is literally the most powerful being in the universe and you feel it completely. While the movie is going on you have this sense of dread. That something is coming, that some eventual threat is gonna make it's appearance. Now let's talk about a sensitive subject. When Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and half the Guardians of the Galaxy actually have Thanos pinned down.. and then StarLord finds out that Gamora is dead and literally screws half the universe. They have the Gauntlet almost off of him, but Quill let his love and anger get in the way. I, for one, am not mad. In the moment, he was angry and blinded by rage. He lost his mom, had to kill his dad, and now another person he loves has died and he couldn't do anything to stop it. He was acting on his gut and it cost a giant price. In that same fight sequence, Iron Man is fighting harder than you've ever seen him fight before. He is punching and creating shields and his armor is tearing. And then Thanos stabs him, and I honestly thought that was it. I was about to be in tears as my favorite hero was about to die. And then Doctor Strange offers the Time Stone for Tony's life. Some people have a bone to pick with this but I believe it's all a part of Strange's bigger plan. Earlier, on Titan, he went through so many timelines to see if their outcomes and they only win one. And then at the inevitable ending, he tells Tony, \"It was the only way.\" Showing that he had to make this sacrifice to have the eventual victory. Peter Dinklage was the dwarf at the birthplace of the Infinity Gauntlet and Thor's Hammer and it was a little awkward to see him that way but I was fine with it. Also Thor's new axe (and eye) is amazing. The Wakanda fight scene was, like I said, rushed, but ended up showing some amazing fight scenes, such as: Captain America and Black Panther running and fighting side by side, or Scarlet Witch showing off the true power of her abilities. And when Thor came down with his new axe, he obliterated tons of those weird dog-like aliens. And it almost feels like they are actually winning.. and then Thanos shows up. Thanos is here for the last Stone and with 5 already, he is unstoppable. It was hard to watch as literally almost every Avenger hurled themselves at him and he merely flicked them away like flies. Before he can get to Vision, Scarlet Witch destroys the Mind Stone.. only for Thanos to rewind time and rip it out of Vision's skull. As his body fell limp and grey, I could only imagine was Scarlet Witch was feeling. The one thing I didn't expect was when Thor almost killed him. I thought to myself, \"Hey, this could be a good enough ending.\" And then Thanos wins. He snaps his fingers and half the universe dies just like that. And the big deaths begin to happen. All of the Guardians die, except Rocket, and he even had to watch Groot die in front of him. Bucky dies as Steve Rogers falls to his knees and is literally speechless to see his best friend turn into ash. Black Panther dies (which through me for a loop). Then Falcon and some of the Wakandans die, along with Scarlet Witch herself. I think the most heart wrenching moment was when Spider-Man began to fade away. He literally grabs onto Tony, his mentor, and begs for his life. He tells him that he's not ready to go, and Tony has to sit there as he dies in his arms. I still can't believe Marvel did that. They actually killed around 14 characters in the span of two and half hours. And 10 of them were in the span of 15 minutes. It was horrifying to watch these heroes die off one by one. For the first time, the villain wins. For the first time, I don't know what to expect to happen next. Half of the roster just died and it's too much to comprehend. This is the most serious, beautiful, and high stakes movie Marvel has ever created. The credits feel like an obituary to those who were lost. This movie was indeed a Marvel Epic, and I can and cannot wait to see what happens next year in Avengers 4. And on the end credit scene: I can't wait for Captain Marvel. This movie broke me, put me back together, and then tore me apart again. I love and hate this movie. This will be day in cinema history. 10/10 all the way.", "The writing and the dialogue between characters was just fantastic. They really did a great job with this movie!", "Finally, it arrived.  And what a great addition to the MCU. I just got out of the movies and i am overwhelmed by the emotion.  The russo brothers had a big job cut out for them, and boy did they deliver in style. It is absurd to think about a movie with so many main characters. And the directors achieved it with sheer brilliance.\nThe writers managed to create a tearjerker with perfect proportion of all elements. Nothing seemed out of place in the story. \nThe soundtrack is as always great. \nThe fight scenes are very well choreographed and brilliantly filmed and edited. \nThe villain, Thanos is exceptional. Finally marvel delivered a great great villain. His back story and aim was well done.  Finally i would conclude by saying it's definitely the best marvel movie and also one of the best superhero movies of all time. It definitely deserves all the hype its getting.", "I am utterly speechless! This film was just everything!", "Movie was the Bomb! The best MCU film to date and the definition of the perfect comic book movie! Thanos is the best villain that's ever been presented on the silver screen and the movie managed to juggle multiple plot lines and characters with ease!", "--- WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS AROUND GENERAL TIMING AND EVENTS ---- Surpassed all expectation; leaves you in mourning after the passing of beloved heros, while still hopeful and excited for what comes next. This is quite simply not like anything you have ever experienced in the cinema. With undertones based around overpopulation, genocide and love; nothing can prepare you for the journey this will take you on. This is a movie that subverts expectation of any generic movie tropes you've come to expect from the genre; any issues can be understood and/or explained; Avengers 4 is almost impossible to predict following the events of Infinity war. The most notable feeling from the film is the complete harrowing silence and loneliness felt in the final chapters minutes of the film; 18 films of backstory have led to this moment. I have read reviews calling out the following points: We live in a world where the 18 other movies exist. This is part of a larger story arc and must be reviewed and objectively appreciated as such; you wouldn't say a book lacks explanation of the prior 18 in a series. This is a common critic problem, watch the previous films; it is common sense. I don't personally feel character development makes sense in this film. Subtle developments are seen through out, this is a journey built around chaos. The lack of understanding of the group and quickness of events occuring is exactly what is needed. The characters in the story are outwit, outsmarted and caught completely off guard by the events of the film.  The lack of development is a bonus, it is a realistic representation of what happens in life. Make no mistake, this is a Thanos story; to review it as something less than what it has earned because it subverts and doesn't match the expectation of the audience theories or ideas is senseless and lacks understanding of the bigger picture. I can say 100% after seeing this, the scenes were clear, present and relevent; nothing is vague or hard to grasp or follow. If you are watching the film, there should be no issues; the pacing is brilliant, bringing a larger than expected amount of slow and personal points where you would expect giant set pieces. All in all, this is a near perfect film. With any issues being trivial or meaningless and understandable given the scale. Are things missing ? Yes. Is it understandable why - given the larger picture - these were replaced by more important story points, yes it is. Would I like to see a longer cut, given we know there will be a large amount of deleted scenes? Yes. However, I can understand the priority given to the story and ensuring the most relevent points are made in the 2 hour 49 minute mandate.  Well done to Marvel and the Russo brothers. These film stands apart not only from the comic book genre, but films in general as something special, bewildering, exhuasting, tense, sorrowful but light hearted at the right points. Consider the bar for comic book films raised. This IS the best comic book film. Period. For all that comic book films do; the film ends up in a place that's unexpectedly poetic and poignant, with some truly harrowing scenes.  Watch it without the backstory of the universe and it falls apart, but lets be realistic; they exist, lets stop ignoring the universe when everything special about this relies on the hard work that has gone into moulding the telling the previous stories.", "Having been a avid marvel fan since the age of 5 and watching the first iron man at 9 years old, this film successfuly brings together the past 10 years of the MCU into one epic movie. It's fun and funny but yet dark and ambitious and it works all to well. It's what DC wishes it could be! Such and amazing story witch left me with my jaw on the floor and tears rolling down my face at the end. Genuinely a cinematic masterpiece of the highest order. Your not ready for what happens.", "***SMALL SPOILER*** I wasn't that impressed to be honest. The build-up for this movie was over the top, yet it failed to deliver. After making so many movies, each better than the one before it (ok, maybe not Ironman 2), I was expecting this movie to blow me away. Yet I felt cheated and lied to.  After months of questions about Hawkeye's whereabouts, we were told that he had a very special part to play, that by including him on the posters would give away plot points. However, the only thing we get is a passing comment about his and Scott Lang's location. Why not be upfront? Why lie? In addition, cast members made numerous comments about how \"full\" the list of characters was...anyone and everyone was going to be in the movie. I didn't know that meant counting extras, craft services, and production staff. How do you get out of having dead characters, the ones that have movies coming in the near future? To me, Marvel just jumped the shark. I won't be seeing the next one.", "I wasn't in love with the movie as a whole. It was cool but was just so busy because of all the characters. Thanos actually made the movie, a great character with lots of different sides to him and deeper than I anticipated. He was my favorite character", "Overly long and full of essentially nothing but CG battles, this movie has to squeeze in every character from all of the other movies into a wafer thin plot (bad guy wants to kill 1/2 of all life) - - - snore. Oh but wait, they \"humanize\" the villain by having him cry once... wow THAT' S SO DEEP, WHATTAMOVIE! It's so sad that children's stories about people punching each other are all that we get in theatres now... but the crowd had a good time, so if you love these MCU movies, you'll probably love this. If you're over/bored of them, this won't change your mind.", "I know this is going to go against the grain of a lot of the early reviews here, but frankly I thought this was a pretty dreadful movie. This one stacks so many superheros into the same film that very few of them actually get more than a few minutes of screen time each. Superheros which are all dedicated to protecting the people of earth, who barely feature at all except for a few frames. A number of well established characters are bumped off almost at random, and the now almost mandatory overlong, over noisy, confused Transformers-esque action sequences are weirdly punctuated by an approximately 30 minute segment in the middle where absolutely no plot advance occurs at all and which could have usefully have just been cut with no impact save to reduce the boredom. Coming so soon after the Black Panther movie it seems Marvel are now intent on creating some kind of endless production line of \"blockbuster\" titles 2 or 3 times every year. I am completely weary of this, as the story quality is frankly going through the floor like a bad soap opera. Just about the best thing I can say for this movie is that it is better that Justice League, but frankly that movie didn't set the bar high at all.", "Boring. I was in the cinema and bored. Want a refund. I prefer Batman", "Sometimes movies can be completely serious without needing comical relief every 10 minutes. I blame guardians of the galaxy for the toxic corruption of the marvel cinematic universe.", "From the opening moments to the last frame of the end credits scene, Avengers: Infinity War will blow you away. After ten years of films leading up to this moment, we finally get to see Thanos in action and he does not let down. Played by Josh Brolin, Thanos is above and beyond the best villain that the MCU has had to date. And when you get to the end of the film, you will be picking your jaw up off the floor as you will be craving more. And more we will get next year as Avengers 4 will be released.  I highly recommend this film to all sci-fi, comic book movie, comedy and action fans out there. This highly lives up to the hype and deserves its spot as the #1 top grossing film of all time.", "Here's The Lowedown on \"Avengers: Infinity War\" (PG-13 - Theatrical - US)...What did it cost? Genre: Fantasy/Comic\nMy Score: 9.1 Cast=10 Acting=8 Plot=10 Ending=10 Story=9\nImagine=10 Pace=9 CGI=10 Comic=8 Funny=7 The mad titan Thanos is set to put his end game to play...the destruction of half the lives in the universe. Can The Avengers and their allies stop Thanos or is the cost too high? \"When you said you were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world, this is not what I imagined.\" From the start, you will understand just how powerful Thanos is...I loved how this began!! The story played out exactly how I wanted, but not how I expected. If you are looking for something akin to the other Avengers movies or something like Logan was...you will actually get something in the middle. This is well worth seeing!!!", "Decent film, awesome villain, fun stakes/team ups. Not every joke lands like Drax eating those chips; awkward and went on a bit long...but overall enjoyable humor. The order is a lil one dimensional in a way but that gives more relevance to Thanos. Not the best cameo by DINKLAGE I personally was hoping for PIP", "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is awesome. Surprisingly, much beauty arises in its imperfection. \"Infinity War\" embodies the catharsis of the superhero tale of The Avengers. The visuals are dazzling; the battles have never been more spectacular or more costly. Despite having way too many superheroes in this 2 hour 40 minute experience, what makes \"Infinity War\" so compelling is the villain Thanos.  Charismatic and sad Josh Brolin gifts the amazing motion capture performance of galactic warrior Thanos, the hulking man-like creature Son of Saturn's Moon Titan. I agree with my buddy Marc: I get who Thanos is. As a child he watched his vibrant Titan die, due to over population; thus exhausting its resources. That was his epiphany. Thanos \"adopts\" daughters Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by Karen Gillan, on his merciless conquests across the universe.  Now the feared warrior Thanos possesses the Infinity Gauntlet, the golden mechanical glove with the Infinity Stones. When he possesses all six stones, he will have the power to wipe out half of all humanity with the snap of his finger. In his own enlightened twist way, he believes that he is benevolent. That is he for the greater good.  At the narrative arc of \"Infinity War\" Thanos tells Doctor Strange, master of the Mystic Arts and Earth's defender, played by understated and powerful Benedict Cumberbatch, of killing off half of the known universe with the snap of his finger, \"I call that mercy.\" Doctor Strange asks, \"And then what?\" Thanos replies, \"I finally rest...\"  Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo string a cohesive narrative thread with the inspired screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, wisely focusing our attention on Thanos. Thus, humanizing him before our eyes. \"Infinity War\" is great, yet not greater than \"Black Panther\". Where \"Black Panther\" was the self-sustained tale of becoming greater, \"Infinity War\" is more the Act 2 of the Avenger's hero morality play.  Even amidst the often tangled story lines of the rift between Robert Downey Jr.' s Iron Man and Chris Evans's Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor's displacement from his home World Asgaard, \"Infinity War\" is surprisingly and poignantly about the cost of being right; however justified we might be.  In that the Russo Brothers do the little things humanely: child Gamora asks her father Thanos, \"What did it cost?\" Thanos replies, \"Everything.\" So was it worth it? Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Evans rock as Thor, Doc Strange, Gamora, and Captain America - Steve Rogers are amazing. Hemsworth is refreshingly badass as Thor, fueled by his vengeance upon Thanos. Cumberbatch is quiet confidence and wisdom as Doctor Strange, who may possess the key to the actual \"endgame\". Evans always embodies such conviction and earnestness in idealist Captain America. Saldana is so powerful stealing the movie displaying authentic humanity in her love - despise relationship with her father Thanos.  Their personal story resonates above the sometimes distracting number of heroes and splintering narrative threads. So in the end was it worth it for Thanos? Does he get what he really wants? At least for me, I was surprised in \"Avenger: Infinity War\" in a great way. So it was worth it. Even with the totally WTF conclusion, I still have hope. I can't wait to see what happens in May 2019.", "I have to say when I rate films I am very sparing in my scores\nThey say there is no such thing as a 10\nI can tell you in no uncertainty that the Rosso brothers have delivered a masterpiece for MCU and not only is this the best Avengers but also the best Marvel film of all time\nIf you can't enjoy a film with Spidey Iron Man Thor Doctor Strange Black Widow Vision Black Panther Captain America Falcon Hulk Loki Star Lord Wanda and anyone else I've missed\nThe storytelling,the humour,the scene locations the seeing old friends,seeing the Hulk so weak (lol) the share will of Thanos(great casting) to complete his mission will live with me for many a decade \nThis film is deffo a 10/10\nWatch it and tell all of your friends", "Was such a great film! Thanos was portrayed phenomanly by Josh Brolin. All the characters had ample screen time, which I thought would be a problem for the film having so many characters. I had my mouth wide open for the majority of this film. Will definitely see it again in cinemas.", "Haters can try and bring this film down but this is a breathtaking movie which has been perfectly executed...and the fans know it. Thanos is the greatest villain in superhero movies. The action was truly epic. The film had heart, emotional involvement and well timed humour.  The greatest superhero film yet made. Seriously, how did they pull this off?", "SPOILER: The ending was unclear. The death scenes were disappointing to the point of unbelievable. To find out the main characters actually died the way they did with little emphasis would be massively disappointing to all audiences.", "After the premiere of the first Avengers movie in 2012, it is threatening its presence in the Marvel Universe. He appeared with all his power from the beginning of the movie, not disappointed. Excellent movie, the best of Marvel from my point of view.", "Yes, it is too long, yes it has too many characters all vying for attention and yes the story is convoluted by bad blood, family matters and missing elements. Yet it is still a must see and you will.", "This mashup of almost the entire MCU was a brilliant way to end part 3.", "I wanted to like this movie, but like The Last Jedi, I'm having a hard time finding things to like about it. If you haven't kept up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, be prepared to be confused. The last several Marvel movies didn't appeal to me, so I never saw them. If you haven't seen Dr. Strange, Thor: Ragnarok, The Amazing Spider Man, or Black Panther, you're going to have a hard time catching everything that is going on. I haven't seen any of those, and spent at least half of the 2 1/2 hours confused. Marvel and Disney made this movie almost specifically for people who have seen every one of their movies. The movie should have been at least half an hour shorter, if not more. I think, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a little too bloated for its own good. Too many properties, too many story lines. Using an overarching Avengers movie to try to tie everything together was much easier to accomplish during the time of the first Avengers movie. Now, they really need to pick and choose what to include. Just because you make a combination movie doesn't mean you have to throw every property you have access to into the pot. Also, a side note, with everyone who was shoehorned into this movie, they couldn't do more for Hawkeye than one sentence of dialog that basically said, \"Yeah, he's not here. Let's move on to something else.\"? Finally, I think the director must have taken a page from the Halo 2 guide to set up a sequel. The movie just...ends. We always knew there was going to be \"Infinity War 2\", but you could have done a little more than just fade to black. I always shake my head at the idiots who clap at the end of movies, but also like The Last Jedi, no one in the showing I attended found anything to clap for. You can do better, Marvel.", "Man! Some of you need to get of your soap boxes. I've loved all the Marvel films and this is no exception. Where is all this negativity coming from? Were those of you giving 1-3stars watching the same movie as me?? Infinity War is outstanding. Action packed, humorous, emotional and visually stunning. Ok, so there's teeny tiny plot holes (only mentioned by the pickiest of people that have reviewed this film and given it a low rating), but come on! It's a MOVIEEEE! People saying \"how could they subdue Thanos when he's got 4 infinity stones, that would never happen!!!\", \"Why did Gamora/Iron Man etc etc go after Thanos, that's just stupid!\".............reality check people. It's a fabulously entertaining FILM which has ended in such a way that was heartbreaking but equally gave us a little hope that things could be put right. Ignore the haters.........Avengers Rock!!!", "So much hype, but not good as it should've been. Not to mention the fact that it was incomplete. Yes, I know, it's Hollywood, but come on.", "This movie is a masterpiece, what makes this movie great is balance. Russo brothers did a great job featuring Thanos , all while giving proper shine to each character. This movie has no comparison. Never been a Marvel movie of its kind. After 10 years featuring the villain was a genius idea.", "Overall it was an incredible film to watch; I enjoyed every minute of it. I loved the way the different characters from across the films are all mixed in with each other in one movie. There is some great character development and Thanos in this film is just brilliant. A definant 10/10 from me.", "When I first entered the cinema I honestly wasn't sure if it would live up to wxpectations since it was commercialized too much but I was wrong. This movie is filled with incredible fight sequences perfectly timed jokes and a ridiculously unexpected plot twist. Almost every frame in the trailer is miss leading what actually will happen in the movie. For example, Thanos actually has for stones while fighting Iron Man. As seen in the trailer he does have space and power but in the actual movie those are along side reality and soul. Four stones combined there is no surprise even Dr. Strange, Tony Stark, Peter Quill and Peter Parker couldn't beat Thanos even with the Iron Spider suit that Tony had especially designed for him.  Hulk was a dissapointment however. We know Hulk for his strength, agility and impenetrable skill yet he p**sied out within the first ten minutes of the movie. He had a point I'm not saying he didn't. Thanos kicked his a** without even moving a finger with the two infinity stones but I really wanted to see more from him. Overall, the movie was incredible and definitely lived up to expectations and was filled with plot twists like Thanos sacrificing Gamora and finally getting ahold of all the infinity stones and *SNAP*", "A great first movie to the Infinity War. Another hit from Marvel. This movie just shows that the good guys don't always win.", "This is Thanos' movie just like Dark Knight was Joker's movie. He is the MVP. It's pretty rare for the audience to get to know the side of the villain and get to sympathize with his cause. Thanos don't want to conquer the known universe and be it's emperor. No, he wants to save the universe from extinction. He wants to stop what happen to his own home-world happen to other worlds. He wants to save the universe from overpopulation. For that half of the universe must be erased. Thor is the other MVP. Actually we get to see the full godly powers in this movie than anywhere else. Interactions with Guardians and the avengers in a delight to watch every time.", "Action packed superhero fantasy adventure. 22 (yes 22!) heroes battle the evil Thanos and his Infinity Gauntlet.  To become all powerful Thanos needs to gradually collect all 6 mystical infinity stones, only then can he complete his Universal genocide masterplan. The superheroes aim to stop him with their individual special powers. Dr Strange has foretold millions of possible outcomes of the battles ahead, his priority is to protect the time stone (hanging around his neck) but gives this up in exchange for Iron-Man's life. We are led to believe that Iron-Man is the key to ultimately beating Thanos.\n \nUnusually the villain wins and in doing so we see many important heroes die, in a dramatic 'turned to dust' way. However Dr Strange's time travel ability may bring them back for part2? We also know the individual instalments are yet to come. The film is long, dark and gritty. There are good character dynamics, humorous in places, emotional in places (especially in the last 30-45 minutes).\n \n3d is effective, so invest in the option where available.\nI really enjoyed the soundtrack as well. \nRecommended.", "Eventhough they go overboard with the jokes sometimes mostly enjoyable. Many people talks about plot holes and most of them are bullsheet", "Brilliant piece of direction. Each of the characters have been given proper attention and space in the movie. Thanos was brilliant. Probably the best part of the movie. Hulk was disappointing, almost reduced to a joker. Don't understand why. All other actors in the movie have done their part well. Hope Iron Man has more screen time in the next part.", "Avengers: Infinity War is finally here after much anticipation and it features an ensemble cast of nearly every single hero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It tells the story of how all of the heroes from the MCU must team up with the currently broken Avengers to take down Thanos, who has been searching for the Infinity Stones so he can use them for his own selfish purposes. The events for this movie have been building up since The Avengers' post credits scene. We've gotten a few glimpses of Thanos and his plot, but we haven't had a good idea on his plans. That all comes together here, where we see almost all of the heroes split into small teams before coming together and forming one large one. There is a lot of fun, yet tense action here; the opening, for instance helps set the tone, showing that this is going to be a much darker film compared to most Marvel movies. There are some high stakes that are fought for that could end up shaking the status quo permanently. Josh Brolin does a fantastic job as Thanos. Thanos gives off a very, very serious and dark vibe, which shows that he is not somebody that should be messed with. I feel as though Brolin did a perfect job doing so and is one of the best performances of the film, and that's saying something. You can tell that he had fun with his role, don't just take his word for it when he says that he had fun with it. The humor's also there and thankfully isn't too jam packed into the film. Since this is a film that fits in an onslaught of characters in a 2 and a half hour runtime, it doesn't try to fit in too much humor. I find it to be a good thing considering that it mostly tries, and succeeds in trying to be very bleak. My main issue with the movie, however, is that there is often too much going on at the same time. In the first act, (Which is pretty long since there are many characters to establish) the movie tries to juggle around 4 or 5 different plots at once. That's where the film can get disorganized and hard to process. It's hard not to spoil this film, but Avengers Infinity War is a fantastic addition to the MCU and definitely worth the hype that it's been given. 9/10", "Avengers: Infinity War was 10 years in the making. Every MCU movie since 2008 hinted at this eventual end game. The ultimate, cosmic showdown between the entire assembly of heroes, and an all powerful villain. Fans have been waiting for this, Marvel has been building up the MCU for this. Given the genocidal backstory, the challenge for Marvel though was to make a different kind of movie, yet remain faithful to it's brand of film-making, which it actually manages to do well. So planets are destroyed, and Asgardians liquidated even before the movie begins, while much loved characters soon start getting killed off 5 minutes into the movie. At long last, a villain takes front and center in a Marvel movie. For the last 10 years, Thanos has sent his underlings to collect the Infinity Stones. This time round, he is doing it on his own. The best part about Infinity War is that it is more about Thanos and less about the Avengers and Guardians. Unlike the comics, where Thanos wanted to eradicate half of all life in the universe to win his love, Lady Death, in the MCU, Thanos has a Malthusian hangover. He passionately believes his actions are imperative to save the universe, and goes about doing what he needs to do, methodically, even though it extracts a terrible price on everybody, including himself. Thanos: Daughter.\nGamora: Did you do it?\nThanos: Yes.\nGamora: What did it cost?\nThanos: ...Everything. So how did the Russo brothers sprinkle the Marvel formula in a movie that is all about death and destruction? First of all, they spread the action across half a dozen locations across the universe- Wakanda, Knowhere, Vormir, Nidavellir, New York and Titan. Then they broke up the heroes into disparate groups, and allowed their emotional connects and comic timings to take over. Other than probably Thor, Iron Man and Dr.Strange, most of the other heroes get a raw deal in this 2.5 hour ensemble set up. Even then, for them, these roles are but their second skin, and they do a great job, as expected. The result is a massive thrill ride, with it's own emotive moments. At the end though, even when severely wounded by Thor, Thanos snaps his fingers, and half the universe is obliterated. As far as the Avengers go, only the original core team (Captain America, iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and I assume, Hawkeye) remains in existence. Come May 3rd 2019, will it be one last mission for them? Will the Infinity War duology be like the masterful Kill Bill series- the first one being all slam bang, the second a more intimate take? Who knows given that Captain Marvel is teased, and we have seen Adam Warlock last year. And as for those who seemingly no longer exist- Spiderman, Black Panther, Guardians etc- fret not. They all have sequels lined up in the next couple of years. To sum up, Infinity War delivers a fantastic experience- on this scale, mixing action, imagination, humor and drama with a villain who you can almost sympathize with. The latter though is Infinity War's greatest triumph. I will need therapy to wait for Thanos's return. Avengers Disassembled. For now.\n9/10", "Although I doubt this movie will win any non editing awards it is a genuinely enjoyable movie.\nA movie not afraid to break off from superhero movie cliches, Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War is a movie that has something for everyone. Anyone who didn't enjoy this movie didn't want to enjoy it. Infinity War is easily the best Marvel movie to date with one of the all time greatest movie villains.", "I'm just going to say right now that I don't believe this movie to be as good as the 2012 Avengers movie. It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail. Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great! They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses. It's just one awesome action scene after another. Unlike \"Transformers\" these ones are beautiful looking and creative. ****", "Unpopular opinion: the Avengers movies have been suffering from the law of diminishing returns. The solo movies still work brilliantly, but the giant ensembles started collapsing under the weight of characters and plot lines right around when Ultron showed up. This one faired slightly better for a few reasons. First, the giant cast divided and conquered, allowing for A, B, C, D, and E plots - and each story worked pretty well. Second, they have introduced so many new (and funny) characters to the MCU that this edition was infused with some fresh energy and laughter. Buuuut...there were still too many characters. A movie like this cannot reach the heights of Homecoming, Ragnorok, or Black Panther. Less is more. So this film inevitably succumbed to being more about setting up future franchises than about the characters themselves. It was fun and intense, but I'm looking forward to when the stories get smaller and more focused again.", "Simply blown away and still processing what I just watched. So many mixed emotions and questions!?! Marvel has outdone themselves!", "Seriously! This is an action packed movie that you can enjoy, have fun, be emotionally invested. If you read a critic who making negative comments because the storyline doesn't seem too deep or some other stupid reason, don't listen. If you enjoy superhero mashup movie, this is the ultimate one. Doesn't get bigger than this. Get a popcorn and watch the movie. Most importantly, enjoy!", "Despite all the hype I didn't expect much from this movie - I was not a fan of Thor: Ragnarok, and the amount of the characters that were to appear in this film has made me a bit concerned. But as it turned out, I had nothing to worry about.\nThe film was a pleasant mixture of action, tragedy, and comic relief, as all the different characters interacted with each other. The screenwriters did a great job at blending more serious universes (Captain America, Iron Man) with the humorous ones (Thor, Spider-Man, The Guardians of Galaxy), and they managed to keep them at balance throughout the whole film. Still, despite all this, their focus was put on Thanos, and they found time to explain his actions and motivation - so much needed in a character like this. Marvel has a reputation for not having believable villains, but Thanos, as well as Loki, proved this wrong.\nAs for the actors, Chris Pratt showed he is the certified king of comedy, Zoe Saldana surprised by bringing out Gamora's sensitive site, and Josh Brolin as Thanos was just mesmerizing. Robert Downey Jr demonstrated his passion for acting and ability to blend with a role of Tony, bringing to it both seriousness and humor (you could really see he is the heart of the MCU, in this movie in particular). And Benedict Cumberbatch can act out just about anything. \nMarvel once again proved that these films are not only made for fans, but also by them- while watching the movie I could feel the excitement and dedication of producers as well as the rest of the crew, and it made me feel grateful, like I was also a part of the journey. And this is exactly what is so special abut Marvel - their films have that nostalgic something, where characters seemed like old friends and their adventures can easily be your own.", "I knew from past Marvel movies and the trailers that this would be a good movie, but it exceeded my expectations in every way. One big problem with the excellent MCU is their weak villains and the lack of consequences for the good guys. This movie brought us excellent and very strong villains, as well as plenty of consequences for the good guys.  There was lots of well-placed humor. Unlike the new Star Wars movies which can't place a good joke to save their lives, the MCU really gets that aspect of these movies.  I was wondering how they could make this movie without considerable violence...not our usual fights, but true violence. They didn't pull any punches. This movie is the most violent of the MCU by far. They didn't sugar coat this movie for the kiddies.  Thanos is amazing. Not just a mindless bad guy, but someone with a fleshed out character and clear motivation. Whether you agree with his reasoning or not, you can still relate to him because our own history has seen similar ideas from the Communists and Nazis. \"Genocide for the greater good\" as monsters from our past have declared it. If you are a fan of the MCU, this movie has everything you love from the previous films and everything you have wanted but haven't seen.  I give this a 10/10 after two viewings (now five two weeks later). I find very few flaws. Edit: A couple weeks later and I have to laugh at all the recent 1/10 reviews. The DC fangirls are waging a unified rating war from their Mom's basement in an attempt to drag the rating down to that of movies like Justice League. All the while, Infinity War races to 2 BILLION dollars and is already #5 top grossing of all time. Keep hoping for a good movie, DC fans. Nothing will touch this, though. Over half of the people who have seen this rate it 10/10 while 1/10 is less than 2%.", "Fall all true marvel fans, you will not leave the theater the same way you came in. Enough said.", "I had my worries going into this movie, as I know from experience that too much hype usually ends up with an empty feeling of what could have been. The Last Jedi for example. But in short, this movie was everything and more than I could have hoped for. The scale of characters, the visuals and the truthfulness to previous plot points was perfectly balanced. As all things should be. \nThanos is an absolute monster in this film, and while I disagree on Marvel stating that he may be our generation's equivalent of Darth Vader, he is definitely THE heavyweight of the MCU. \nI'm usually not the overly emotional movie-goer, but I caught myself shedding tears twice in the third act, which emphasizes the potent writing and vision from Feige, the Russos and Markus + McFeely. The humour is near perfect, with a single joke from Drax being a little off. Otherwise the humour doesn't feel misplaced, especially with the Guardians providing a lot of great comic relief.  Most importantly, this movie gives the MCU what it has needed for 18 movies now: Consequence. When a movie like \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" or \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", you think that a character is killed off, but then revived in the end of the movie. Civil War had hints of consequence for the main characters, but not anything spectacular. This, however, has consequence written all over it. The first 10 minutes is a clear sign of what kind of movie to expect.  \nI was fortunate enough to watch this movie in IMAX, which I recommend everyone with intentions of watching this movie to do.  I'm giving this movie 10/10 all because it has been able to live up to the massive hype and at the same time delivering an evil, dark, funny, but at the same time self-aware movie. And most importantly: Everything's at stake.", "The Intergalactic Dance Off begins! A spoiler free review will grant us the favor of the great hero Kevin Bacon from Footloose. Thanos, The Mad Titan, wants to take care of business and collect the Infinity Stones on his cool golden glove. With these stones he will be able to decimate the Galaxy and bring forth a 'galactic reset' with a lot less people in it. Up to our Mightiest Heroes and friends to team up and stop him but do they succeed?\n \nThis Part 1 of the conclusion picks up where the post-credit sc\u00e8ne of Thor: Ragnarok(2017) left us. Thanos makes first contact and makes sure we know why he's the ultimate villain. As of this point we get the usual mix of action; humor and pretty scenery that are the trademark of a Marvel Universe-movie. \nWhy should you see this? It's a thrill ride to see the conclusion of a decade worth of movies, your favorite neighborhood heroes and the best Marvel villain yet. Thanos' motives are explored so he's not just the 'superevil dude' but gets a 'likeable' background. Why should you skip this? 2,5 hours without break is a brutal evening. I'm afraid a rewatch would lead to boring bits so they should have cut some stuff out. If you have not seen the other films, make sure you do so that you get all the characters and easter eggs. You could be growing tired of the Marvel Universe, one of us had this feeling with Black Panther(2018). Avengers Assemble!", "Very predictable. Main heroes get no time to shine. Subplots are cliche. Despite some very good actors and, at times acting, all depth to the acting was stolen by the writing. Perhaps that was why the music was do prominent. So that despite my boredom I would know what to feel. I like super heroes, I can appreciate quality acting and action scenes. But this unimaginative writing is symptomatic for why so few Hollywood films are exciting.", "The reason i love this movie well there are millions of reasons but one of the reasons is that THE BAD GUY WINS like i love that its dark kinda its realistic in a way as to say that not all the time the good guys win. I just love movies that shows the bad guys win like this and revenge of the sith i need to see more movies or shows like it coz not all the time the good guys are gonna win i love it i inject that s**t", "Good flick with a steady plot and good family fun. Show started with action and kept it interesting all the way.", "Ah ~ah ~ a!Heroes gather to watch is very enjoyable ah ~", "The Russo brothers definitely made the best mistake ever because this movie was realistic in term of theme: the good guys dont always win. All these happy go lucky supergeroes with cheesy jokes get beatdown by the beast who is Thanos; so satisfying!! Although Thanos is evil, he felt what he was doing was the best thing for literally everyone, so he dominated. Believe it people: evil people get away with horrible things as recently as Epstein and as long as Genghis Khan and Vlad the Impaler. It aint happy go lucky", "The threat you feel watching the film with Thanos is probably the best thing about it. You really are concerned about the ending, and the constant action and fights throughout the film makes it very entertaining", "I just rewatched Avengers: Infinity War The nailed it. Against all the odds of juggling THAT MANY balls in the air, they pulled it off and it just gets better every time. It is imperfect, but it's still great. Josh Brolin is great as Thanos, he is a great villain!! Too many Marvel movies have weak villains. Not here. He is a great character, it is pretty much his movie. Continuing how great he was in Thor: Ragnarok, Chris Hemsworth steals the movie as Thor!! No mean feat in a movie with this many awesome characters. Robert Downey Jr is as awesome as always (when isn't he??) as is Tom Holland, he made me cry, it not going to lie. Mark Ruffallo has more to do than normal as Bruce Banner. Chris Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch are more supporting here as is Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany (even though I was crushed with there final scene) Sadly, Scarlett Johansson is wasted here!! She does not really have much to do. As usual in a Marvel movie, the action is great and it nails it's humour too!! One of Marvel's best for me.", "If there was any more CGI, they might as well have made a cartoon. The dialog and delivery was just cheesy. Given the massive variety of powers, strengths and vulnerabilities of the characters, there should have been plenty of the more human based ones that were crushed or crippled if they were subjected to the brutal fights. I get that it's a comic book film, and disbelief needs suspending, but this was just utter cr@p", "The only movie I've seen where the villain really does what he said he would do.", "This franchise as a whole would be so much more fun to watch if they didn't take themselves so seriously. Every male character has this stern \"I'm too macho to smile.\" thing going, they don't talk like real people either except for Tony Stark, they are so sterilized in order to project their perfect super-hero persona. Is the movie good? Yeah, but to be honest, I just don't care for the story, I'm just watching it for the action scenes. But I guess that's the norm for summer blockbusters. While the world of Marvel is fascinating, I can't help but find it ridiculous at the same time, when the movie is trying to set a serious tone with some kid in a spiderman outfit, it's just very difficult to keep a straight face. What I really don't understand is why Tony Stark is fighting in person, can't he just hire professional soldiers and give them the iron man suits? I'm sure they'll be far more effective in combat than he'll ever be. He should be chilling on a tropical island with hot super models, and if he wants to think he cares about the rest of the world, he can monitor it I'm sure. While the super-hero genre has firmly established itself in the movie industry, I don't think I'll ever take them seriously as other sci-fi masterpieces suchas Aliens and Oblivion, but I guess it's better than ruining a masterpiece franchise into the ground with Disney nonsense like Star Wars.", "It honestly baffles the mind as to why this film was such a huge box office success. I didn't like the original 'The Avengers', I loved 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', and now I'm back to not liking 'Avengers: Infinity War'. Firstly, I mean there are way too many characters in this film!! We have the original Avengers Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow and Thor (no Hawkeye in this installment). Now they've added the entire Guardians of the Galaxy crew, Scarlet Witch and Vision from 'Age of Ultron', Black Panther, Doctor Strange, War Machine, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Spider-man. (What the hell is he doing here???). Loki is back, although only for a (very) short while. Bloody hell, that's a LOT of protagonists for ONE FILM!! With so many characters I actually forgot about some of them when they were not on screen. I mean, Iron Man and Captain America literally were on screen only for a few minutes the entire film! They are also unrecognizable (Thor with short hair, Captain American with a beard and moustache, Black Widow now blonde...) It was way more fun when each character had his own film. Just like 2012's 'The Avengers' this film plays like a medley of superhero films, and not a standalone film. 'Infinity War' was also too fantastical with not an inch of reality. There was not a single screen without CGI and blue or green screen effects. It felt like I was watching a video game. The film clearly illustrates how CGI is taken much too far in films. Oh, so now Iron Man's mask just disappears? And Spider-man's too? And Quill?? Were all of their superhero suits designed by the same person??? It looked silly and felt fake, choosing the easy way out. I found the film boring. I hated 'Black Panther', so needless to say I didn't enjoy any of the Wakanda/Black Panther scenes. This was pure CGI and no excitement whatsoever. Iron Man's suit doesn't look as believable as it did in the first 'Iron Man'. It looks too obvious CGI. My favorite character was the antagonist Thanos, who was probably the deepest character of all, and I completely understood his intentions. I couldn't wait for this installment to end. Oh, thank goodness...But, oh dear me, this is Part 1 of 2...", "..and to me this is on another level. I just watched it for the second time not having seen it since it premiered last spring and it was as least as good as I remembered. IW is probably the most entertaining superhero movie I have ever seen and it's not just action. To me it gets so many small details right and I think it's emotional in a much better way than Endgame. Thor, Cap, Doctor Strange etc. are showing themselves from their best possible sides and I just enjoy it. And a few lines about Endgame.. I know I am in a minority here but to me it was average. Way too much about depression, way too little about hope. Fat Thor was terrible, the use of Carol Danvers wasted, the interaction between the characters strange.. Especially that there was no introduction whatsoever for Carol Danvers was a huge disappointment for me. Infinity War gets all those things right in a much better way and there are no such bothering \"mistakes\" anywhere. 9.5/10 and I am truly sorry Endgame didn't live up to my expectations.", "I want to give an expanded review but I'm in shocked. I don't even know what to say anymore. This was so great, beyond great actually.

Action sequences are imbued with emotional heft, and characters spar with the unique tone and color developed in previous films. Every resource onscreen is committed to bringing something larger than life to bear. Whether it is the cast offering individual and stand-out portraits of supercharacters; or the filmmakers involved in shooting, editing, scoring, and designing the visual and sonic world of the film; every element ticks with cinematic gloriousness and grand scale.

Even though the CGI looks very cool and gives you the illusion of being on another planet, I think this is a major downfall of the movie. Because there is so much CGI in the movie, it makes it that much more unrealistic. I know this is a superhero movie and it's not supposed to be very realistic, but I think they took it way to far with this. I believe that what makes a great superhero movie is being able to add those cool effects, while keeping things on a realistic level. One aspect of the movie I liked a lot was the villain, Thanos. I thought that his appearance was amazing, he looked scary, but he also looked like he had a personality. Thanos was the best part of the movie by far. He has great lines and hes energy was amazing. The main reason I do not like this movie is because of the ranging power levels of all the superheros. It is very annoying when three people will be against Thanos and not be able to do any damage, then one hero comes with one wave of their finger and knocks him on his ass. It is also very annoying how much power Thanos has. Everything seems so easy to him and he can just destroy anyone with a snap of his fingers. This is annoying to me because it takes away the fighting in a fight scene. It also makes the movie seem very corny, especially with all the jokes throughout the entire movie. With all the darkness that Thanos brings to the movie, you would think they would make the movie a lot more dark, and more of a superhero movie instead of a comedy. The fact that \"the entire universe\" is at stake, just seems extremely corny to me, they gave the villain too much power.", "I saw this movie and thought it was alright. Very much an action blockbuster with some moments which are quite emotional for hardcore MCU fans. I found Doctor Strange's character to annoy me a lot. Instead of destroying to time stone (which would have prevented Thanos from winning) he keeps it until Tony (who he hasn't liked all movie) is about to be killed by Thanos and then he gives up the stone. Essentially, he thought Tony's life, which he was willing to sacrifice, was more valuable then every person in the universe. Okay, that totally makes sense.", "Awesome movie - watches it at least 2-3 times. Best movie from Marvel ever - can't wait for its sequel End Game. Perfectly executed across all the superheroes.", "I am totally shook and mindblown. I can't believe how good and bad this movie is all at the same time. I can't believe they let the movie end the way it did but there has to be another in the works.

The only thing marvel fans go nuts on is the supposedly upsetting parts but it doesn't have the impact like American history x has in an ending.

As I suspected the movie just had to much going on between to many characters which resulted in a very weak story.  I'm gutted that you barely saw any of the hulk (my favourite character), but Mark Ruffalo did play his part well. I also thought Chris Hemsworth acting as as Thor this time around was not that great. But that might just be me. I also thought the CGI in places was pretty poor especially around Robert Downey Jr and Tom Holland when they where suited up and talking to each other.  All in all pretty disappointing compared to the other movies I hope it's better in the next one.", "///SPOILERS, IF YOU REGRET CLICKING THE SHOW BUTTON\\\\\\\nThe plot seems mostly summerized in 10 words:\nA villain boards a spacecraft, character sent to earth, mostly fights from here on.

Section 2: The ability to stand on it's own The movie has little character development, i understand that 18 movies are prequels to this, but if you can't write a review without using that fact, then you're not reviewing a movie anymore, but instead the entire MCU. So, IW has little character development, which the rest of the MCU has plenty of. Though lots of characters die, which is the least Clich\u00e9 thing i've seen in a while, there's more to a good movie. Overall, the humour was pretty funny by modern standards. Section 3: Villain The villain certainly isn't a bot, as thanos actually cared, he believed he had to kill for salvation, Thanos certainly isn't generic.", "I am a fan of the super hero's, but even the fantastic graphics and special effects could not forget the fact that this movie is just too much.\nThe story is chaotic and confusing, at the end either all the super hero's are dead and gone, or the sequal is coming. I think it will be the last one.", "I will admit I had high expectations to begin with because people hyped it up for me.  It was entertaining at certain parts, but didn't really keep me interested. I have a feeling I missed things in scenes that I would have understood if I knew all the background of the characters better, but watching the previous marvel movies didn't give me that insight. One of the things that annoyed me right off from the beginning was Hulk fighting Thanks. He takes a few combo punches and the just goes down. He doesn't get angrier and stronger, but just sort of slumps over. If they explained that part better it might have made some sense to me. Good movie to pass some time, but not as amazing as everyone made it out to be.", "Spoilers:\nWith so many biggies dying or turning to dust, and the time manipulation being elemental here I am afraid that in the end we will revisit all of the areas and deaths only to find everyone getting up and walking into another movie. I sure hope that I am wrong.", "Great movie, good to see all the superhero's in one film, the ending confused me, what's next?", "Goosebumps all the way.this is what cinematic excellence looks like.", "I think that since the original marvel movies (Iron-man, Thor, captain America,..), the movies have become more meaningful over the past years. I really liked the new spider man and black panther, and absolutely loved Thor Ragnarok. I thought civil war was the worst movie in the franchise and it gave me a lower expectation for upcoming avengers films (yes it was technically a captain America film, but I mean it really wasn't was it..), but this movie was so well written with some emotional moments, I'd totally recommend it to people who enjoy a long, breathtaking but also overwhelming movie. \n9/10", "I wished that the end will be unexpected and it was....\nI am sure that i will be waiting for the next chapter \nIncredible ending \nI was afraid to blink my eyes to miss any second of it.", "A blockbuster film that can't be missed and has awesome special effects", "This film features almost all the marvel's superheroes and it isnt personally entertaining to see all of them at oke place just for few moments. The most lifting factor in the whole movie is the character thanos and the background score here and there. This film is not so fun and entertaining when it is compared with many other marvel movies like black panther , spiderman,etc", "The people who are saying this is the best film of all time are wrong. This isn't Best Picture worthy, but it is a really fun film. It was epic seeing all these characters come together to fight Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, he was a great villain, definitely one of the best in the entire MCU (Loki is still better though). \nI recommend watching these movies first if you haven't seen any MCU movies yet:\nThe Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War. \nThose movies will help you understand the story a bit better. \nSo yeah, I loved this film.", "Wow just Wow. This Movie is a blast. From start to the end.\nFor me easily the best marvel movie so far. Also Thanos is simply incredible. Badass, but sometimes also a being with feelings. Best villain so far. This Movie is so good, don't know how they want to top it with Avengers 4.\nThe expectations are incredibly high. Dont understand some critics here. There must be not more explanation in this movie. Every marvel movie lead to this point. Every marvel movie till now explaint more than enough for everything. For me perfect movie, but i cant wait for the next part.", "I can not say one bad thing about this movie! Can't wait for Avengers IV!", "The movie was definitely quite fun and tense.\nThe film definitely used far greater quantities of emotional and cinematographic techniques.\nHowever I found that the killing off of certain fan favourite characters was simply used to further crossings for part 2, and didn't really act as a substitute for the insightfullness or uniqueness that makes a movie great.\nI really wanted to like the film, and I kind of did.\nBut I think it lacks the material to deserve the countless 9 and 10/10 ratings. For me it just doesn't compare to the top 10 highest rated, and shouldn't be considered among them.", "It's a mediocre superhero movie, and definitely not a good movie. The action scenes are so busy and cut you're sick after 5 minutes. The images are fine but FX are too much. Sounds and effects are very loud and all over the place.\nThis is for the technical stuff. Thanos actually makes for a good villain, character-wise. I'd say it's the only character in this franchise with a bit of weight at this point, and that's nice. But his plan is dumb and even his Death-boner makes weirdly more sense, but oh well. Then, you realize Black Widow and other regular humans are as strong as Cap, Vision gets nerfed to hell, etc. At least they have the decency to leave Hawkeye retired. Might change thought, sadly. And man oh man the jokes. More jokes than in freaking Deadpool. It's supposed to be the end of the universe for Christ's sake. The additional \"meta-jokes\" with Dinklage dealing with cringy GoT references are the worst. They're trying to add gravitas and sadness in the movie but you end up rooting for Thanos to end it once and for all. TL;DR : i was invited to watch the movie but if i could go back in time i'd have invested the money in a few beers. If you really have to watch it, watch it for Thanos' storyline.", "Mainly it was targeting thanos's life in a very interesting way , the movie is one of the best movies ever made about heros hope for the best for the second part", "If you ask me it was good and bad. It was certainly better than age of ultron and and in par with avengers 1. Personally I felt Infinity war was better than Avengers 1 as it was the movie we had all been waiting for. Thanos was amazing but some deaths were unnecessary and useless in the ending like Spider-Man and Black Panther, if you asked me they should have taken out the main avengers which would have been pretty dope. Overall movie was enjoyable, still don't know if it would be the best Avengers movie compared to Avengers 1. But I think infinity war takes the lead because of Thanos and the the direction. Well done for the Russo brothers. \nBadass characters like Thor who came at the ending with his new weapon and just destroyed Thanos's army. It changed the movie. I would have given it a 10 if the ending could have been better.\nBut well made. So excited for Avengers 4. The thing which sucked most was that the Black Order was defeated so quickly because they are strong and \npowerful. Damn!. And also that Cap was only there for like 20 minutes in the entire movie. But I guess it was by far the 2nd best marvel movie I would have watched.", "Rated by:\n Score: Mediocre and mismatched distracting from scenes more often than not. And the closing, final credits continuing music extends pain , increasing agony from watching the worst slow death performances ever in the history of movie history.  Acting: With too many actors vying for attention(I know, they had to do it because that's what they get paid for) I have to wonder how many cried for not getting enough credit for good acting. I have to say I enjoyed only the performances from Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Evans and Elizabeth Olsen.  Dialogue: For the most part \"very bland\", stiff and uninspiring.  Humor: Seldom effective but the good humor did make several appearances. But it too often seemed forced.  Action: It gave me a headache. With too many people in too many locations fighting too many people using too many techniques I found it too much to take.  Special FX: Great special effects when given time to appreciate the art.   Worst parts: Everything. I miss the simpler superhero movies when they used ingenuity and strength and morality to enhance their presence among humanity. I totally disliked Thanos coming across like Sandman in Spiderman 3 as the misunderstood crowned clown villain. I still found enough satisfaction to give it a 5/10", "Straight from the go, we get into this hurdle of unending action. One would be lost if they can't keep up with the pace that Infinity War brings into place. The last 3 MCU movies before IW have seen villains who strike as unforgivable and relentless in their deeds. Thanos, this comes in as the top of it all. I was impressed with the way Thanos was portrayed in this movie. Bringing together stars and getting the scenes right like a project slide really got my attention and impressed me throughout the movie. Thor'a entrance in Wakanda has to be the biggest highlight of this movie. This is not something any MCU fan should see once or twice in the cinema. Truth be told; MCU really impressed me with this one.", "Went to see this movie yesterday with no expectations and absolutely enjoyed it. First book I read was a comic book in fact. \nI found myself feeling like a kid multiple times in this movie. It is great entertainment. It has the feel of th comic books. \nObviously, this is not a Bergman movie and will not win at Cannes but it does an excellent job at what a blockbuster should do and what it should be.", "I was so excited about this movie and it didn't disappoint.", "Is a movie of a master villain with the characters that have been built up for the last 10 years. So for those saying there is a lot of fight... Please read the title again... Is a war.\nAwesome movie full of action. Some character development but absolutely up to the expectations.\nIf you want to see an amazing story with a beautiful image and nice sunsets in France please don't go watch this and save the time taking avoid how to shoot a proper movie.", "I was crying, cheering and then very mad at the ending. Every emotion experienced which a great movie should be like!", "Avengers Infinity War is probably one of the most anticipated films of all time but does it live up to the hype? Yes it totally does live up to the hype and exceeds all expectations. In no way is Infinity war a perfect film as much as I wanted it to be but it is extremely ambitious and one of the best the MCU has to offer. Avengers Infinity war finally gives us what we've waiting for so long, one massive event which brings all our favorite characters together fighting against the big bad Thanos. Thanos is finally here and he truly is spectacular but more on him later. Let's begin with the fact that this film is super ambitious. To fit dozens of characters and several plot-lines into one cohesive two and a half hour film is no easy task but the Russo's have done it. The film feels grand andEpic. The film could've suffered from pacing issues what with all the characters and several things happening in different locations but it never feels rushed or slow but just right. The visual effects are spot on especially when it comes to creating elaborate fight sequences and realistic looking characters like Thanos and his children who are all computer generated. Almost all the characters that we know and love are in this film and its quite awesome to see them interact. Watching characters that have never met each other before finally meet and fight together was like a dream come true. The banter between the heroes is well written and the chemistry between the characters is just perfect. The movie explored Doctor strange's powers a lot more which was fantastic but failed to do the same with Scarlett Witch as she does the same stuff she's been doing ever since Age of Ultron. Several characters get their jaw dropping goosebumps inducing moments that made the audience go crazy. Characters that stood out in this film for me would be Doctor Strange, Thor, Iron man and of course Thanos. Before I get into Thanos I would like to address one of the gripes I had and that is the children of Thanos, Korvus Glaive, Proxima midnight, Cull obsidian and Ebony Maw. These four looked great but there was nothing much under the surface. They were just mini bosses the heroes had to fight before Thanos. But for the most part I can forgive that because of Thanos is the best MCU villain ever. Thanos is great at beating the crap out of everyone but he was also a villain I could empathize with. He had compelling motivations and a lot of character depth. What's great about Thanos is that he isn't just a large strong guy but a character you can care about. Josh Brolin is perfect as Thanos and I can't think of anyone who could have done it better.  The fight sequences are well balanced with each character getting their time to shine. Creating a long and elaborate fight scene with multiple characters takes a lot of planning and hard work but the Russo's have done it well before and they did it even better this time. The comedy is present and for the most part is handled properly but sometimes they do manage to ruin serious moments with jokes that don't always work. Avengers Infinity War is a near masterpiece that has it all. From spectacle to shocking twists and revelations and a perfect villain. I highly recommend Avengers Infinity war and I'm gonna go with a 9 out of 10", "MCU has proved once again that they are capable of exceeding everyone's expectations creating a masterpiece! The way they succeed to work out with so many characters is unbelievable! Best movie ever! Congratulations!", "So here it is, Avengers: Infinity War. After 10 years of waiting, or 6 if you count from his first appearance in Avengers Assemble, Thanos has finally arrived. All I can say is that the wait was worth it. Firstly, the story lines are extremely well balanced. I could not imagine the difficulty of the task attempting to fit enough screen time for the likes of Thor, Star Lord and Iron Man into a singular film, however, the Russo brothers have managed to do so. They also managed to combine the 'right' characters in order to play off of one another. The snidey in love with themselves combination of Dr Strange and Tony Stark, to the humor and whit of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. They all blended and worked so well together. Secondly the CGI is quite possibly the best I have ever witnessed. Josh Brolins portrayal of Thanos shines through in so many way, not just his dark and gritty vocal work, but also the ability to show every single facial movement. Outstanding work from the graphics department for that one, Thirdly, the tone set from the beginning of the film. It immediately shows the power and devastation Thanos is capable of, and the audience never feel a sense of safety for any of the heroes again. Finally, and least surprising, is the action sequences. These action scenes have you on the edge of your seat from the get go. The heroes working with one another to try and take down Thanos and his 'lackeys' is some of the most compelling sequences I have ever witnessed. All of this action followed by a breathtaking soundtrack from Alan Silvestri. The only negative thing I can say about the movie is that it is going to cost me a lot of money going to re-watch it time and time again. Well done the Russo Brothers.", "This is by far the best Marvel move made to date, and I feel like I say that after each one I've seen but this will absolutely be a staple in the franchise. Everything was done to perfection. Action 10/10, Humor 10/10 (Well executes and timed), Suspense 10/10, Drama 10/10. You get the picture. Best. One. To. Date.", "Seriously, The only thing I compare to this is The Dark Knight triology, WATCH IT NOW", "With the 19th installment of the MCU Avengers Infinty war is the greates movie of all time\nThe plot starts with the asgard ship destroyed by the Titan, Thanos and obtains an infinity stone by breaking the tesseract and when Loki tried to kill Thanos Lloki couldnt get enough of Thanos and gets himself killed.As the story progresses Thanos takes power of all the infinity Stones including the Time Stone which Doctor Strange had and the Mind Stone which vision had.I shall not spoil ur movie movie and the end of the movie is purely amazing.This is a must watch movie", "Perfectly balanced! Russo brothers done a fantastic job. I had doubts how will they present all the heroic characters in one movie. But they nailed it!! Love you guys.", "Wow. Just wow! That's really all I have to say. What an emotional roller coaster. There were a few times where I almost cried. The detail of the movie, the acting, the directing, the music, the countless hours of special effects work that went into this movie.....beyond my imagination! Well and beyond my expectations of a Marvel movie. But this is not your normal Marvel movie. This is a HEAVY movie. Please see at your own discretion.", "The first 1.5 hours of the movie is pretty good but the rest of it is a stew of characters and cinematic scenes that go nowhere.\nComic book geeks would probably love this movie.\nD+ Grade", "The movie overall was great, and while I'll keep this spoiler free, I highly recommend that you go in with absolutely no expectations regarding character deaths. I went in with a mindset of who I felt, that I knew was gonna die. Now when it came down to it, and I saw how wrong I was, I was upset, and while I was thinking of it, I had no one to blame but myself, the movie was fantastic, and one of the best superhero movies out there. Please. Don't. Go. In. With. Expections.", "Ok so, the movie was pretty nice it was funny, yeah, there were very funny parts, but one of the things that got me is that like there are twenty two superheroes and they're so confusing nd you have to watch every movie for them so it makes sense. AND the thing that struck me the most is why I'm very mad is that the ending that it was reversed like its not supposed to be bad guys destroy all the good guys. And like everyone died and iron man was stranded, black panther was killed, a lot of other superheroes were killed I don't know how marvel is supposed to continue after this. Like if they're supposed to make Spiderman they need to make avengers infinity war two because how is everyone supposed to live like that only if that wasn't the real earth and they just fly back and continue their lives. So like it left me with sadness because now I'm not going to be able to watch any avengers movies. So please try to make avengers infinity 2 improve and get the superheros back. I know the reason that you made this movie was to get rid of the boring superhero and make room for new ones, well at least that's what I think because why else would you kill off so many superheroes. so if you see this, marvel, PLEASE improve. I need to watch another avengers movie. That's all. bye.", "I could not stay calm throughout this movie. I felt every kind of emotion possible. Watch this movie!", "Ive never written a review or ever really wanted to until it came to this movie. This movie filled me with so much emotion and shocked me than almost any movie I have ever seen. When I first watched it I gave it a 9 because of how much it shocked me and I really didn't know how I thought of it, and after seeing it a second time I now give it a sold 10. And I already want to see it again.", "I have never written a review for a movie, but this movie was so good that took the time to write and let people that this movie is the truth. There is not one moment when you will be bored, it's funny, it has action, good storyline, keeps you engaged at all times. Marvel never seems to fail.", "Excellent from beginning to end. Gave us not the evening we wanted but the ending we needed. Definitely a must see, simply put.", "Wow. I can't even. This movie is a masterpiece. It's an unbelievable culmination of the amazing 10 years that has been the MCU. It's an epic, entertaining spectacle with tons of great one-liners and epic action sequences, but at its core it's a very emotionally driven film that is gut wrenching to watch unfold.  First off, huge props to the Russo brothers for directing this thing. I can't even imagine the sheer size and task of directing this movie. Yet they pull it off to near perfection. It's a masterfully directed film. So many A-listers and characters and yet they merge all of the storylines together and find ways to get each character they're moments.  Now the movie may be titled as an avengers movie but this movie is essentially about the villain, Thanos. Yet Thanos is not an ordinary villain. He is an intriguing and intelligent character with a true motive. Josh Brolin gives the standout performance of the movie (which given the level of acting talent in this film is very impressive) His performance was great. I felt legitimate fear whenever thanos was on screen.  This movie was everything I wanted and more. It delivered to all the hype. And it set up a possibly even better and more epic sequel. This movie was so good it made me forget I was watching a movie and the intrigue and emotion I felt was real and genuine. I'm going to go as far to say that it's not just the best avengers movie, not just the best marvel movie but one of the greatest movies ever made. Wow, what an accomplishment.", "I am super impressed with the character development given to Thanos. Thanos had so much screen time which is something that fans of the MCU have longed for. Also, the cliffhanger at the end of the movie will keep you running back for every single marvel movie for the next few years.", "I went to the theatre and watched the movie on it's first day(friday)and I was amazed..this is what I absolutely wanted. I was with Marvel from the beginning(raimi's Spider Man)and after that the phrase was began with Iron Man.I loved it and still love it.From that I have never missed a movie of marvel.and I've waited years for this movie and finally it has arrived.\n In the movie,the plot is running so well and the main crew of the movie is arriving so smoothly.they made us lot of entertainment when they arrive.and when the Thor returns with his new hammer I was so amazed in that moment.woow it was soo amazing.when he comes the whole crowd of the theatre was screaming like \"yeah\" and it was the greatest scene of the movie.and after that they're fading away.when spidy fading away he made me cry.it was the biggest emotional scene of the movie.\n Overall I've stucked now and no patience for the 4th title.and I want it right now.love you marvel and this is a great job.this is the greatest comic book movie I've ever seen in my life", "It's finally here. He's finally here. As the Hulk crashes back to Earth, and Bruce Banner returns, he gasps ,\"Thanos is coming.\"  Back in 2010, Scream 4 was announced (Scream is my favourite horror movie), and I spent every day hungrily watching trailers and spots over and over, trying to figure out what was gonna happen. 7 years later, Infinity War released its first teaser and I had the same sense of excitement that came with the knowledge of a new Scream film. Finally, all the characters and stories would be coming together in one almighty show down of good vs evil. But just like the false starts in Scream 4, and the false endings, I was not ready for this. I don't think anyone can be. The action begins where Ragnarok left off; Thanos has discovered the refugee Asgardians and attacks them, hoping to get the Tesseract. Thanos is not playing around. The scene is barely over before New York is under attack again and that feeling of finality hurtling toward you doesn't let up until the credits roll.  Marvel definitely took a gamble and I think it paid off. I'm amazed at the negative reviews I'm reading because it truly informs how spoiled we are that this movie received anything less than critical acclaim. It is bombastic and filled with characters that over 10 years have developed, the acting is stellar, the various tones of the different directors over the past 19 movies seeps into every detail from the colourful and playful Guardians, Thor's off beat humour, Iron Man's cripplingly humane sense of responsibility, Spiderman's youthful \n and exuberant laissez faire, Captain America's seriousness and Dr. Strange's mystical mind melting graphics. It's all here. Not to mention the sheer ecstasy of the return to Wakanda. Black Panther may have just come out but there's no denying the impact T'Challa and company have had on the Marvel universe. What's more, these characters are so fleshed out and clearly defined that to see them work in tandem, and there are some surprising team ups, is just cinematic joy at a different level than I've ever experienced. Somehow, within all of this, there is even time to deliver character development and true pathos to characters such as Thor (whose story, on reflection, truly is devastating, even if he is a God), Gamora (Zoe Saldana deserves massive credit for delivering some great work against what I can only assume is a man covered in green screen during filming) and Groot, who has so little to do, and yet so much to do with the story. The movie, however, belongs to Thanos. He is present in every scene. Even if not physically, his presence is felt as the Avengers and Guardians do everything they can to prevent his goal of gaining all the stones. In all honesty, the movie should have been called \"Thanos.\" If Ms. Mojo was naming it, it would be \"Top 10 Avenger Fails.\" But, there are problems. Big ones, actually. First of all, if you have not seen many (and I mean many, not just a few) of the Marvel films, you may really struggle to join the ride. There is a lot of story involved and even though there is a small bit of exposition at the beginning, every scene is crammed with different characters with motivations that without context will feel alienating to many. Many characters are sidelined and it's hard not to believe that they are given lines just to remind us they're there. If you're a fan of Black Widow, Bucky or Shuri, check your expectations at the ticket booth. Further, it reveals itself to be a first part in a two parter towards the end which ultimately delivers a fatalistic and very depressing note. When \"Empire Strikes Back\" ended, it was on a message of hope. When \"Infinity War\" finishes, you know there's a sequel planned but that doesn't mean the writers should be let off the hook for how they end the first part.  Still, this is an amazing accomplishment and deserves to be seen at the cinema.", "This movie went above and beyond all of my hopes and dreams for the MCU. Everything you'd want in a Marvel superhero film and then some. The humour was perfectly timed and placed and the writing and pace of the movie was phenomenal.", "...it delivers. Boy, does it deliver! I'll see it several times with different people in Belfast, and will grab it in 3D IMAX in London also. It's worth it.", "It is a must see film that keeps you gripped through out there is not much else that is needed to be said about this film just go see it", "It was so good and keeps you on your toes throughout the whole movie. For me it was quite unpredictable by each of the events happening.", "The most hyped movie, and simultaneously the most justifyingly hyped movie of the year, it has the power to bring emotions out of nothing. \nThe last decade has been revolutionary for the superhero movie genre with the release of movies like dark knight trilogy. While marvel had been unable to create an engagingly emotional connect", "This movie is marvel at its absolute best. It strikes a perfect balance between humor and tensions. The last moments in the movie left myself and the entire theatre absolutely speechless. I was in tears during many parts of this film.\nJosh Brolin gives a fantastic and entrancing performance as Thanos. I found my attention consistently captured on Thanos in every scene he is in.\nChris Evans, Robert Downy Jr. and Chris Hemsworth gave phenomenal performances as well. The entire cast was at their best. However, Tom Holland was the one whose performance moved me the most to tears.\nOverall, this movie is amazing. The pacing and story are balanced perfectly (as all things should be) and cast is inamitable. This movie is one for the history books.", "So much to say about this movie but please allow me an introduction before I start.\nI love acting, I'm an actor but unfortunately not enough work as I wish to, screen writer and waiting for a miraculous opportunity to give life to my stories.\nBut for those who have the opportunity to show their art in the big screen, really congratulations, it's a divine opportunity so please accept my most profound bow, I really admire you all. About \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is a brilliant work, a lot of things going on at the same time so quite demanding in terms of directing to make it work, which I believe became a bit messy. An extreme high budget movie with a lot of big stars but it's just that, enriching with the presence and a few lines from each star because in terms of giving quality and purpose to the movie story and action, it doesn't, really. Becomes really confusing. A big number of good guys for a very small number of bad guys and it just weakens the good guys. There's so much opportunity to knock the main villain down and that gives such a bad image of the good guys because they ludicrously fail. Some of the heroes/ avengers in some scenes look so weak that becomes ridiculous. \nThere's a few bits of comedy which makes it a lot lighter and more joyful to watch but one truly unnecessary comedy was when Chris Pratt instead of hitting Thanos in the face he hits his partner's hands, when she's controlling Thanos mind and that was so lame that could only work if it was a comedy film, like \"Scary Movie\" for example.\nI was expecting better acting because that's what I crave for when I watch a movie. And more than anyone it's a director's duty to take that from the actors. I am really sorry Mr.'s Russo but like in football it doesn't matter the quality of the players, if they have a good manager they'll be a good team, and they'll play to win and make a good show. In \"Avengers: Infinity War\" felt like everyone was playing alone and without a manager. So the really good actors did a very good job because that's what they do naturally, and I stand out:\n1st the main villain in the brilliant work of Josh Brolin, he really knows how to react naturally and nobody tells him how to chew. \n2nd to stand out is Mark Ruffalo, doesn't force any reaction, he's love for acting is very clear and it's so good to watch. \n3rd Robert Downey Jr. natural comedian, and bring a lot of joy to the scenes. \n4th Chadwick Boseman, very committed to his role as black panther, very passionate about it and it's tremendously pleasant to watch him doing his job because he became totally the character. \n5th Danai Gurira same commitment as Chadwick Boseman and that gives the audience a lovely joy to watch her performing.", "A wild ride from beginning and leave you wanting more", "Good work marvel, very interesting movie. There is always action, always somthing happen. Like it", "Honestly,leave the hype aside but this doesn't feels like movie.The scenes are very small that leads to exhaustion from the audience point of view.Let the fanboys scream,but this is not a great movie but a mediocre one.this doesn't deserves a rating of 9.1 that puts it higher above the dark knight which is ridiculous.", "One of the things I could always count on in a Marvel movie was good would always win in the end. Maybe it's just Hollywood in a dark place but it saddens me when they bring it into a long standing movie line. I realize they will make another one but if I'd known this one was so dark at the end...sucking hope out of the room... I would have waited to stream it in my own home...prior to the next movie coming out. It's sad to me in today's world to not have the uplift one expects from a movie like this.", "After the over-hyped disappoint that was Blank Panther, I now get why BP was important. Thor 3 was so much better than BP, but again, important.  Infinity War starts with a bang and just doesn't let up. It has all the right snippets of comedy, tragedy, and some very unexpected moments. We finally get Thanos and understand why he is who he is and what he's after. All the MCU movies are tied in and, for me, there were a couple characters that showed unexpectedly!  The film ends with a great cliffhanger and you need to wait until the VERY END of the credits. If Infinity War doesn't bypass Black Panther in gross sales, then there's a conspiracy at foot!!", "I think that marvel is very smart , I advise everyone to see this movie you will never regret\nBelieve me", "This movie is so great and exciting from the very beginning to the end \nU will not even get bored for one second", "WHEN YOU EXPECT SUPERHERO MOVIES IT ALWAYS ENDS WITH GOOD GUY DEFEAT BAD GUY BUT.............

I dont want to complain about the plot, but right from the beginning the movie seems all over the place. We understand Thanos is after the infinity stones but the screenplay fails to deliver this story in a 'Marvel' way we are accustomed to enjoy. I really enjoyed Josh Brolin as the mighty 'Thanos\" - He is just perfect in this role and delivers a stellar performance. If you are an Avengers fan, definately see this movie but dont expect a grand finale, because this is definately not.", "When you watch it gives feeling to have Reaction for every part you see it , you want to shout and clap but I couldn't get the end one hundred percent but I think in the infinity war II it will be more clear", "So I went to watch the film with some of my friends and this film honestly saved us from the movies we're getting from Hollywood quite a lot lately. The movie is definitely worth the hype and if you haven't watched it yet, then you're definitely missing out. The actors did good, the plot is amazing, and i CANT wait for the next Avengers film just to see what would happen to those who have died in this movie and those who were not present such as Hawkeye and Ant-man. As always, you did good Marvel.", "So I refuse to give any spoilers because I'm not that type of person, but all I can say about this movie is just, wow. It had such a twisting, turning, roller coaster of a plot. This movie is very worth the hype let me tell you right now. Although this will be a VERY long year until Avengers 4.", "I love Marvel movies but I hated this Marvel movie... I'm not just disappointed, I'm really upset. They've spent years building up this universe and they've managed to ruin it all in one movie. I could make a massive list of the things that upset me but for my own sanity I'll just sum it up. Everyone was out of character - so much so that my mother who doesn't follow the movies could tell. Characters aren't as powerful as they're shown to be in other movies which makes fight sequences very frustrating. It feels as if the story was being made up as it went along and character development is thrown out the window. Walking into this movie I knew characters were going to die, I didn't anticipate though that they're deaths would be absolutely meaningless. I feel cheated, it just wasn't good story telling and no amount of shock value can make up for that. It had its moments (which is why I've rated 5 stars) but as a whole it was so terrible it's actually put me off the exisiting Marvel movies. I just don't know how they're going to fix this... I'll never be able to re-watch the other Marvel movies and enjoy them knowing just how horribly they end the journey. I'll let you judge for yourself but I can't see how fans of the MCU could enjoy this. I was in tears out of frustration. The MCU is capable of so much better.", "Over the past decade, Marvel Cinematic Universe never fails to impress anyone when it comes to movies especially the story line. From the start of Captain America: The First Avenger we as a fan base are introduced to the first Infinity Stone and the story gets much bigger and a lot more complicated. This is the reason why it is important to catch up so you can get a better understanding of what you are watching when it comes to Avengers: Infinity War.  After watching Avengers: Infinity War, it lives up to the hype and my jaws dropped. The way they portrayed Thanos (Josh Brolin) and the love for his daughter Gamora (Zoe Saldana), was more than good. In the scene when Thanos had to give up someone he loves so much for the Soul Stone, was perfect. You can definitely feel what he is feeling inside and it had me shook and brought to tears. Aside from that, they make him absolutely dangerous and even more, the most brutal villain in existence within the MCU. As he gets stabbed with Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) new hammer, Stormbreaker, in pain Thanos tells him, \"You should've gone for the head\" then snaps his fingers. It was Marvelous, no pun intended.  Including laughter in the movie was definitely needed, because if I had gone in their without some laughter, I don't think I would have survived. Since there was a lot of character deaths, including some major ones and a few minor ones, some left me in tears and eventually made me laugh in a different scene. As mentioned before, without laughter, it would be a hard movie to see.  All in all, the way the directors (known as The Russo Brothers) brought this movie together in a way no one can imagine. It is a reason as to why the directors can bring in an enormous amount of 40+ people into a movie and make it into something astonishing. All the hard work payed off, leaving me in shock but eventually leaving me happy in the end. These are the reasons why Avengers: Infinity War is a bang for your buck!", "This movie is just a great huge movie that make us in cinema yelling and screaming for every scene. These scenes make us surprising because MARVEL transport us from a place to a very amazing one. You was able to focus in all details at same time...you can't even blink because you will miss a very important detail....Thanos was great villains because you will go with his moods in every single moment...grafics and CGI are fabulous. Finally it's a marvelous trial I will experience it agian because it was AMAZING !!!!!", "Avenger: Infinity War is a great film and I think that the directors have mastered the ability to create films that draw in the audience and places you in the characters shoes for 180 minutes. The film is funny but serious and engages the audience, Thanos is by far the greatest MCU villain and in my opinion the greatest comic book movie villain (period). Can we talk about RED SKULL, he was the last person I would expect to see in this movie and also the last person I would expect to be guarding the soul stone. Thor and his new hammer (or axe), storm breaker has to be the highlight of the film...but he should have gone for the head. Loki's death seemed almost meaningless, almost like it was just an excuse to show that there not to scared to kill off characters...within the first five minutes. Gamoras death has a lot more meaning as it leaves Thanos emotionally damaged through the course of the film. Overall the ending was disappointing and left much to be desired, but I guess we will have to wait a year for the currently unnamed Avengers 4. The post credits were just a huge slap in the face (like Spider-Man homecoming), but the end credit scene has me excited for what is to come in the future of the MCU, and Captain Marvel.", "Im going to go out on a limb and say (BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME) Nothing could prepare me for this movie... it brought alot of closure and seamless switching between battles..... A must watch", "Cant really add much to the other great reviews but just had to rate this, even if comic fans knew a version of this would happen it will make u cry and laugh throughout the movie. The Mona Lisa, Sistine chapel, EM football 92 Denmark - of the MCU so far", "Amazing movie. I have enjoyed ever single moment of this movie. Every single cast member has done a really great job. Itsa fine work by the Russo brothers.\nHatsoff...", "This is definitely worth the watch. Amazing! I will be going again to watch it as there's so much to take in.", "This top part is spoiler-free I'm not sure where to start with this movie. I've seen other reviews for this movie that had titles like \"better than the hype\" and \"I need a therapist\"; I can honestly say the same things after watching it for myself. The action was almost nonstop, but still fun and engaging nonetheless (although I still appreciated the few slow moments it had). The plot was straightforward and spot-on, predictable in many places but mind-blowingly unpredictable in others. There was a small amount of character development, which is still impressive considering how this movie has way too many characters (but the writers and directors were able to pull it off somehow). There was a lot more humor than I expected, which not only made the movie even more entertaining, but it also exemplified the wonderful chemistry between all the crucial characters. Thanos made a fantastic villain, easily the best one since Loki. And something that impressed me about this movie is that even Thanos' top-ranking henchmen were insanely powerful, even when compared to the other major villains throughout the franchise. Even the thousands of mindless soldiers Thanos sent on everyone (more particularly during the battle of Wakanda) seemed to pack their punch. It was because of these aspects that we actually had real concern for our heroes, because they were all banding together to face off an enemy, and an army, that was seemingly invincible (especially considering how much power Thanos has with his Infinity Stones). One thing I will forewarn, however, is that if you're trying to figure out the plot and uncover the spoilers just by watching the previews, you might be on the right track, but the trailers are also fairly misleading. SPOILERS BELOW. Do not read unless you've already seen it or just simply don't care about seeing it. Out of the cameos that happened in the movie, Stan Lee's was funny as always (although more brief than usual), Peter Dinklage's appearance was somewhat strange considering how he's a little guy portraying a giant (in my mind, he's still just Miles Finch from Elf), but the one that permanently blew my mind was the Red Skull's appearance on that planet with the Soul Stone (I was disappointed to find out later that he wasn't played by Hugo Weaving again, but at least this answers the epic question as to what happened to him at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger). \nThe Russos had previously denied the theory of this movie having a serious cliffhanger ending that will be resolved in the next movie (like Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games, Hobbit). I'm not sure whether to call them liars, because this movie's ending can either be seen as a tragic end or the worst heartbreaking cliffhanger in history - Thanos wins by snapping his fingers with the completed gauntlet which disintegrates half of all living souls in the universe into ash. However, here's the ultimate kicker: Earlier, Doctor Strange mentioned that, out of the approximate three million possible endings for the infinity war (forgive me, I forgot the exact number he stated), there was only one way for Thanos to lose. After Thanos successfully obtained all six stones and obliterated half of all life, Strange mentioned that it is going according to plan. In that case, I would expect Doctor Strange to be the most crucial player in the next movie alongside Captain Marvel, who was teased in the post-credits scene. Out of all the character deaths that happened in this movie, I can expect only a few of them to be permanent. Those who were killed prior to the end (Heimdall, Loki, Gamora, Vision(?)) I can expect to be permanently dead, but those who were disintegrated after Thanos' finger-snapping (Bucky, Black Panther, all the Guardians except Rocket and Nebula, Spider-Man, Nick Fury) I can expect will return for the sequel somehow, according to the plan Doctor Strange had in mind (but the sequel might have even more permanent deaths). Besides, Marvel has already planned sequels for Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man, and Black Panther.", "Avengers: Infinity War was an epic movie going experience that will stay on your mind for some time. The Dark Order and Thor were awesome. Thanos is just a mean person. #bookit", "Wow absolutely amazing! Start to finish this film was so good. They managed to balance all the characters so well, with each character getting equal amount of screen time. Josh Brolin as Thanos was the highlight for me, never before has the MCU managed to make a villain so good and likeable, maybe with an exception of Loki in avengers assemble. I never read the infinity war comic story, so the ending was complete shocker for me, all the way through this movie, key characters are dropping like flies which is something the MCU don't ever do. I really enjoyed Thor, I thought he would be upset all the way through this with the opening scene and the death of my favourite MCU character. RIP Loki. But Thor was really great in this and he look amazing with his new hammer. As for the post credit scene, It did not mean much to me as I'm not a fan of this Captain Marvel, but the appearance of Nick Fury and Maria Hill was really good and hope we see them with the avengers again in the next one. \nAs for the ending we all know these characters like black panther, spiderman, rocket, groot and the others will be back, with the time stone in play that's how I'm guessing they'll come back. As for Loki, gamora and vision, there fates are sealed I think as we see their dead bodies whereas the others disappeared. This movie was defiently well worth the years and years of build up and lived up to the hype.\nThis is easily the MCUs best movie since guardians of the galexy in my opinion. And can not wait for the next one, I hope they call Avengers: Infintiy Gauntlet.  I give this movie 10/10", "One of the best superhero films I've watched !! Soooo recommended !!!", "This is my SPOILER FREE review of Infinity War. There are many things I wish I could talk about to make this review better..but I don't have the heart to spoil it for you guys. There aren't many people who hate spoilers more than me...and I won't spoil your experience for you here. I was fortunate enough to see an early screening a day before the scheduled release of Avengers: Infinity War with one of my best friends. I had fairly high expectations and I was pretty excited to see it. This movie delivers exactly what it promises, and that's fun with a capital F. One thing Marvel does to perfection is combine action, drama, and humour. It's absolutely loaded with exhilarating action scenes that often take your breath away, which is something Marvel always excels at. They put the pedal to the metal right from the outset and they don't take it off for well over 2 hours. But one thing that might surprise some people is how dark and dreary this movie is for a lot of the duration. You definitely get your humour that we all know and love...but this movie will get you emotional. It's extremely dark for a marvel film and it left me uncomfortable at times (In a really good way) You don't even have a chance to settle in for very long because your emotions will go haywire not too long after the movie starts. That's all I'm gonna say about that. The performances are all top-notch here. You're able to get emotionally invested in most of the characters and care about what happens to them. This will probably be a fairly unpopular opinion...but I'm not too fond of The Guardians of the Galaxy movies. I certainly found them watchable.....but I felt they were overhyped and nowhere near as good as people made them out to be. I couldn't really get into the characters either. That said, the characters from Guardian of the Galaxy are pretty well-written here and I surprisingly enjoyed them all. They all had a place, especially the complex relationship between Thanos (Josh Brolin) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) I was riveted all the way. They mixed in well with the others and weren't a distraction like I expected. Josh Brolin is tremendous as Thanos, I can't rave about him enough. I don't wanna write too much more...but I was very satisfied when I left the theater and so were many others. People gasped, laughed out loud, clapped, and were talking non-stop to each other after the movie was over. You can't ask for more than that.  When all was said and done, I left the theater very satisfied. It's exciting, thought-provoking, saddening, and downright awesome. I can't wait for Avengers 4. I couldn't be more intrigued by the direction they've chosen. 8.5/10 P.S...Be sure to stay for the end credits!", "Nice to see a \"villain\" that is not just an evil stereotype.", "To be honest there are many things which you can applause for \nBeing a Marvel & DC Comic book reader i would like to say :- In 1 line - \"Be prepared to witnesses this spine chilling story\"", "Loved this movie, the music is awesome, my grands were watching on Disney channel and it caught this granny's eye and I could not stopped watching.", "I read the original Infinity Gauntlet series many years ago, and while the storyline isn't exactly the same, they did an incredible job bringing it to the big screen! The action and portrayal of the superheroes was very well done and I was excited to see Thanos in the ending credits of so many of the Marvel movies. I knew what was coming. However, I was disappointed that Death wasn't Thanos' love interest, it still came off as exciting and fun to watch. Head and shoulders above Endgame for sure!", "The mortal's body is shoulder to shoulder, and the God's last true tears", "It's ok but people calling it a \"masterpiece\" is just wrong. A saying that I completely agree with is that less like a film but more like an event. I think the hype is elevating it to an unfair status.", "Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement. With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters. The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here. So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've. Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!", "Mind blown, well done Marvel. Captivating, mesmerizing and brilliant", "It is one of the best action thriller and suspense movie I ever seen .. hats off to the whole crew of this film .. lots of twist are in this movie . Movie is not peredictable . It was great experience ..", "9.5!!!!!!! As we saw mid credits after Thor: Ragnarok, Thanos is making his presence known!!! On earth, Tony and Pepper are preparing for their wedding,, Peter Parker is on a field trip,, and Dr. Strange is heading to the deli. Next thing you know Hulk lands in New York after being transported by Heimdall (while Thor's ship was being attacked by Thanos). Out in space, our beloved Guardians of the Galaxy are rocking out to some tunes when they come across some space wreckage and literally run into Thor. In Scotland, Captain America and company( Falcon and Romanoff) come to the aide of Wanda and Vision after they are attacked by Thanos's lackeys. Eventually,, our heroes all learn that Thanos is coming for the infinity stones, 2 of which are on Earth. With our heroes stretched out all over the galaxy,, will they be able to stop Thanos? Go watch it and see!!!!", "This review contains spoilers. Avengers: Infinity War is the third movie in the Avengers series and is the culmination of the infinity stone arc that has been hinted at in the previous Marvel cinematic universe movies. This movie explores Thanos in more depth as well as utilizing all characters in the Marvel cinematic universe to resist Thanos' plan. The movie is about the event of the infinity stones being brought together and the heroic response. Avengers: Infinity War is a visually impressive movie. The movie is filled with dazzling special effects in every scene. The sound is likewise at the high quality as the visuals. There is not a weak part of the audio and visual experience. The movie felt like how the Marvel cinematic universe should feel after all of the movies. Thanos' character design resembles his comic counterpart and he looks as realistic within reason as a giant humanoid alien should look. Likewise, Thanos' children have distinct and great designed that allow the audience to pick them out in a wide frame. The problems with this movie lie in its story and approach-ability. This entry in the Avengers film series is the least accessible out of all of the Avengers movies. The audience must watch the previous Marvel movies or they will be lost. There is not a single main character or group that is followed in this movie. The only character that is followed consistently with an arc is Thanos. He could be considered the villain protagonist of the story, but he is still not followed as in a classic movie. The movie starts with the cross-overs and anybody that is not familiar with Marvel characters will be lost. Each of the characters maintain their traits in this movie. The guardians of the galaxy have their character when interacting with Thor, Iron Man, Spider-man, and Doctor Strange. The flip-side is also true where the Earth's heroes maintain their personality through the dialogue. The writers should be commended for the writing these cross-overs well. The movie splits the plot into separate threads where the heroes try different methods to defeat Thanos. Ultimately none of it matters because Doctor Strange already knows the only way to win. It was predictable that Thanos would get all of the infinity stones. What was not predictable was seeing which heroes would fade away when Thanos removes half of the universe's population. The movie's end was unique where the movie is not afraid to shock the audience with such a downer ending. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is recommended. The movie is highly ambitious and is an interesting movie to watch for its universe. The movie does have some problems and it is highly recommended to watch previous movies before watching this movie. Grade: B", "Avengers Infinity War is the best movie in marvel universe by far. In fact it is the only one with very decent plot development and minimum holes within. This movie unlike other superhero movies have actually well done in the story telling and putting the pieces of the story together. Beside holding you on the edge of the seat the whole time, you ask yourself the \"How\" and \"Why\" logic-killing questions much much fewer times in compare to most other similar films. Also, the funny scenes and especially the emotional scenes are very interesting and are not only for killing the time and stretching the movie. Although, in order to fully understand the characters and relations you must be familiar to Marvel's universe, It is not necessary and you can still enjoy this one even if you haven't watched anything in Marvel universe before. This movie truly deserve the attention that it got and absolutely worth your time. So, Don't miss this one even if you are not a fan of superhero movies or only because you are not familiar with Marvel. It would still entertain you greatly.", "Avengers: Infinity War is a successful movie that comes with great actors but with overloaded CGI action and a thin story that was better told in the comics. 6,0", "Avengers Infinity war was the most watched movie in 2018, because let's be honest, everyone saw this movie, and apparently everyone liked me, personally, when I left the cinema I felt confused in the sense that I had to ask the question \"Did I like it?\" The truth to answer this question I had to see it again, maybe not at the cinema, but I did it at home, I analyzed it and came to the conclusion that if I liked it, but that does not mean that I loved it, I simply prefer movies as the first of \"Avengers\", \"Ironman\" or even \"The Winter Soldier\". Well, if you're a marvel fan, before you explode in anger, I want to remind you that I'm not saying that the movie is bad, I'm just saying it's not the best. Why? It's simple, the movie is very complicated, such as that they could beat Thanos very easily, like cutting off his arm with the portals of Dr. Strange, or that Dr. Strange does the infinite cycle as he did with Doormamu, well I think it is written like this, but that does not matter, the point is that if Doormamu a million-year-old celestial being got bored, Thanos by logic, simple would also get bored and agree to its terms, but the movie is not very complicated and they make complex plans so that in the end one of them spoils him (Star-lord), or that the film is complicated more also with that sub-plot of Thor in search of a magical dwarf to make his ax, and the problem is here, at Thor Ragnarok we were taught that Thor is not the god of hammers, but that this is the god of thunder, therefore he does not need a weapon to defeat his enemies, but here the film is overlooked, and contradicts herself by telling us that Thor alone It is going to be able to defeat Thanos with that Ax, which, as I said, contradicts what they told us in Ragnarok, or that of the end that everyone vanishes, I wonder \"Am I supposed to get sad for them? The answer is no, because it is more than predictable that they would return, seriously the people who cry with it, make me sad. Now I'm going to talk about how good this movie has and I want to start by saying that it's just great to see all the mcu superheroes together in a movie, which I have to recognize the writers and directors that for a movie with so many characters did not not bad, to tell the truth unlike other marvel movies, this one has a good villain, that would be Thanos, that has an interesting story, and a justifiable reason, that if you analyze it logically the true villains of the movie specifically the avengers , to avoid the salvation of the universe, to tell the truth the battles are good, the action is entertaining, and maybe previously I said yes, it is very predictable that the characters that disappeared will come back, but if there were some that did die of Truth like Loki and Vision, I hope they do well and leave them dead. I dare to say that the best of this movie is its ending with the winning villain, something we had never seen in a marvel movie. Personally I would have liked more is that this would have been the last film of the mcu, nothing like an unexpected ending with the villain won and with half of the population \"dead\", but I would only add something else at the end, to give an end to each character that survived, for example a scene that Tony Stark stays in the lost space forever, the heroes of the earth admitting that Thanos was right, or something like that I loved, because apart marvel was done doing the favor to close with a flourish, because the movies that have been released after this one are simply not good, \"Captain Marvel\" is the typical original movie, with an annoying protagonist and the movie ends up being boring, Ant-Man and the Wasp It is more of the same, with a villain with silly motives, many things that lack meaning, excess of humor, the movie is very bad, Avengers Endgame is not bad, but neither stands out in any way, the hour of time is boring rid to, and you already talk about this movie in a separate review, and we get to the last movie that Marvel has taken out that it would be Spider-Man Away from home and this movie is bad, the plot is more than predictable, the villain has again a silly and repetitive motive, excess of humor, love is silly and forced, Spider-Man is a fool in this movie, please enlighten me and please tell me what this movie is good about, because everyone I know love that movie. Well back to the topic Infinity War is one of the great events in the history of superhero movies and I am not sure if it is correct to say of cinema in general, with great battles, with one or another thing that does not make much sense, but a good Villain, this movie earns its 7/10.", "This is easily the best marvel movie to date. Thanos as a villain is menacing but still sympathetic which is one of the films greatest strengths", "Other than the cliche destruction of a major city, this is a entertaining movie. Grab your popcorn and drink.", "Perhaps the worst movie I have EVER seen!! From the first minute of the movie when Thor, Hulk and others were beaten up by a terrible CGI block headed thing (Thanos - terrible CGI affects) up until the very end .... horrible!  After 2 outstanding Avengers movies comes a movie where not a single Avenger was able to even win hardly one fight ... not just against the poor CGI Thanos, but against any of his pals either. Why are they called super heros in the first place if half of them don't even use their super powers?! The Hulk was in all but 2 minutes of the movie, otherwise we got to watch Bruce Banner run around and literally hide from the battles. Vision did completely nothing during the entire movie but stab one guy and then he laid half dead the rest of the movie. Groot just sat around in the background the whole movie with one part where he put his hands in the ground wrapped them around the stupid CGI critter and then died. There were so many characters that basically did nothing in the entire movie. Why were they even in it?!! The entire movie just jumped from 1 fight scene to the next. Not once did all of the super heroes get together and fight. It was back and forth, back and forth making it just a jumbled mess. Not to mention, it was just watching one group of Avengers getting beaten up to the next group of Avengers getting beaten up. One group finally had a chance to kill the CGI critter, but instead they decided to punch it and take off it's glove ... and surprise it got away. LOL Oh ... and beat up the Avenger group. Haha The movie somewhat reminded me of the second Thor movie because the vast majority of it was in darkness, which it made it very hard to see and follow. Evidently, they can't make good CGI without doing it in the dark. Poor graphics would be an understatement. The jokes were really poor, with the exception of about 5 of them. They must have taken all of thirty seconds to try and think them up. I will admit a few of them were good, but 80% of them were just rotten. Well, the movie finally ended (I almost walked out of the movie after about 1/4 of it, but unfortunately I stayed through it thinking it had to get better ... it didn't), so we stayed to watch the scene after the credits. The longest credits in the history of a movie by the way, and ... I should have walked out before the credits because nothing happened of any interest in the final scene after the movie.  Unquestionably, the biggest disappointment I have EVER had for a movie and just a completely ROTTEN piece of work. Don't waste your money on this!!!!", "The movie is actually 9/10+\nShawshank redemption and godfather/dark knight all of which are amazing movies due to the plot and storyline progression.\nInfinity War has so much more than that,AMAZING CGI,GREAT story/character progression,fast paced sequences,epic dialogue,funny moments,incredibly believeable fight sequences,the camera angles/quality everything is written and executed perfectly,this film is actually reached its potential and so much more.\nThe movie could not have been done better and thats why it deserves a solid 8.7/9.2 IMO.", "I won't say anything\nI know i would be hated just by writing this\nBut as far as i see, its the first time marvel wasted characters, can't create the dark and urgency of how dangerous thanos is, can't be bright enough to be the com action it usually is, and just ... that\nWasting some, overuse some...\nBut i do appreciate the cgi and the ensemble of actors and actresses used here", "This is absolutely not a 8.8 rated movie. IMDB you are cheating with us. very disappointing.", "This one was for the true fans. I can relate to those who have no real vested interest in these characters. It's a long, confusing, space war movie with cool special effects. But to the true fans who knew almost exactly what to expect, or knew what or whom they were seeing; this film is a modern masterpiece. The magnum opus of the MCU. What other superhero movie in a universe known to be free of consequence could invoke such a broad dynamic of emotion? I am a grown man, jaded to most things in this world, and I shed more tears for this film than any other. I also loved the humor. There were times when I couldn't help but belt out a hearty HA much to my embarrassment. But at times I could hear a symphony of noses sniffling behind me. This one may be hard for young children, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't see it. I saw it standard, but now I know that I need to see this in IMAX before the opportunity is lost forever. If I could give it 11 stars, I would. Don't wear makeup to this one.", "This movie will make you cry, laugh, and smile!! Literally every emotion you have, this movie will make you feel It; it is that good!!", "There are not many critical reviews here, so I decided to shift the balance a little. I actually like super hero movies, but maybe they have outlived their novelty value. This is just a bunch of ridiculously costumed characters with a series of funny (not!) stereotype lines and a single character excuse for fight scenes. After half an hour of suffering I stopped watching.", "Bizarre! I would like to unsee it. It has a few enjoyable minutes, but this is all folks. It is more a desire to join the characters from several movies than to be a cohesive and good story, like blending chocolate cake, bacon, pizza, soda, sugar, etc and someone saying: more, more, will be good. So, who watches ill take some small portion that is good by itself and I guarantee that the scene will end with a trash event. The quality of this type of film would improve if done with the help of the guys who made the cartoons.", "Marvell just threw in stars, characters and the sink into this without any rhyme and reason. To make this short? Why didn't they use the time stone to go back when they had the majority of stones and use them against the Badass? Simple, because there would be no reason then for 70 battles of prehistoric tactics. What a tremendous waste of money and time!", "Cualquier personaje pudo haberle ganado al villano, muy d\u00e9bil,", "Like I said, anyone who has rated this movie less than 9, has done it simply because they can't bring themselves to agree with the majority. Most of these are people with low self-esteem who have been at the receiving end of the world at large. Good to see, there are only a few such anyway. The movie is hands down the best movie ever created in the history of movies and that's it!", "A movie that's gonna be remembered for many decades to come. \nEpic movie. \nWhy are all the ONE STAR reviews most helpful? \nAre you kidding me?\n10/10", "This film could have failed in many ways, especially if the writers dulled the stakes, but that is the opposite of what they did. This film is tense, dark, hopeless, yet humorous. The film takes risks that will no doubt leave audiences shocked and by doing this alone has made it a revolutionary comic book movie. The characters, the action, the acting, and the setpieces are all done marvelously, and the villain, Thanos, is one of the most intense and frightening villains in Marvel film history and possibly in Cinema as a whole. Whenever he is onscreen you feel as though all hope is lost and that our heroes are in great peril, making this a thrill ride of a film that must be seen. I was not expecting what I got, but leaving the theater, I was absolutely speechless.", "Wooooow. Loved it!!!! Was disappointed that I was left hanging at the endbecause I Didn't realize there would be a part 2. But this movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole viewing.", "If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!", "Infinity War is the first part of the climax of the MCU, and it is absolutely fantastic I\u00b4m already looking forward to part II", "There was balance between explosions and quietness. I was sceptic, I thought I would get empty feeling like what usually I got after watching summer blockbuster movies. This movie is different, I felt lots of emotion afterward :)", "I really enjoyed this film. It's biggest weakness was its repetitive plot, but its character interactions were pure joy and the way Thanos was developed as a character was a delight. PROS: Great character interactions. Seeing these heroes from diverse properties finally meet and interact in such interesting ways was really satisfying. Well developed bad guy. Thanos is interesting and compelling as an antagonist with understandable motivations. Genuinely funny and organic humor. The jokes were not forced and were often derived from character development, not one-liners. I laughed out loud on several occasions. CONS: Repetitive main plot. Instead of building and thickening throughout the film, the plot was a series of redundant scenes where Thanos tries to get a stone and the heroes try to stop him. Less engaging action sequences. There were a few good fight scenes, but some, like the \"climactic\" battle in Wakanda, were a bit underwhelming.", "At some point the question of what do these super-heroes do if there are no threats comes-up? One thinks they are just ordinary people going about ordinary lives. Is that what you should do with these powers? Then, the threat of threats come and they all join-up to take it on. I get it. However, what do we do next time? How many times can you save the world? With all these other life-forms, different worlds/planets etc. and different types of super-heroes and their powers why all the fighting all the time? Leaving that alone for now, I remember the days of Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Green Lantern and the like who stopped burglars, armed robbers, rescued people and kept law and order. Boy things have changed and I am okay with all that too. However, how many dooms-day scenarios can we come with here? Take Thanos for instance. Okay, he's bad. He likes to kill and he goes after planet after planet. Why? Well in this case it is to find what he wants. Okay. What then? What if he gets it all? Now what? He can kill better, faster & cheaper? It doesn't compute. One other annoying thing that comes up in the dialog is the expression OMG or oh my God. If super-heroes are uttering this then there must be a God and if so HE is all powerful exceeding the whole movie premise. That phrase called me back to reality and these movies could do with out it because it doesn't work well in make-believe worlds. \nAll this aside, the theaters were packed, people were rushing in, everyone had their snacks, drinks and pleasant company and apparently we the public like this stuff. It all works rather well if one considers it is all only in the Marvel Universe and the viewers must leave their real Universe behind to visit there. Same with the DC world too. Some of the stories are really far-out stretching it to the max. What do you get a billionaire for Xmas comes to mind? They got it all. Same with us viewers. What's next? Beware of....", "This film, is about the avengers trying to stop the unstoppable force of Thanos, from destroying half if the universe. This film is directed by Anthony Russo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and Joe Russo (Captain America: The Winter soldier). It has a huge cast, which include Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chris Hemsworth (The Avengers) and Mark Ruffalo (The Avengers). To name a few. I love this film, I don't think it is as good as Black Panther, simply because Black Panther destroyed all my expectations, to be absolutely brilliant, Whilst this lived up to my hype, so I didn't have as much of a payoff. But that is the only reason why. The Russo brothers deliver yet again a beautiful film, with much less shaky cam than there other 2 MCU films. all of the performances are great, but the stand out is defiantly Josh Brolin (No country for old men) as the big bad Thanos. Everything about this film is absolutely fantastic, Watch it! So far this year, Marvel has knocked it out the park. First Black Panther now this. Fingers crossed for Ant-Man and The Wasp. 10/10", "Wow,just wow.  I was so thrilled going into the cinema, expecting great action, amazing visuals, funny jokes, and it delivered. This has to be the best marvel movie i have watched so far! IM STILL PUMPED I CANT SLEEP!", "This movie was pretty much what I expected it to be. 2 movies squeezed into one or at least a lot cut away. There were too many fast cuts to count and about halfway I was constantly wondering where are we now. A lot of action with (unnecessary)feels parts in between.\nThere were a huge cast but it was handled better than in Captain America Civil War.\nHumour was mostly ok and too excessive. I suppose it's not bad. At the very least time flew a lot faster than in some previous Marvel movies.", "There is nothing but flashy images and superficial dialogues. Having a score of 8,5 is just an insult to the art that it filmography. Scorcese was right, this is not cinema.", "It's a action movie for 12 year old with no real plot. Everytime the movie wants to be funny, it is more embarrassing than anything else. I don't know why I give even 3 stars for this. Probably because of my respect for the 12 year-old, who like that movie.", "Hilarious man baby basement dwelling tasteless fools.", "I really wanted to like this movie, believe me I did, but there were several problems with the movie. Firstly, Star Lord, I mean really? They had Thanos subdued, and then Star Lord finds Gamora is dead, and he goes all nuts, this to me was a really ridiculous thing to do. Also the movie was kind of boring until the end, I found the action kind of generic, and like the other MCU movies. Thanos, I found to be a very good villain, like Loki or Killmonger, and some of the interactions between the characters amusing but on the whole, I found the movie did not live up to its hype, and I think it could have been done a little better.", "From around 50 movies of 2018 this is the movie that made me agry watching. Probably because Ive seen Seven Samurai, Lord of the Rings, Mad Max etc and I cant agree that the level of action movies should fall in this level. From start to finish cgi was the only good aspect of this movies. Those who like it are probably teens. There was a critic who said this movie puts the Hollywood in danger and he is right. Critics gave this an average of 6.8 in Metascore, though it doesnt even deserve that.", "Just my opinion take that as you will, or just tell how wrong i am in the comments.", "Flaws and loopholes. Few of the jokes are plain and unnatural.", "What a snooze-fest. Thankfully Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsowrth lifted the mood with their occasional humour but the weakest offering from the franchise by far and it was already a low bar. A bad guy that looks like he's suffering 'roid-rage', a protracted assembly of the various marvel characters and a finale that leaves me wanting less\nSpoiler-alert, this is tosh", "This is the full live-action film debut of Thanos(voice-acted by Josh Brolin of No Country For Old Men fame). The film's plot seems heavily inspired from the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. Namely: The Lord Of The Rings. Plot: Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment..  This movie like all the other movies before it relies heavily on modern C.G.I. graphics. These days Hollywood movies use C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) like a crippled man uses his crutches. And also beefed up sound-effects... All the actors play their roles as programmed R.P.G. characters play out in a video game. There is a lack of casting and acting talent these days in Hollywood. Indeed this era is the most uninspiring compared to the legendary 80's era, where some of the greatest movie to ever grace the silver screen were made.  Verdict: I would recommend this film as a time-pass sort of movie where you have nothing to do but kill time(figuratively speaking).", "It is the best movie among avengers ..infact I consider it best movie of MCU", "This is everything I wanted it to be and more. Will go down as the greatest cinematic event till next year when we do it all again", "I cant understand how any movie fan in world can give this movie 1 in score?i think people that do that should be banned from scoring movies.its a well made and a very good super hero movie", "In my opinion it's incredibly overhyped and overrated. It's just another one of those flashy 21st century marvel movies, but longer and with more emotional moments I guess. And more characters, which makes it quite messy to me. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of this genre.", "Avengers Infinity War is the definition of mania. Everything just finally unravels on screen and it certainly messes with your mentality if you've been sticking around with the franchise for the past ten years. I'm more than pleased with this exhilarating MCU flick. (Verdict: A)", "To all the reviewers who are giving this a 1 star because \"this has too much visual effects\" and \"not enough character development\" This review is for you! Avengers Infinity War consists of a talking raccoon, a humanoid tree, a dude that turns green that weighs about 1000lbs of muscle, a mad Titan from a completely different planet a floating wizard. Some of the scenes occur on different planets, in space, and on a spaceship. So when you complain about this movie having too much visual effects, unfortunately you just failed to understand the movie itself. Now to address the complaints about the lack of character development, if you knew anything about character development, these characters developed from different movies, Captain America in Captain America: the first avenger, Ironman in the first Ironman movie, formation of Guardians of the Galaxy in their own movie, Dr. Strange from his own movie and all the sidekicks were all introduced on other Marvel movies so all these characters are well developed. Avengers Infinity War was never made to develop characters, it is the culmination of these characters to fight a super villain. So if you're gonna criticize this movie because it lacks character development and its nothing but visual effects, KID, you have no clue what you are talking about.", "Best marvel movie yet, been watching their movies for ten years and they still manage to blow my mind.", "Best marvel movie of all marvel movies. This movie does not disappoint. I had really high expectations going in and when I left the theater, this movie blew way past my expectations. Absolutely amazing how they pieced everything together. A little bit of suspense, comedy, drama. Overall this is just an amazing movie. When I said the best marvel movie, it is literally the best marvel movie out there even if you included the fox family. I gave it a 10 because it was very well deserved. I really wished the mutants played roles on this movie just like the comics but unfortunately fox is in the way. Even though the lack of mutants divided the MCU I still feel obligated to give it a 10 because it most certainly deserved it. great job to all who worked on this movie. This is probably not part of the review but I saw a very old couple watching this movie, like I mean 80 years old old and this just shows how marvel comics and the characters created transcends generations after generations which is great because it brings everyone together.", "I have been anticipating this film for an enjoyable MCU 10 years.\nI was a little concerned as I wasn't overly impressed with the rather lackluster Black Panther (or the Lion King retelling) which suffered from over enthusiastic use of obvious CGI and suffered a Mary Sue character (T'Challa's sister if you hadn't guessed) However Infinity War was absolutely EPIC. Finally a decent MCU villain, fully rounded, deep and gained my sympathy despite my best intentions.\nA fair few surprises and an absolutely storming finale. I get the feeling Ant Man and the Wasp is going to struggle fill the gap to Infinity War 2 (or whatever it's called).", "Regardless of how long it took to film, its the best heromovie out there. Lots of action-packed scenes but also very real. Credits to the masters", "Probaly this is one of the best action movie of the year,but for me what makes this film special is to see Spidey's crybaby's face when he says he doesn't want to die,and also to see Hulk being too affraid to show up after he is beated by Thanos.Also Iron Man looks great after Thanos leaves him alive and butthurt.", "A culmination of 18 movies,10 years and a ton of characters from the comics all lead to this. A spectacular visual marvel with a fast storytelling and good ol' comic book action. Thanos most definitely is the main protagonist of this movie and has been done justice in the hands of the Russos. A satisfying screen time for most and doses of unexpected events that would shock even the most veteran comic fans/movie goers. The boldest MCU movie by far and a proper comic book movie.\nInfinity war is not for the casual movie goers,its a love letter to all those who stayed for the last 10 years.", "If you love Iron Man, Thor and Strange then you should watch this movie. The movie has some pretty good fight scenes with Thanos. Thanos lived up to the expectation of being top villain in the MCU. I really enjoyed this movie.", "Non stop action and a roller coaster ride, best Marvel movie!", "I don't know how a superhero sci-fi action film can be any more entertaining than this. It was such a well-paced, well-scripted film which was filled to the brim with excitement and had just a dash of humor. The story never once seemed too big for the directors to convey or the characters to portray considering the end of the universe was at stake. Credit the Russo brothers for their vision and the cast for an incredible delivery. Marvel set the bar so extremely high here that its hard to expect anything more than disappointment when Part 2 rolls out in 2019. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully I'm wrong. Because I sure can't wait to conclude this epic tale of triumph and destruction come next year. Once again Marvel, your hold on the cinematic universe has just become stronger than Thanos's grip inside the Infinity Gauntlet.", "This movie did everything, what superhero movie should do. I love the third act and every action scene. Some characters didn't get much screen time than others, but hey thats understandable, because in this film there are so many characters.\nThis movie gets 10/10", "Picking up right where Thor: Ragnarok leaves off, Avengers: Infinity War never takes a break. The emotional blows come just as early as we say goodbye to Heimdall and fan-favorite Loki. An amazing performance from Josh Brolin as Thanos left me terrified for every single character that he shared the screen with. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent as always, this time teaming with Tom Holland's Spider-Man, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, and most of the Guardians. Chris Hemsworth makes you fall in love with Thor even more as he works alongside Rocket Raccoon and Teenage Groot. I wish Chris Evans had a bigger role in this film as Steve Rodgers, but in a movie this crowded, its a wonder this film ever even worked. I loved the fact that Marvel Studios made Thanos the main character of this film. He was easily the best villain we've ever seen in a Marvel film (sorry Killmonger). After he snaps his fingers, we watch helplessly as our heroes start to disappear. Tom Holland delivers a gut-wrenching performance in his \"death\" scene, and though I know he'll return, it broke my heart to watch my favorite superhero from the time I was little go out that way. This has left me dreading the next Avengers film, but not because I think it will be bad. I am in fear of exactly what will happen to my favorite heroes when they try to \"avenge\" the Earth and once again take on Thanos.", "So much fun to watch....I wanna see it again ASAP! Also, they did a fantastic job making a story with so many superheroes.", "Okay so i have never been a fan of the MCU because it was never as intense as i wanted my movies to be and because it always seemed like they didn't direct this movie for a comic geek like me,but rather for children(as Disney does)\nWell,this one was for me !\nI dont think this movie can really be reviewed or compared,because it has no peers.It was a roller coaster ride and i was left wide eyed and grasping at my seat the WHOLE movie,THIS is what 10 years of building can accomplish,and i think every comic book enthusiast should watch this movie,it doesn't get any better.\nNow for some reason i appreciate the rest of the MCU movies so much more.", "What can i say? It's really fantastic. I love you Thanos!! He is so perfect. I'm waiting Avangers 4 with a great wonder. See you in 2019 Thanos..", "SPOILER: Saw it Friday night with my son.  Gotta say, never a dull moment in this one and I never felt overwhelmed which surprised me with about a thousand cast members in this one. Great job introducing the bad guy as a real imposing fella. Then an interesting kind of twist making him seem not so bad as they revealed his story. Some seriously funny lines in this one. Had me laughing out loud at the theater.  My son says he wants to buy it. It will be interesting to see where they go from here. Can't wait for part II. We (and EVERYONE at the theater) stayed throughout the credits to get our Marvel tidbit. Not worth the LONG wait...  Really enjoyed this one. All characters seemed to have a significant role. Even Groot got a shining moment. A couple surprisingly moving moments among all the whizzbang stuff. D.C. really has an uphill battle now. I still don't know who that gal with the power to destroy an infinity stone is. But Spiderman can't remember names either :D I really don't like Zoe as Garmora; the only chink in the Marvel armor here IMO. But I still give it a 10. I don't know what more you could have asked for. Well done.", "Avengers: Infinity War left a lot of unexpected impressions on me as I watched it. It achieved some cinematic \"firsts\" for this long-time movie fan. Possible spoilers ahead. I can't believe that after watching this movie, I can name all six Infinity Stones, and the order in which Thanos got them, and who he got them from (at least the ones he got in this movie). That is a crazy level of trivial detail but the movie left that much of an impression on me and the plot was so organically developed. It's like remembering every city that Indy traveled to in search of the Ark and in what order. Maybe I could do that after 35 years of viewing, but not after the first watch! I didn't have a lot of interest going into this movie because I wasn't a huge fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy (at least not Vol 1; I started out liking Vol 2 much better but it got kind of uber violent and I never finished it). I didn't really want to see the GotG interact with my favorite Marvel heroes like Captain America or Spider-Man.  But the GotG's interactions with Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Dr. Strange were awesome. The GotG were great in this movie. Mad respect to Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Quinn, Groot, and the rabbit. Speaking of Thor and Dr. Strange... Avengers: Infinity War made me want to go back and catch up on some of their backstories that I missed. I missed Ragnarok and The Dark World and now I need to see them. I didn't like Dr. Strange's origin movie but I didn't really pay attention to it - kind of slept through it and now I want to watch it again, given Dr. Strange's pivotal role in this film. For the 19th film in a series to somehow retroactively make earlier entries more relevant and interesting is an amazing feat! Just when I was wondering how they were going to work Black Panther into the plot - Boom! They go to Wakanda. Yes, the big battle in Wakanda was a bit reminiscent of the battle in The Phantom Menace, but it was still exciting. Normally I don't like Thor and his godlike mega weapons, but he dang sure needed that \"dwarf\"-forged Stormbreaker axe this time. And still it wasn't enough. This was the quietest I've ever heard a movie theater. I went late at night on its 2nd weekend out but still there was a mix of families, couples, children, older people, etc. and everyone was quiet the entire film (except for some laughs at the clever humor). The audience was completely engrossed in the movie.  The humor and wit worked well. As others have noted, it seemed much more organic and less forced than in other MCU movies, and helped balance the more serious scenes.  OK, 3D is kind of unnecessary. Not enough occurs in 3D to make it worth the extra price. Also, there is a lot of quick editing in some of the fight scenes, but that's kind of typical for these films now. It's been done worse before and doesn't detract from the film too much.  I didn't even recognize Steve Rogers with the beard and all-black suit. I was like \"Oh, that's not Hawkeye... Who is this guy? Did I miss an origin movie?\" I liked that it took me a few minutes to figure it out.  Nice homage to the \"Ming the Merciless tribute scene\" from 1980's Flash Gordon at the start of A:IW. Too bad Loki got the Prince Thun treatment.  Thank you, Hulk, for getting your ass whupped at the start and then refusing to show up for the rest of the movie. I'm sure it was a better movie for it since you're kind of overplayed. I wonder how many people will watch this movie and sit there and think \"Is Thanos right?\" That's scary - especially 'cause I was one of them. Of course, nobody wants to be in the wiped-out half of the universe. Speaking of that, a lot of quality heroes got dusted in the end of that movie. Way more than half. That's scary, I can't wait to see how they come back.  The after-credits scene is mandatory viewing, but now I gotta research to see whose logo was on Nick Fury's pager. Too bad it wasn't the Fantastic 4. They could use a serious reboot. Final thought: GIANT DINKLAGE!! 'Nuff Said!!", "If you're not a fan of this universe of if you haven't seen the other movies, you're probably not going to like it. There isn't a whole lot of character development because all these characters have already been developed and established in other movies. If you haven't seen the other movies before watching this one, then you're probably going to be a bit confused concerning everyone's motivations. Except for Thanos. This is basically his movie. Thanos is a giant middle finger to everyone who says that supervillians can't be good as he is probably one of the best villains that I've ever seen. Though this movie may be long, it is extremely fast-paced. The graphics are all incredible (though there are a few minor shots that probably aren't going to hold up well). This movie keeps you watching with all the different well-executed subplots. Though the script could've been a bit better at times, the action is phenomenal. The boundaries between reality and imagination are tested by the powers of characters such as Thanos and Doctor Strange.  I could go on and on for hours about how much this movie does well, but instead I'm just gonna describe my theater experience. This was probably one of the worst audiences that I've ever watched a movie with yet. Whenever there was any kind of joke, the audience laughed so hard I couldn't hear the next lines. Well, I say \"any kind of joke\" but whenever there was a couple of lines that were genuinely clever and funny I was one of the only people who reacted. At one point Thor appeared onscreen (it was the bit when he ex machinas his way into Wakanda) and some guy stood up and started clapping and cheering \"WHOOO THOOOOOOOR\" and it was pretty annoying. Also there was a lot of other slightly less loud reactions to other events.  After the end-credits scene everyone left the theater pissed off. This movie does have multiple character deaths and legitimate consequences as opposed to most Marvel movies. Its kind of sad that negative audience reactions to things like that encourage studios to avoid risks in the future. Unlike other movies of this type, I had no clue what was going to happen because of where they took the story, and that's a good thing. I wish that less movies tried to go the route of the happy ending like this one.", "Ever since Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; they have been on a blockbuster roll, with their comic book movies. Their Cinematic Universe lead by producer, Kevin Feige has introduces countless amounts of superheroes and their stories to vary amounts of success. In return, every standalone & 'Avengers' assemble movie, the studio had made, has been built up to lead up to an all-encompassing climatic arch, in which big villain, Thanos (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) will one day, come to control the universe, through the use of six powerful infinity stones. Most of those films in their Phrase One & Two, kinda work, as they help push the apocalypse doom subplot, in a somewhat foreshadowing constant rate. However somewhere, in Marvel Studios Phrase 3 film campaign, that story thread began to lose some ground, as more popular & recent Marvel Comic story elements were put in the foreground like 'Civil War' & 'World War Hulk'. Because of that, it really felt, like Thanos threats of worlds domination storyline was not only coming at snail pace, but simply, delay, more and more, in order to milk more cash out of establish standalone films. Not only, was this decision, causing, doubt that this assemble movie would ever get release, but it was also, making people, wonder, if the film can be possible to be made. Finally, in 2017, we got our answer, as one of the biggest & the most ambitious film projects ever undertaken start to take shape with screenwriter, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors, Anthony & Joe Russo with their crew on hand, shooting back to back with a direct sequel. In 2018, on the ten year anniversary of the Studios first cinematic universe movie 2008's 'Iron Man', 'Avenger: Infinity War' was finally released to the public. Without spoiling the 19th overall film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, too much, it did live up to the hype as one of the best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet. It was somewhat accurate to the first half of the 'Infinity Gauntlet' comic book story, written by Jim Starlin, minus the absence of some key characters, like Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer and Mistress Death. Hopefully, they are in 2019 sequel. As for length. For 3 hour film, it was also surprisingly, well-paced. However, there were some really confusing exposition dump parts in the film that seem really odd. It seem like the movie cut a lot of sequences. One of them, involving the Nova Corp & the Power Stone, and the other, concerning the Soul Stone & Thanos's daughters. This also, includes the after credit ending, with the hints to Captain Marvel. Those parts really did seem like to come out of left field. Despite that, while, the movie does jump around, a lot; every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on many amazing heroic characters having to deal with such devastating stakes, in their own unique ways. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. It's also truly unique, in how well, the writers, fully introduced the villain with all the heroic characters, having to deal with him, one way or another. The screenwriters really did flesh out, Thanos from a cartoony over the top, out there simpleton baddie, into a believable down to earth, well verse, complex nemesis through his fatherhood subplot. Not only that, but Brolin's acting is so commanding, that he really seem like a serious threat with his voice. It was a huge improvement, since his last appearance. He's the best Marvel villain, yet. Even as a special effect character, Thanos kinda moves as if he's really there. The only scene, that kinda look fake with him, was, in the beginning, when he was choking out, a character. As for the good guys, the CGI suits on Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) & Spiderman (Tom Holland) could had look a little more realistic. It was given off, a 2011's 'Green Lantern' vibe. Other than that, all the action scenes with them, and the other CGI characters such as Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) were compelling enough to overlook the CGI spot fest. As for full make up performers like Dave Bautista (Drax), Karen Gillian (Nebula) and Zoe Saldana (Gamora). They did well in their scenes. As for Paul Bettany's acting was alright as Vision, but his makeup, was still a bit off. As for live action performers such as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) & Starlord (Chris Pratt) and others. Every performer in this movie did a great job in their action scene & their acting. Even, the Stan Lee & Peter Dinklage cameo was great. I have no complains about that. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of laugh out loud moments for a surprisingly dark film. As for the depressing bittersweet ending. I love it! While, a lot of diehard fans and young children might find, this climax to be upsetting. Just note, to take it, with a grain of salt. It's a comic book movie. There is always, going to be some kind of McGuffin or Ex Machina to bring them back. I just glad, Disney took the risk, rarely than play it safe. It was broad to subvert expectations. Overall: The movie was an exceptional achievement that somehow leaves you both fully satisfied and desperate for more. In the end, 'Avengers: Infinity War' ranks among the best adventures, we've seen yet from this stellar franchise. I can't wait for the next movie. I highly recommended seeing this.", "You can see the diference between a good movie witch is this one and a less good movie.You have everything in this movie.", "The movie is perfect so just go watch it. But there's a few things about the ending that give away the next film. I immediately thought, once he snapped his fingers, that of course along with half of the world, some avengers are eating dirt.   Once they started dying I actually gasped which was embarrassing but once Black Panther, Peter Quill, and Spiderman all died I thought oh well who cares cause obviously they are coming back; they wouldn't kill these new and important characters that easily. This is the only thing that ruined it for me because now the next film is so obvious.  The one thing Doctor Strange said to Tony about this being the only way, makes me think they have to die and Thanos has to win so that he can let his guard down in the next film and they can get the stones and revive everyone.  The one thing I'm confused about, isn't the Spiderman Homecoming set in 2020? He's not an avenger in 2020 and he's still as young in this one. They clearly messed that up. He also would go back on now having the Nano suit. It doesn't make sense. Homecoming completely contradicts the entire thing but I'm sure it was a mistake.  And they already confirmed Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and yeah you could assume it's a prequel and that's probably what they want you to think but come on, they're definitely brining them back. They killed off a ton of characters because they have too much and the next movie will be better with less powers and characters for however specific they choreograph the fight. Honestly if they had every single one together they would win so fast.  Plus if Captain Marvel is as strong as they're saying she is, they'll need less powers to give her a spotlight and really kick ass at the last second. Anyways, my bet for the next one, thanos will probably kill some avengers (for good). They will probably get the stone, resurrect whoever with probably some kind of consequence, destroy the stone, and when you think it's all happily ever after, someone will die, and they'll be screwed because the stone will already be destroyed. And if I'm correct, I better get a damn cookie.", "Don't have the words to describe how amazing this movie is. Great job marvel. It's just what I was waiting for for 10 years.", "Just amazing, brilliant story line and great intertwining of all characters", "SPOILER: Every comment I've read from a 1 Star to a 3 star have ALL stated they hate all Marvel movies. So let me just ask the obvious... why do you bother in the first place? Second, many of you have stated there's no plot. Have you not seen the 29 movies prior or is this your first marvel movie? I'm guessing this is your first. Lol \nThis movie was a treat. I honestly expected to be disappointed and boy was I wrong. I tried to critique it and judge it harshly and I can honestly say this film won my heart. It had that Bane from Batman feel and as much as I hate to admit it... I like when the bad guy accomplishes his mission once in a while. It's satisfying. Not because I'm pure evil or anything but because it goes away from tradition or the norm. It's bold, daring, and a fun ride. \nIf this is your first marvel movie or you think there's no plot do everyone a favor and don't comment.", "I'd say about 7/8ths of this movie is topnotch and worth watching. It misses the mark a little near the middle of the second half, but not catastrophically. Altogether it's a uniquely imaginative and ambitious ride. The action is pretty much non-stop and each actor's contribution takes the whole production a little bit higher. I would not have thought this kind of group effort possible, but it's almost as if everyone in the production felt the need to give it their all. Kudos to the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who have never tackled such a large project before. They definitely have the sensibilities and eye to make a movie rock. If I had to rank the performances, I'd have to say Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt were my personal favorites though I'd hate to do without any of the rest.", "It's different from any other Marvel movie. The villain actually wins! I think many people often wonder what would really happen if the bad guy won for once, and in this movie you get a glimpse of life after Thanos snapped his fingers and wiped half of humanity. You see everyone (in the movie and at the theater) shook to the ground by what happened. You actually see the heroes lose, and you see them hopeless; without knowing what to do next. Even freaking Nick Fury was vanished from existence.  I love how they left us waiting for something completely new. In the past, you looked forward to Marvel movies because they are awesome and very well done. But this time around you actually need to see the next one to see what the hell happens! Looking forward to the MCU future. If they did this bold movie, who know what's next.", "Leaves you speechless. I had to go see it a second time", "Simply the most captivating and mind boggling thing my eyes have ever witnessed!!", "My favourite MCU movies are The Winter Soldier, Ironman and even the first Avengers movie. I was hoping this one reaches or surpasses those, but I don't think this has. This is more like a bigger version of Ultron, much much bigger in scale. Might have enjoyed this much more as a teenager (I guess its mainly the teens who are the ones leaving 10/10 reviews), but now I need a superhero movie to deliver more than just the basic elements (great CGI, big scale, humour and good fight scenes - these things MCU usually gets right, and here they have outdone themselves yet again). For me Superhero movies (like epic fantasy movies) need to explain the power of each individual - specially the limitations of power, the character flaws, and consistent application of these rules. Those are the things that make it interesting. Limitless power is boring. Which is why I am not a big fan of Superman or Captain Marvel, but I like Spiderman, Ironman and even Batman. In the current MCU universe, the powers and specially the limitations of some characters are not well defined - like Dr Strange, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and Antman. Some of the things they can do almost makes them all-powerful and you wonder why don't they use those powers to get out of every situation.  This is where this movie lets us down - that consistency and power definition is lacking. Warning: Spoilers ahead Firstly, the good stuff:  1. Opening scene & Hulk: Loved the opening scene, and the fact that the hulk is beatable too. Even better was the psychological impact of this beating as Banner is not able to summon the Hulk at will. This adds so much depth to the character.  2. Darker tone: Set up so well in the opening scene, it is good to see MCU taking a bit darker tone - superhero's can also die. That makes this universe more unpredictable and so much more interesting. Also the layers in characters - they really developed Thanos character well in this movie - showing his emotional side helped.  3. Captain America: Never one of my favourite superheros, I like how his personality is changing and growing with every movie. The treatment of his gradual change is so consistent, you can see a \"perfect person\" is slowing changing into a more real person. Maybe they should have given him a bigger role, but perhaps that will happen in the next movie.  4. MCU set up: I guess this is the best part for all MCU fans, how all 18 previous movies have logically been leading up to the storyline of this one. The consistency and scale of this set up (while not perfect) is quite mind blowing - 18 standalone stories covering into one.  The Bad:  1. The time stone: I hate that stone. Any power which can go back in time to change history usually ruins the story for me because most writers don't know how to handle it. Its usually a cop out for bad writers to escape from writing a good story. Lets just kill everyone to shock the audience, then just rewind it to solve the problem. Terrible ending, this rewinding time bit was the worst part of the movie.  2. Supernova: Thor can survive a blast from a freaking supernova, really? That whole scene was so ridiculous, treating the audience like 5 year olds. Maybe if he had died there to create the weapon for someone else, that may have redeemed that scene a bit. 3. Thanos and the power of stones: The power of the stones and their limitations are not very well defined. We don't see Thanos growing in power with the addition of every stone, infact he looks stronger in the first scene with just one stone than in most of the movie with 2-3 stones. Rewinding time apart, now with 6 stones he can kill 50% of the universe with a click of his fingers, but cannot stop Thor from burying his axe into his chest? Doesn't make sense. Might have made a better movie if they had let Scarlet witch destroy 1 stone, so that no one is all powerful.  4. Consistency of powers: Vision and Scarlet Witch should not need help from the likes of Black Widow and Falcon, just like a tank does not need help from an ant. I guess this is a problem because the limitations of powers of Vision and Scarlet Witch haven't been defined properly before. Maybe if they had previously shown that Vision cannot function well when he is injured or that Scarlet Witch isn't every effective when she is emotional, that scene could have made sense.  Overall a good movie for watching once. But the time rewind thing is easily the main problem with this movie. With the post credit scene, I guess they have set it up very nicely for the Captain Marvel movie, which will lead nicely into the 2nd part of this movie - MCU does that so well. Buy I am not looking forward to see an all powerful Captain Marvel taking on an all powerful Thanos, rewinding time to bring back the superheros as per the writers whims and fancies. Yawn.", "Okay, i've seen it twice and the second time still blew me away. This movie had my heart racing, fists clenched and eyes watering at times (yes, it is emotional) but the timing, the action, and the story is done perfectly by the Russo's. This review contains spoilers so if you havn't seen it yet, don't read on. Lets start with the opening scene (one of my favourite scenes from the film) \nRight off the bat you're introduced to Thanos and the wreckage of the Asgardian ship with only Thor, Loki and Hamdal left alive. But its Loki who is fooling everyone in agreeing to give Thanos the tesseract and double crossing Thor. But the god of mischief quickly shocks all by saying \"we have a hulk\" and hulk emerges from nowhere and starts smashing down on Thanos. While your excitement is building in watching hulk do his thing, having the mad titan up against the wall, things quickly take a turn as thanos overpowers hulk and in two swift, but hard punches, dislocates both of hulks shoulders. For me, this set the tone of how brutal and strong Thanos is as he beats the hell out of hulk in a slick, boxing style! Ducking, weaving and delivering some devastating blows to hulk and eventually lifting him up over his head and smashing him into the ground. \nI knew then that Thanos was not gonna be like all other villains (forgettable) but a force to be reckoned with. With an actual personality, some dry humour, even emotion. He is one of the best characters the MCU have ever but on screen.  This scene set the tone for the movie. The Character shake up was refreshing also because it was good to see new characters interacting with old chatacters and the humour that went with it was great (Thor & Quill) lol. All in all, this movie is a masterpiece and has set the bar for future superhero movies. (DC don't have a leg to stand on right now) \nI will definitely watch it a third time!", "Overall Avengers: Infinity War is a descent 3 act film. First and foremost the opening scene is one of the best I've seen in any film in the MCU, it really establishes the power disparity between Thanos and our heroes. To start with some of the things I liked about the film I think most of the comedy beats hit well, the performances are there, exhilarating fight scenes and Thanos being the central character was a good move by the filmmakers. The issues I have with film are the under use of many characters and the somewhat prolonged length of the film and redundant elements of the story. Thor for instance isnt involved enough in the story he's shown to be extremely powerful but doesnt get to use that power til the end when it doesnt really matter any more. T'Challa and Winter Soldier basically had cameos and Captain America seemed unattached to the story with no clear purpose or character arc. Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange were pretty good. The Guardians of the Galaxy added comedic moments but asisde from Gamora they were less involved in the overall premise of the film. Vision and Scarlet are the only Characters to have clear motivation. In Essence, I felt the film was above average. I think the rave reviews are many people acting on impulse rather than letting the film marinate to form a truly honest opinion. Greatly filmed action scenes, good villain, just not strong execution.  7/10", "Absolutely incredible film, I was left shook when leaving the cinema. This is a must watch.", "This film is so funny and dark at the same time. I had an absolute blast.  These brothers directed winter soldier and civil war, so I knew the reviews would be believable.  At solid 10/10 film with everything you didn't expect and more.", "Haters will always hate, but I couldn't find anything worth moaning about in the 2 and a half hours i sat and watched this movie. Was pure enjoyment. A brilliant villain in thanos made the movie but thats not taking any credit away from the rest of the cast. Considering this film was jam packed full of stars, it did great to keep everyone onscreen and relivent in their own way. Great effects, real shocking moments and just an amazing fun packed entry into the franchise. Did not disappoint.", "Being a Marvel fan myself, i was expecting a kind of Avengers movie which would literally blow my mind ( After all the Hype & taking in account the previous MCU movies). As expected, Marvel delivered yet another masterpiece. This movie will surprise even those who are not new fans of Marvel. The plot is executed exceptionally well. The costumes, certain dialogues & some occasional humour ( Yes, you read it right. Surprised, aren't you? ) they are all just FANTASTIC. Each and every character has its own role to play ( Except Peter Quill AKA Star Lord . Just Kidding) be it small or large. So many characters, still you never seem to forget any of those as they are all AWESOME in their own way (of course not as cool as Iron Man or Doctor Strange or Thor). A big thanks to the directors (The Russo Brothers), who did their absolute best in satisfying their fans (& not giving even a slightest of hint about anything in the movie during all the promotions). Guys, do watch it even if you are not a Marvel fan. The movie will not cease to surprise you time and again.", "Ever since it was revealed that the 3rd installment of the Avengers saga would feature (almost) all superheroes from previous Marvel films, the stake was immediately put high. Even though my expectations were not considerably high, having Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther still fresh in my memory I was certain that this movie would not dissapoint. I was wrong. First of all, don't let the title mislead you; one would think that Infinity War would treat the original Avengers (Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk and Hawkeye) similarly to the first and second films. In reality this is a story about the playful (and pop-culture reference packed) rivalry between Peter Quill/Starlord, Tony Stark/Iron Man, Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange and, at times, Peter Parker/Spiderman. I admit I laughed at quite a few of their jokes, but after a certain point it seemed that this was it; that was essentially the film. With Starlord and Spiderman almost useless in battle scenes, I expected more of Doctor Strange and his so called mastery of the dark arts, while I found Iron Man pretty much the same.  The scenes featuring the above mentioned were (at least seemed to be) more in number or length than those with the other characters. Captain America and Black Widow were pretty much ignored or poorly developed in character, and as for Bruce Banner it was a great opportunity to show his internal conflict with Hulk, but instead you got more comedy, less Dr Banner scinetific brilliance and almost zero Hulk action. Thor was more authentic considering that the film takes over Ragnarok's last scene; his ship destroyed, his people exterminated, and his brother subsequently killed in front of his eyes, all by the hand of Thanos, makes him vulnerable and more human. His later quest to find a weapon mighty enough to take on the villain finds him teamed up with Rocket Raccoon and Groot, which was...ok; his is maybe the best representation of the initial five (Hawkeye does not appear in this film). As for the other characters, they're mostly decorative and mistreated in terms of development or even screen-time such as Falcon, Winter Soldier/White Wolf (yes, Bucky has a new name), Mantis, Nebula and War Machine. Black Panther behaved as expected of the king of the country where the most important battle is held, with Shuri and Okoye less fierce but still efficient. The romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch was mediocre at best and some long-expected reunions (Steve Rogers-Bucky Barnes, Bruce Banner-Natasha Romanoff) totally understated. Loki was wonderful as always and his demise, although untimely, did him justice (he is my favourite character, well, was). The pleasant surprise was Gamora and her back story, which connected her to Thanos. But the greatest of them all in the story is the villain. Thanos was very good, maybe unexpectedly good, with a little bit of a human side to his person. His desire to destroy is explained, his power matches his reputation, his dialogue is the most interesting...overall he's what makes up the good part of the film. Josh Brolin's performance is laudible! In conclusion, an expensive production and an enormous box-office do not guarantee quality. This film was centered around a specific number of less attractive or even likable characters (Starlord, Doctor Strange) and the inequality between action and plot scenes, each starring 10 characters, is tiresome and boring. I assume that the next one will introduce Captain Marvel and bring Hawkeye, Ant-Man and the Wasp. Not sure I'll watch.  P.S Dear Marvel, you could do so much better...", "This movie exceeded all my expectations. It was hilarious, action packed, emotional, devastating, everything a movie should be. After the movie ended, everyone in the cinema literally sat there for 10 minutes thinking what just happened. Rarely does a movie have such impact on the audiences. I am looking forward to the next one even more now.", "What else can you say? \n The plot is all right. \n Behind the plot, Infinity War contains something more than that. Those individuals hero films make Infinity War even better. They have the connection between it (since the first avengers movie you can tell). \n During 2.5hrs, we are watching something predictable things, but do not forget this is a marvel hero movie, those marvel individual movie themes gives you some special juice.\n Marvel has ambition and Stand Lee as well.", "This movie still has me in awe of its greatness. I absolutely loved this film and so happy to be on this thrill ride. Avengers Infinity War doesn't disappoint in fact it by far exceeded expectations. Thank you to the cast and crew for this amazing epic movie.", "Hands down the best Marvel movie Yet. So much to see and take in. Stories woven together in fine style. Visually a delight to watch.", "Seeing Infinity War was one of the most interesting and most enjoyable experiences a person can have true they probably might have pulled a RWBY(a Rooster Teeth show which I do recommend) after ten years of marvel movies this pulls all increases into a big bowl of fun .after seeing this movie there were kids and probably adults crying a little bit.but I know that this is a part 1 of 2 so I felt hope that all heroes will come back in the sequel. And no I'm just a comic book reader/video gamer who likes action and for those people, who Don't get the story see all the Marvel movies to understand the plot.", "Absolutely amazing. From start to finish action packed, never a dull moment, truly amazing achievement from everyone who worked on this.", "Absolutely my favorite marvel movie. Wonderful acting, action , comedy & drama all mixed together like never before. Highly recommend to watch in IMAX!!!", "Amazing film that was worth the hype and expectations that people put on it. From the second the movie starts until after the post credits scene, this has you on the edge of your seat! AWESOME MOVIE!!", "The Russo brothers did it again! I was blown away by this movie. Every character had their screen time and interactions between them were very good. As a huge fan of Spider-Man I can say that the Iron-Spider suit in the movie looked awesome. Thanos is probably the best marvel villain and the CGI looked on point. Overall this might be the best MCU film up to date!", "I was sure with having so many characters, stories would be lost. I was way wrong. This movie kept you wanting more from the start. Can't wait for the next one!!", "We have been waiting for a long time for this and obviously worth it.", "The greatest villain of all...Thanos!!! Your favorite super heroes faces their greatest foe! The journey of Thanos collecting the infinity stones. Prepares them for an epic battle. Wow is a word to describe the movie! This is a definitely a must see! Josh Brolin does an excellent job as Thanos.", "This is quite simply phonomenal, unique and stands out to all other marvel movies. I would recommend this to almost anyone.", "There is a dilemma of not being able to say much after you watch this movie when you follow the directors' request of keeping the hype free of spoilers. Also, I would hate to spoil it for fans as much as I might have killed who do it to me. It also happens that I cannot contain my reaction so here what you should know. So this is a review about nothing.\nFirst, let me tell you the other possible tag lines that describe this movie the best:\n1. The Greatest Superheroes' movie of All time.\n2. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU THINK YOU'RE PREPARED, WELL, YOU ARE NOT AND YOU CAN NEVER BE.\nSecond, let's talk about the movie itself. Avengers might be in the title but you will certainly feel it's like the ones before. It is like four whole movies merged into a big one. First you will visit the worlds you know, and then those worlds will come together and get divided into whole new worlds, which will again get together in the most unexpected way. You will find yourself switch from one world to another the way you switch channels, feeling confused before you remember this is infinity War and that it's supposed to happen. It's not the way this movie summed up a whole universe of 18 movies before it that it's considered genius, it's how you find yourself get transitioned from one world to another, how to get from one point to a very far way one so simply and naturally only to leave you not feeling anything but stunned. \nThird, what to expect?\nWell, there is actually no point cause no matter how you watched and rewatched every single work marvel had produced, you will still be left thunderstruck. You will laugh, cry, sometimes both at the same time. You will be hit by surprise that you find nothing to do except to stare at the screen with wide eyes and a jaw dropped to the floor. You will be scared, shocked and lot of the times will catch yourself sitting on the edge of your seat, literally, raising your hand to your mouth in the most unexpected moments. The most important thing though that all of this will be in a good way. \nRequest: Please go watch it. Whether you are a Marvel fan or not , whether you are a superheroes' movies fan or not. You might regret that you didn't experience it in the time when it's still fresh and no one had spoiled it for you, but what's even more important, is that you will find whatever you wish for in it. If not, watch it to witness an example of how passion and dedication take works of art to excellence.", "Wait a second people. I see bad reviews. Predictable? Dude it's a comic based piece. What are we expecting, Batman? Without any spoilers I think we can tell that the only one actor in the leading role was Josh Brolin as the main character Thanos. Perfectly built plot around Thanos. The ones who found holes (holes, really?) will never understand how this masterpiece was perfectly balanced and also placed Thanos short but emotional trip in the MCU. I guess the only marvel movie fans will like this movie. But for comic fans like me, who know all the characters for a long time... wow this is an additional treat to the universe that the comics gave us since we are child. Long years behind us lads! It was worth the wait! ( :", "Awesome! The way they developed the story, the way heroes worked together, the comedy component, and the unpredicted end... for me is a 10", "What can i say about infinity wars that hasn't been said before. It's the first part of the epic conclusion to the previous 10 years of story telling. It features attention to detail like no other film, with plot points that have been worked on over the course of those 10 years. The only thing i can say honestly is that it completely changes the face of superhero films, it draws you in, leaves you saddened, excited, scared and on the verge of tears, but yet we still want more, it leaves you hanging on the edge throughout the film, until the stunning and heart wrenching conclusion leaves you hungry for more. bravo Russo brothers, you've created a masterpiece.", "This is the best Marvel movie without a doubt if not one of the greatest movie of all time IMO. As a big fan of Marvel, I had very high expectations & I was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype but this movie exceeded it.  The characters and the casting were great as always. The story was just on point and it is very much a Thanos' story and a movie as the directors said. The pacing is just right so it keeps you on the edge and flows together. I was worried about all the CGI especially for Thanos but man the visuals effects are amazing. He looks so real! Thanos was phenomenal. He was an absolutely badass yet at times a sympathetic villain. You understood him. They really nailed the character. I liked that he actually had a decent motivation. The score fits right in with the scene and really gives you the chills.What can I even say about action.... it is just perfect.  Mostly everyone has a moment to shine in the film. The Russo brothers really managed the screen times of characters pretty well. Everyone has done their part really well & I'm in so much joy. Do yourself a favour & go watch it in the cinemas. It is brilliant.", "Just left try midnight showing a few hours ago and had time to sit back and process. I can't believe even after all the hype this movie had i still came out as amazed as I did. This is special. I can't wait to tell my kids I saw it in cinemas. You don't want to miss this", "There is nothing about this film for anyone above the age of 12.", "Crappy ending and a crappy story line...\nCrappy ending and a crappy story line...\nCrappy ending and a crappy story line...\nCrappy ending and a crappy story line...\nCrappy ending and a crappy story line...", "Avengers: Infinity War might just be the most insane movie I've ever seen. I'm literally left speechless coming out of this movie. The Russo Brothers have once again made a great Marvel film, this time on the biggest scale in MCU history. Basically every Avenger you've seen on screen is in this movie and it's pretty awesome. There's a lot to love here. First, it was such a joy to see all the Avengers on screen together again. The comradery between all of them is great and the interaction between characters who meet for the first time is both hilarious and powerful. Second, Thanos is officially the best villain in the MCU. Killmonger was great but Thanos takes it to a while another level. This is by far the darkest Marvel movie and Thanos is the driving force behind it. Josh Brolin gives an amazing performance as Thanos, who is much more layered than I thought. Thanos made the stakes feel real, which is often a knock on the MCU, and he made the heroes feel a sense of real desperation that honestly seemed to lack in the other Avengers movies. The movie took great risks story-wise that will leave everyone thinking hard for a long, long time. What makes Infinity War stand out is the bold new directions it goes in, and it completely pays off. The way the movie wraps up will undoubtedly cause so much craze. I'm still flustered by what I saw. Even though the movie is so dark, the humor is great (again). As always, the action scenes and music are amazing.  However, no movie is perfect. There are so many characters in Infinity War and it easily succumbs to this throughout. The Russo's handled it as well as they could have I think, but the pacing and tone are really uneven at times, especially in the first hour. The movie jumps to so many different places and tones, and it felt way too fast. Also, some of the character decisions did not make sense and left me confused.  Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The villain Thanos is the best and his impact on the heroes is ridiculously amazing. I really have no idea where Marvel goes from here going forward in all honesty, and that's a testament to how bold this movie is in its endeavors. Avengers: Infinity War gets an A.", "The Russos have in one foul swoop forgotten what a comic book movie is meant to be about. Instead they've attempted to make a dramatic oscar winner but in essence screwed up 10 years hard work by hundreds of actors and filmmakers. The first movie the the entire MCU that i want a refund for seeing at the theater and will never watch again.", "I've enjoyed some of the Marvel oeuvre.. but honestly.. this is not up to the mark, nowhere bloody near, not at all. Let's be honest; It's a turkey.  Very poor directing, Russo bros.. whoever they are.. it's like.. are they in the right job or did someone mistake the set janitors and kept them on to lower costs? Shoddy in fact; - they'd have been far better off using whoever directed Thor 3, Dark World or Avengers Age of Ultron, or Ironman III, Or even Thor Ragnarok, - all better directed and more watchable movies. The cinematography of the 'live' footage was generally awful. I mean, shocking. Amateur. It made me wonder if they'd used the wrong lenses or cameras or something.  As for performances.. 'Acting', as it used to be called.. where to start.. I'll keep it simple: Most of the 'stars' including RDJ are taking the piss.. it's not as if they had a great deal to do anyway, but.. they must be laughing all the way to the bank.. call this a day job? They're getting money for old rope.  The screenplay, the plot - is practically non-existent, and what there is is balderdash, tripe, codswallop and piffle. Half a crap story painfully overstretched into well over two hours.. the ending is a complete cop-out / a cobbled together mess.. they must've been stoned and thought it was clever.. it wasn't, it isn't.  I was actually looking forward to seeing this.. but having already seen Ready Player One a few weeks back - absolutely no contest - Ready Player one is a truly great movie, by a great director, great cinematography, screenplay, story, plot, music, soundtrack, FX, ideas, the whole kaboodle.  Comparing Avengers Infinity war to ready Player One is like putting a used Edsel next to a brand new Aston Martin.  This is a big big budget movie that (apart from some quality CGI) looks like it was made on a shoestring in a back-alley. Shame on the Russos.. and whoever else was responsible for this forgettable pile of doo-doo.  Oh, the (almost entirely scored) soundtrack wasn't bad.. but way too glorious for the poor character playing, performances, script and screenplay.  Watch it when your friends buy the dvd or something.. save your money for DeadPool II or buy the DVD of Ready Player One!", "Did the writers have no self respect? Just looking for a paycheck I guess. This movie is what happens when you listen to producers' notes. I'm surprised the actors signed on for this. Embarrassed for them. They look bad for being in this. A COWARDLY hulk?! Really?!", "I think Marvel should have made a solo Thanos movie before infinity war. They could easily started this movie with Thanos having 2 or 3 Infinity Stones already.  But overall it is a great Movie and don't deserve the low ratings many people are giving!!", "Film is amazing best one they have made yet so looking forward to part 2 this film definitely a 10/10 rating!", "You want action? This here's the MCU's version of an All Star event. With the dunking contest, the home-run derby, and the main event. It's half time and the team has seriously taken a beating. Let's recap. The other team looked downright invincible at first. But our team got in their licks. Several players on the opposing team were taken out too. This is a war anyways, it's like everybody forgets that. It has drama! It has a villain that actually thinks he's in the right. He's not just doing this because he likes being a villain. His followers actually believe in his cause, aren't just there as mercenaries. There are people on our planet who feel the same way Thanos does! That overpopulation is killing our planet. Thanos actually cries real tears. This is the closest thing to an actual comic book adaption that has ever been filmed. It follows the storyline.It wasn't messed with for Hollywood audiences. A lot of the critics just don't seem to get that. I would not recommend taking pre-teens to see this without a conversation first about how this is a comic book adaption. These characters aren't real and neither are..their deaths.You've already seen many, many Marvel characters die on screen in other movies. Why this is effecting people so much is ridiculous. Of course most of them will return...hello..they have movies scheduled for several of them.  I for one am joyful because I've been reading the Thanos saga since the old Captain Marvel comics(Mar-vell) and can even see elements of those storylines in here, and can pretty much follow what's going to happen and it's awesome! The movie is everything you want without going overboard. It's laugh out loud funny at times, it connects all the character seamlessly. Most of the second tier characters will have big roles in the following movie. That's a great thing. Remember \"So you're saying theres a chance\"", "Yes. It's a fun movie to watch. Yes, it definitely has its moments. I know there are far superior reviews preceding mine, ones where the reviewers break it all down and get all \"science-y\" and some even discuss the characters and plot. All I wanna do here in my review is have my say about what I saw (and heard), and a handful of thoughts I had during the movie. First of all: when did The Avengers, whom I like to think of as The Get-Eveners, as they are indubitably out there to even the score with the baddies and wreak vengeance aplenty-------when did The Get-Eveners morph into Guardians of the Galaxy comedians? Sure, the Guardians cast is there, so you'd expect those silly jokes, bad puns, and, of course, The Get-Eveners have always had their own style of quipping , albeit a bit more sophisticated. . .But . . .when did *every other line* become a quip? Gad, that was a bit much. Quip . . . action . . . quip . . .action. I have coined a new term for this and I dub The Avengers: Infinity War a \"quipaction\" flick. Honestly, does there have to be some inane, barely \"cute\" quip every other sentence? If so, let's get some better jokes at least. Other things stood out for me and, don't worry, I enjoyed the movie, but just had to put a few more \"insights\" out there for you readers (both of you.): Robert Downey, Jr. is FINALLY looking old. Gorgeous Iron Man, where oh where did you misplace that Fountain of Youth? Still a looker, but I hate it when actors suddenly age. It makes me feel . . . old. Love the voice, Downey; love you. Josh Brolin is awesome in his role. \"Thanos,\" as I am sure the die-hard fans amongst you know means \"immortal\" in Greek. Thanos was terrifically acted. I thought the CGI was kind of bizarre and plenty distracting a lot of the time, but I love how Brolin's mannerisms and facial expressions came through on the big screen. Brolin makes a formidable baddie. I'm tired of writing now, so I will only mention two other things that I REALLY liked about the film. I LOVED IT when Scarlet Johansson says, in her initimably super sultry and SEXY voice, \"She's not alone.\" I wish I could have played that back, right there in the theatre, over and over again. (I will do it now, online.) For me, those three little words made up one of THE best moments in the entire movie. Black Widow had so little time onscreen. Hearing her speak that one line was worth the price of admission. Scarlet's voice and the Wakandas chanting. Yep. A solid 9 for this flick.", "Im generally a fan of superhero movies... the well written ones. But i didnt think they could pull this movie off. Too many superheros. Trying to toss in everyone you can to expand the $$$ base. They were becoming formulaic (insert next villain here. superhero gets cocky... is taken down..gets humble.. defeats generic supervillain x). But this movie was wow. It tosses all those conventions out the window. It's funny but it doesnt toss easy predictable snark at you. EVERY hero in this movie needs to be there. And all the best things about them are there. In the case of Cap.. well he just seems to get more awesome while maintaining his true superpower - always doing the right thing.. regardless. And Stark is more human than ever.. i was concerned they were making him a caricature. These are people who are used to being superior to every human.. facing a literal god. Whos minions are near gods themselves. Imagine the avengers facing 2 of Thanos minions.. and you sitting there pretty sure they cant defeat them. Or even one. And the very best.. and most horrific part i cant tell you. This movie is brilliant.. and the next one will break every box office record recorded.. regardless of whether it is good or not. Go watch it. You will love it. Note: a few critics trying to be hipstercool are trashing this movie. If they are.. you know who not to read anymore. Theyre literally , conciously trying to be too cool for school by not liking an absolutely brilliant movie", "I saw Avengers Infinity War at the cinema and thought it was a brilliant film and a really good addition to the MCU collection. I have been a fan of the MCU since it began with Iron Man in 2008, and after 19 films the only one I have disliked is Dr Strange.\nI liked the character of Dr Strange but the film itself just got weird with the buildings turing on thier head and everything spiralling around them. Dr Stange is himself a good addition to the MCU, and putting him with the rest of the Avengers kept him more 'grounded' (for lack of a better word) than if he were alone or with other magical beings.\nOne thing that I thought was strange is that he had an infinity stone yet never used it? During that fight with him, Iron Man, Spider-Man and the Guardians Vs Thanos, how much easier would it have been if he had simply frozen time?\nOk he used it once to see all the possible futures, and claims there was only one in which they win. But he clearly saw something else that he kept to himself because he was quick to surrender the stone to save Stark. I was dissapointed that one of my favourite originals - Hawkeye - was missing (and why hasn't he had his own film yet? He more than deserves it) there is a reason I'm sure but it's still dissapointing.\nAnd as a relative new-comer I had expected to see Ant-Man in the mix.\nAnd on this note what happened to Korg, Meek and Valkryie? They were on the Asguardian refugee ship with Thor, Loki, Hulk and Heimdall at the end of Thor Ragnarok so where did they go? I thought how Iron Mans suit had evolved with Wakandan nano technology was a good touch as it showed how Wakanda was intergrading itself into the world, but I thought they went a little over the top with it: turning his arms into swords and hammers etc almost instantly seemed a bit too much (it was almost like watching the fight scene between Peter Quill and a Ego in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 when a giant rock Ego attacks a rock Pac Man) and the extra weapons that sprout from his back to hover at his sides just seems implausible.\nBoth Black Panther and Spider-Man's suit were also using the same nano technology but couldn't do that, so why do it to Iron Man? I liked Spider-Mans new suit, it looked really cool; they had hinted at this suit at the end of Spider-Man Homecoming and it was great to see it in action. I liked the spiders legs that sprout from his back, reminiscent of the spider suit Peter Parker has in some Spider-Man games I've played, but where was the A.I. KAREN of his previous suit? I hope this new suit doesn't mean she's gone (hopefully it's like JARVIS and FRIDAY, whereby she continues in whatever suit he wears) I thought they went wrong with Thor.\nIn Thor Ragnarok they let him explore his true powers after Mjolnir was destroyed by Hela, but suddenly they have back-peddled and gave him a new hammer/axe - Stormbreaker.\nI see why they wanted Thor to go to Nidavellir, to show that the same dwarfs that created Mjolnir also made Thanos' gauntlet, and therefore hint at its power, but I thought how they tied Thor down to another hammer/axe stifled him.\nI didn't really get how a small hammer/axe has the same power as the bifrost, where does it draw its power for a start? All that aside it was good to see him using Stormbreaker it the big fight on Earth, and he did use his new-found powers to a degree, but I would have liked to see him build on the power he had unlocked at the end of Thor Ragnarok more, and they were quick to ditch the eyepatch. Why was Black Widow suddenly blonde, what is the point of that? I did like the fight scenes with her and the Wakandan Captain Vs Thano's followers. I thought having Paul Bettany looking like himself over Vision was a good touch, it had been shown in Captain America Civil War that he was starting to evolve and develop human traits, so showing him with a proper human form seemed right, but he was only like that for a short time, then for the rest of the film he remained in the robot form he'd always been which was a shame. I thought how they retained the personality of the Hulk (which they established in Thor Ragnarok) was good, giving him the ability to control himself in not allowing Bruce Banner to bring him out, then allowing him to communicate with Bruce.\nBy not having the Hulk and giving Bruce Banner the 'Hulk Buster MKII' suit was an excellent idea, it gave the team the power and strength of Hulk, a nod to Iron Man (who was absent from the fight as he was on Thanos' planet) and we got to see more of Bruce than in previous films where usually the Hulk would take over. Sticking loosely to the Hulk, it was weird how suddenly Heimdall is able to summon the power of the bifrost to sent Hulk to Earth (but then how else would he have got back) but if he could do that why not also save Thor, Loki and himself at the same time? And how are we only seeing this in him now after 3 Thor films?\nI will say I was sad to see Heimdall executed. I thought it was sad when Loki was killed by Thanos, but it did inspire Thor to fight back - and honestly we've seen Loki 'die' in nearly every film he's been in, so I wouldn't be surprised to find him alive somewhere down the line.\nThanos did make a mocking comment about 'no more ressure ting' but I don't believe that. It was good to finally see the Guardians of the Galaxy properly intergraded with the Avengers, although I was very sad to see Gamora 'die'.\nSpider-Mans references to films continued in this film, and how he and Peter Quill talked about movies I thought helped to cement the Gaurdians with the Avengers. I liked the cameo by Red Skull, I didn't think he had just died at the end of Captain America The First Avenger, so it is good that we got closure by seeing his fate. Nick Fury's scene at the end was really only there to give a link to the MCU's next big character - Captain Marvel.\nHaving not read the comic-books I'm not fully familiar with all the characters, but from what I've read online Captain Marvel has superhuman strength, durability and speed, she can fly and is able to project and absorb energy.\nNot that I'm against Captain Marvel, but she is basically there to fulfil the roles of a creature that won't show his green face anyway (Hulk), two dead men (Quicksilver and Vision) and someone who has been 'destroyed' by the soul stone (Scarlett Witch) it seems she is only there to ensure a victory for the Avengers. I say 'destroyed' with quotation marks against Scarlett Witch because, also from reading online, people 'destroyed' by the soul stone are presumably retained inside the stone, and can be resurrected from it should the bearer choose.\nSo it's possible that everyone 'destroyed' by Thanos with the stone could be resurrected later; as too with Gamora who was sacrificed by Thanos in order to claim the soul stone - and her survival was hinted at further by her child self appearing to Thanos (presumably she appeared as her child self because that is how Thanos always remembered her) And we all know that eventually that HAS to happen; they already announced that there will be another Spider-Man film, so he must return.\nThere is likely to be another Guardians film so that's Peter Quill, Gamora, Mantis, Groot and Drax to come back (otherwise who's left? Rocket and Nebula) this would also apply to Black Panther and Dr Strange.\nAssuming the absent Hawkeye survived Thanos' universal mass-exodus, none of the original Avengers were destroyed. Very curious, I don't see yet how Iron Man can get back from Thanos' world as he was left there alone, but are we going to see an original team reunion? This was a very good film, but the mass-exodus the end (that we already know wouldn't last) did lose the film a star in my opinion.", "Ten years ago, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was birthed with Iron Man, a supremely confident film which resurrected a career and started a shared universe of unprecedented proportions. Eighteen films later and an impressive number of superheroes introduced on the roster so far, we arrive at Avengers: Infinity War, a film so hugely anticipated that even hiding under a rock wouldn't let you escape it.  With relationships shattered after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers must team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put a stop to Thanos (Josh Brolin), a mad titan hell bent on collecting all the Infinity Stones and bringing balance to the universe. The Russo brothers were the ones handed the unenviable task of bringing together pretty much every single superhero introduced so far in the MCU and having them share the screen without the film becoming a complete mess. Having achieved such great things with Captain America: Civil War, there was nobody I'd rather have take on the challenge. Now with Avengers: Infinity War, they've managed to deliver a non-stop thrill ride that is well and truly worth the ten years of character and story building it took to get to this point. Due to the balancing act of reintroducing characters and the film's narrative, things do take a little amount of time to really get going however, it's very much a necessity and it makes for such a worthwhile second act as our heroes team up to take on Thanos. Thor coming across the Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange trying to tame Tony Stark's ego, both sets meeting for the first time, makes for an entertaining adventure and once again proves that these MCU films are at their best when these characters interactions are played out so well.  When it comes to the action side of things, driven by superior visual effects and such ferocious scale, Infinity War is one of the craziest films I've ever laid my eyes upon. The team-ups that play out in this film are exciting enough but then the moments that the Russo brothers deliver with them take them to the next level. It's really expected in today's cinema to see such grand visual effects, particularly in action sequences, but what really stunned me was how incredible Thanos looked, the detail in his features making him so much more of an intimidating figure. More on that guy later.  Infinity War features probably the most A-list cast of all time so you'd expect them all to get a major amount of screen time for this film to run smoothly. It's shared as equally as possible, some getting a bit more to do than others, and it's a tactic that pays off, both in terms of narrative and spectacle. Robert Downey Jr. has been synonymous with the role of Iron Man for the past ten years but it doesn't stop him from giving it his all here, the combination of his assurance and naivety as Iron Man making for a dangerous cog in the Avengers wheel as they suit up to take on Thanos. I could go through all the performances but Downey Jr.'s is the one out of the heroes that stood out for me. I mentioned how Thanos is brought to life through amazing visual effects earlier but none of it would be possible without Josh Brolin's motion-capture performance in the role. Thanos takes no time in showing just how much trouble the Avengers are in, his physical presence obviously giving him a bit of an advantage however, Brolin's voice work and facial expressions bring a whole new dimension to the character. Furthermore, Thanos is given plenty of screen time to delve into a bit of his backstory, adding an emotional weight and gravitas which in turn leads to him becoming one helluva villain, the best in the MCU by a mile. Avengers: Infinity War is event cinema at its finest, the balance of comedy and drama works wonders, as do these characters forced together to fight the true evil threatening the universe. There's plenty of crowd-pleasing moments as well as a fair share of crowd-shocking moments, the Russo brothers closing the film out rather brilliantly. Don't forget though, there's more to come when the Avengers return next year so, for now, it's time to take a deep breath and think about what you've just witnessed.", "No spoilers here - jut my reasons I enjoyed the film. Story = 10\nActing = 10\nCGI = 10\nPlot = 10\nExecution = 10 This was the best super hero movie to date. All of the individual story line movies deal with issues on a small scale. Avengers 1 was the first time we saw that scale stepped up a notch which is why is worked so well. Subsequently, that is where the issues lied in Avengers 2 (although it was still a \"good\" movie.) The scale of this movie both excited and scared me. I felt nervous coming into this movie because I knew how hard this movie was going to be to pull off. The movie executed on all those metrics I listed above, but it was also funny and heartfelt without being cheesy. I have always felt that is the biggest challenge not only in superhero movies, but in all movies.", "(No Spoiler Review)\nOkay, I don't know where to start ... For those who haven't watched yet, book your tickets right now and those who have already watched will know what i am talking about. The hype was more than Ever. The Excitement was more than ever.\nInfinity war was filled with Emotions, Comedy, drama and Action. I don't think there was any scene where i wasn't excited or drawn into. Goosebumps never left my body until the movie was Over. The fight Scenes were just Amazing to watch. We got a Villain, who held his own in front of our Heros.\nThe level of Acting was just out of the world. The Comic timing got Everyone in the theater laughing out of their seats, the intense drama got everyone Emotional.\nIt would be hard to wait for the next part but i guess it's worth it.\nAvengers - Infinity war was not an Experience, It was a Life Event.", "I have never wrote a review on a movie but this was just absolutely spectacular! Best movie I have seen in a long long time! Definitely a must see!!", "Epic..........\nwhy....?\nbecause it is ten years of preparing to this WOW moment \nevery thing was just perfect we laught we cry we enjoy .....", "This film tells the story of the ensemble of Marcel superheroes uniting to fight against an evil man called Thanos. It is a joy just to watch the numerous famous faces in the film! The story is good, visuals are fantastic, and there are loads of fighting. It has all the elements of a blockbuster. However, the plot doesn't drive itself, and is not overly engaging because of the vast number of characters in different locations and subplots. It feels a bit fragmented to be. Still, I enjoyed the film a lot. By the way, the ending surprised me a little, and I guess we have to wait for the resolution of the story in the next Avengers gymf.", "EDIT after second viewing today. I liked it a lot more today, mainly because I saw the movie for what it is, and not for what I intended it to be.\nI could easily change my score to a 9/10, but it probably would not be fair.\nUndoubtly stands the test of multiple viewings, very good movie overall. The board was set, the pieces were ready, but an unfortunate lack of ambition and commitment prevented this movie from living up to the marketed premise, thus failing to deliver the much needed and desired ten year emotional punch. It's still a very good movie, in its own merits.\nThe very best action scnenes, the jaw dropping cinematography (Imax 3d showcase!), a beautiful and emotionally soundtrack. The movie tries its best to handle the various groups of characters, but clocking at 150 minutes, there is only so much one can fit in.\nPrecious minutes are sometimes wasted in rather poor and awkward atempts of comic relief that overstay their presence.\nSome characters do not get enough screen time, it was never going to be easy to fit everyone in, but there were clearly questionable decisions, pacing problems and unwanted discrepancy. Thanos character is one of the highlights, and is handled quite nicely, although his origin has been cut from the movie,\nEven so, we can clearly understand what and why he wants to do.\nOne of the very best Marvel villains.\nAs it also happens in the comics, Thanos shows a lack of competence in handling his growing powers, being seemingly allmighty in one scene, and a juvenile brawler in the next.\n \nThis movie did not fulfill my - high! - expectations, and it's sad to know it failed to do so due to a \"creative\" vision that fell short of the ultimate ambition the movie required.\nAnyway, still a pretty good superhero blockbuster, one of the better Marvel films (not on the very top tier, though) and highly recommended to not only comic book nerds as myself, but also to the general fantasy/action/sci-fi movie audience. 8/10 \n(as a long time Marvel fan, I truly wish I could rate this movie higher, but honestly and sadly.... can't.)", "This was an ambitious film. Capping off 10 years of Marvel superhero films. In a nutshell, it confirmed my impression that Marvel are at their best when they focus a film on an individual hero or group of heroes (such as Black Panther or Guardians of the Galaxy). The crossover films tend to suffer from the story being spread too thinly over several story arcs and this film was yet another example of that. The good. Visual effects were the usual high standard we expect from these films. It's an amazing spectacle. The action sequences were also superb as we've come to expect. What Marvel have always done well, they continued to do well here. Cheeky humour was used in good doses, mostly at appropriate moments (as opposed to the grossly overused and often inappropriately timed humour in Thor Ragnarok). The bad. There were many corny, predictable moments in this film. For the most part, Marvel were playing it pretty safe. Early in the movie there were a couple of moments where a character appeared without clearly showing who it was, leaving the audience guessing for a few seconds. Would it be Iron man? Captain Americal etc. A little tease before the full reveal. That was cool the first few times. It got old pretty quick, however, by the time they'd used that trick 7 or 8 different times. My overall impression of the first half of the movie was plenty of action. But too much happening with too many characters in too many places. The rapid switching from one location / group of characters to another was often jarring and made it difficult to really care about some of the character arcs and sub plots that were clearly meant to be pretty important. It seemed to lack continuity, flow, whatever you would call it. The last half of the movie was where Marvel became less predictable and defied expectations. Normally I'd say that's a good thing. Honestly though, I hated the ending. Without spoiling anything, I'd say it left me feeling highly unsatisfied after what was generally a very enjoyable film. Usually I stick around for the post credits scene to enjoy the nice little extra they throw in. This time I stuck around hoping it would improve the ending. It didn't. It seemed a lot of build up to... nothing? I'm sure it was meant to be a bit of a cliff hanger to get us excited for the next Marvel film and I'm sure it's an ending that would appeal to hardcore comic fans. As a casual marvel movie fan though, it left me feeling very flat and overall disappointed with which was otherwise a pretty solid film", "It was an okay movie. Nothing too good, nothing too bad.", "Greetings again from the darkness. We are at the 10 year mark of the new Marvel cinematic universe that began with the revolutionary IRON MAN (2008). This 19th movie in the franchise is actually Part 1 of 2 films that will (supposedly) be the lasting legacy of The Avengers. The second \"half\", much of which was filmed simultaneously with this one, is set for 2019. Co-directing brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were responsible for the two most recent Captain America movies (and also one of my all-time least favorites: YOU, ME AND DUPREE), and have now taken on the biggest budget, biggest cast, and longest run time yet of any Marvel movie. In fact, it's so big, it could only be named 'Infinity'.  Being that the fan base for this movie is highly sensitive to anything resembling a hint, much less a spoiler, this review will tread very lightly, and instead function as an overview with very general observations. There are a few key points, most of which are quite obvious from either the trailers or the previous movies in the series. First thing to realize is that this is a Thanos movie. He's the first big (I told you everything was big), bad, nearly omnipotent villain. It should be noted that Thanos sees himself as misunderstood, which leads to the second key point: melodrama abounds - moreso than any previous comic book movie. It seems to be reminding us that Superheroes are people too (but are they really?). The third point is that if every character with a speaking part simply said \"I am Spartacus\", it would still likely be the longest ever comic book movie. There are at least 28 characters with \"key\" roles - and that's not counting the end credit stinger, or the missing characters we thought we would see, or the one that gets a logo tease as a coming attraction for part 2.  Co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus had their hands full in working to come up with a coherent story, while allowing so many familiar characters to have at least one moment in the spotlight, if not a few. The fact that AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR divided the group actually allows for multiple segments to play out concurrently. Though we never doubt these fragmented cliques and isolated individuals will fight to save the galaxy, that doesn't necessarily mean they get the band back together. In fact, it's the Guardians of the Galaxy who are a much more cohesive group than our beloved Avengers. But fear not ... there is plenty of fighting and action to go around. Thanos claims he is saving many interplanetary civilizations and restoring balance with his plan to eliminate half of all living beings. While there might be some scientific evidence to back up his plan, it doesn't sit well with the good guys. More focus is given to his cravings for ultimate control and power provided by tracking down all six Infinity Stones (Tesseract/Space, Mind, Time, Power, Reality, and Soul) to complete his Infinity Gauntlet. Many of these stones are in quite inconvenient locations and require some ingenuity and brute force from Thanos. Perhaps the travel agent had the biggest challenge as portions of the film take place in New York City, Knowhere, and Wakanda (good luck finding a brochure on those last two). We also get a budding romance from Vision and Scarlet Witch, as well as annoying quasi-romantic banter between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. And while we are on the \"TMZ\" portion of the review, it should be noted that both Black Widow and Captain America (introducing himself as Steve Rogers) both have new hair styles - though only one of them sports a beard.  In the realm of comic book movies, this would be considered an epic. It has stunning action sequences, remarkable special effects and some terrific comedy mixed in. Of course, you'll have to accept the melodramatic emotions and fear that we haven't been previously subjected, and know that the final finality doesn't arrive for another year. It's very long (more than 2 \u00bd hours) but it seems to go pretty quickly. The filmmakers have mostly succeeded in the monumental task of remaining true to the history in order to keep comic book fans satisfied, while also creating something that most should be entertained by. Despite lacking the upbeat, feel-good ending we've grown accustomed to, there is a welcome Stan Lee cameo, a post credit stinger (after about 10 minutes of rolling credits). And to top it off, we get \"Rubberband Man\" from The Spinners. Now that's big!", "The film was 1000/10 and people who gave 1-2-3 are stupid. They are probably dc fans and probably didn't understand a thing from the movie.", "Overall this was a good movie; however, there were some issues. It was rushed, and some of the heroes were extremely annoying. But there were still some really awesome aspects to this movie. To start, this movie was extremely rushed. Thanos collected all of the infinity stones so quickly. It was cool to see how he was able to collect them all with the exception of one- the power stone. I thought this was really annoying because it took away from the origin story of Thanos. There were some characters that were great in previous movies but were super annoying in this one. Star-Lord is number one on the list. He was selfish and he was compromised. He did not care about the team when they could have defeated Thanos. Vision is number two, and he is arguably the most useless character in all of the Avenger movies. He literally does nothing. He has an infinity stone, the mind stone, yet he is the most weak-minded Avenger. He offers zero significance to the story. There was a fight between Hulk and Thanos, and it was awesome! Any screen time that Hulk gets is usually something worth watching. He was able to hold up his own, but I felt bad once Thanos started to use the power stone against him. I did not think that he could get hurt. It reminded me of the end of the fight scene between Batman and Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. This fight scene was probably the best part of the movie. It was exciting to see Red Skull- finally! The last he was seen was at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger. He was sucked up, into space, but we did not know by who.  There was also a lot of humor between Thor and Drax the Destoryer. They kept the movie funny in their own dry humorous ways. Speaking of Thor, he was incredibly awesome in this movie. He had lost so much throughout his time with the Avengers; he was driven by his vengeance and in a crazy way, it was well deserved to see him like that. Many of the heroes will die in this movie. I will not say who, but some of the ones who die is such a disappointment and unexpected. It left a bitter taste at the end of the movie. Once part four comes out, I believe this movie rating will be higher. But by itself, it is much lower. I do not like it when a movie leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. It will leave you with many unanswered questions.", "... it's called \"overpopulation?\" You probably haven't heard of it because people don't like to talk about it, and this movie fails to address it, either. It's nonsense that the *physical universe* as opposed to *this planet* could be subject to overpopulation ... but, that's what happens when you run out of ideas, or something. These 8 (eight?) rings will disintegrate some of the universe, or something. Don't let them fall into the wrong hands, or something. So, you're sitting there, like ... \"you know, fly to the moon, go to Mars, or something, but ... why?\" So, you gotta buy it. Plus people from other movies. Plus *more* people from other movies! Yay! Never has there been so much \"gosh, let's show up!\" with no sense of peril. I mean, the movie's never boring, but are you ever really worried? And then the credits run. And I'm like, \"oh ... oh, really?\"", "So, I know these guys did Winter Soldier (which I liked a lot). However, this movie was really rough. I have been a fan of Dr. Strange since the 70's and I thought Marvel did a great job of portraying how powerful Strange is in his movie and also in Thor Ragnarok. However, in Infinity War they absolutely NERFed Dr. Strange to the point at which it was painful to watch. They did the same to Scarlett Witch (another uberpowerful character from what I remember). What were they thinking? Were the writers/directors just unfamiliar with these characters? What a disappointment.", "Started watching this last night, stopped half way through as I couldn't stay awake, finished watching it this morning.

Hey, guess what, the unoriginal script is based on a series of comics from the 90's, there's nothing really new here, except for the unfortunate lack of key Characters (mainly Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock) wich are too deep to be presented on this movie (case of Adam) or belong to other studior (case of Silver Surfer, the Fantastic Four, X-men), and the writers need to make a few changes, but that's all. I guess no one is dumb enough to think that everyone that died in the movie, will remain dead. Marvel doesn't think we are that stupid as well, cause guardians of the galaxy 3 is confirmed to 2020.  I'm sorry to say, but this kind of review, saying the script is unoriginal e full of obvious deaths and turn arounds, is very, very stupid.  It's like watching a biography, and complain about it, because you knew what was going to hapen, even before watching the movie.", "There were a lot of great things about this film, Thanos being the highlight of the film, but still it did feel a little crammed at times. Some things about this film were overdramatised And it felt at times there was too much going on.  Saying that though on a pure enjoyment and plot scale this film does almost everything right. It was not predictable which meant there was genuine surprise for the plot twists. Overall Marvel have done a good job with this movie bar a few details but still a great movie overall.", "Disney's latest Marvel Studios' blockbuster superhero epic \"Avengers: Infinity War\" finally gives us a villain we not only can love but also loath with equal passion because he considers himself the epitome of mercy. Few supervillains share Thanos' warped point of view as well as his staggering supremacy. After several cameos in earlier Marvel epics, the long-awaited Thanos devastates everybody and everything in his path like an apocalypse. Just about every Marvel superhero shows up to hamper this doomsday juggernaut from looting the universe for those six ultra-powerful Infinity Stones that auger ill for the future. \"Captain America: Winter Soldier\" and \"Captain America: Civil War\" co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo and \"Captain America\" co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have delivered a sequel that indisputably surpasses its predecessors, but it is debatable that Marvel can elevate the stakes much higher in later sequels for a villain as formidable as Thanos. Moreover, the greatest criticism many may raise is that their favorite Marvel superhero may have been short changed in this saga owing to a lack of time to streamline everybody into the storyline.  Actually, most of the superheroes have more than enough time, while the peripheral entities, like Loki, perish in the first scene and those that ensue. Clocking in at a marathon two hours and 36 minutes, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" will challenge anybody's bladder. Unless you're a dialysis patient, you'll have to schedule your departures, so you'll miss either the least amount of high-octane action or expository dialogue. Back in the good ole days, Hollywood provided audiences with intermissions to purge their urges. Problem is the brothers Russo and their scenarists never squander a second in their narrative. Perhaps somebody will create an app that will enable us via Wi-Fi to watch on our smart phones what will would normally miss during flights to and from the lavatory. Meantime, the Russo Brothers maintain a straightforward, serious tone throughout this superhero mash-up, sprinkling the action with amusing quips, especially about Wakanda possibly getting a Starbucks Coffee Shop since Black Panther wants to open his homeland up to the world. No, \"Avengers Infinity War\" isn't a parody like \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" Despite its abundant length, the filmmakers take enough time to update certain characters, such as Thor, and give us glimpses into the past about how Thanos saved a young Gamora. What may dishearten some Marvel fans is Thanos doesn't take a licking. Instead, he delivers the licking, taking down virtually every Marvel champion as irrevocably as a bowling ball smashing ten-pins during a strike.  \"Avengers' Infinity War\" picks up where \"Thor: Ragnarok\" left off. Thanos (Josh Brolin) boards the Asgardian spaceship with the Ragnarok survivors. Incidentally, he wears a helmet and uniform in a nod to Jim Starlin's graphic novel \"The Infinity Gauntlet\" (1991). He wears a massive gauntlet on his left fist that will eventually be encrusted with six stones. Thanos sheds the helmet. He vanquishes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) in brief but brutal combat. He tortures Thor for the whereabouts of the Tesseract, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) reluctantly surrenders it. Not only does Thanos dispatch Loki but also Heimdall. Before Heimdall (Idris Elba) dies, he summons the Bifrost and hurtles Hulk back to Earth. Once he possesses the Space stone, Thanos destroys the ship. Meantime, Hulk plunges into New York City. He has reverted to Bruce Banner. Worst, he cannot conjure up the Hulk. Thanos' cronies invade New York. They hover above the Big Apple in a colossal ring-shaped spacecraft. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is riding in a school bus, driven by Marvel honcho Stan Lee in his inevitable cameo, when this monstrosity appears over Manhattan. Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-man, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) tangle with these sinister extraterrestrials that want Strange's Time stone. Eventually, our superheroes stow away onboard the departing alien ship, and Spider-man discovers that his new suit helps him survive. More of Thanos' toadies rampage into Scotland to bring back the Mind stone embedded in Vision's forehead. Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) fights alongside Vision (Paul Bettany) to repulse these wicked adversaries.  In a riff on the rescue mission in \"Alien,\" the Guardians of the Galaxy receive a distress call. When they reach the scene of the destruction, they can only save Thor. The Guardians split into two groups, and Rocket Raccoon and Groot accompany Thor to the planet Nidavellir, where Eitri (Peter Dinklage) forges a replacement battle-axe christened Stormbreaker, so the son of Odin can intervene in a life-and-death fracas back on Earth in Wakanda. Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) confront more of Thanos' subhuman armies out to get 'the Mind Stone.' The creation of Thor's new hammer is exhilarating stuff. No matter what this army of superheroes does, Thanos manages to subjugate them at every turn. Eventually, once he has acquired all six stones, the Titan snaps his fingers, and half of the universe expires like dust in the wind. Barnes, Black Panther, Groot, Scarlet Witch, Mantis, Drax, Star Lord, Dr. Strange, and Spider-man dissolve into smoke. At one point, our heroes nearly relieve Thanos of the Infinity gauntlet, until Star Lord infuriates the purple giant. Ultimately, Iron Man, Thor, Banner, Rocket Raccoon, Captain America, and Black Widow survive this frightening Armageddon. Anybody familiar with Jim Starlin's \"The Infinity Gauntlet,\" the film's ostensible source material, knows the graphic novel and film share few similarities. For example, in the Starlin's \"Gauntlet,\" Thanos has acquired all six infinity gems from the start. Conversely, in the movie, Thanos embarks on a scavenger hunt for these essential crystals. The film jettisons Thanos' futile infatuation with Mistress Death. More than thirty superheroes wind up on casualty list, and the Earth is catapulted out of orbit. Nevertheless, everything that Thanos did was undone. The biggest surprise about \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the triumph of Thanos over the heroes. Presumably, the sequel will undo the evil Titan's victory.", "Everything was almost perfect. The cast, the villain, the fight sequences, it all happened like a dream. The humour was good too. The ending was not only touching but also kept me craving for the second part of the movie.", "The birth of the first 'Super Villain' in Marvel universe just happened.  Finally someone who can really kick literally any superhero ass and walk away unscathed with \u00e9lan. \nWith every passing minute of the movie - you end up liking Thanos more and more. \nAfter the 'Civil war' - superheroes on earth are broken into pieces and scattered around earth - and the mightiest of all foes steps in to fight them in groups. \nThe only superhero who really stands up to Thanos is Stark - and majestic as Thanos is , he respects Stark.  The movie - is a long but thoroughly enjoyable one. Guardians of galaxy step in and will have you chuckling every now and then - apart from the witty remarks of Stark and Spider-Man.  Highly recommended for the comic fans.  Most impressive superhero - Tony Stark. \nLeast impressive superhero - Vision (he literally does nothing but lay around and lament)  Highlight and spotlight of the movie stolen by : Thanos!  PS: I like villains - not heroes.", "They really hit this one out of the park. I had some concerns, the trailers made it look like a typical save-the-world storyline, and Avengers 2 was terrible. But man I was completely wrong, this was great and mostly thanks to the villain Thanos, who is one of the better movie antagonists in recent memory and probably the best MCU villain (except perhaps Killmonger). He is cunning, ruthless, and physically very powerful. Marvel villains are usually foils to the heroes, and only exist for the hero to defeat them and learn more about himself in the process. Here, Thanos is a fully fleshed out character who experiences a range of emotions and spends a large part of the movie on his own personal odyssey. He shares surprisingly little screentime with the Avengers (he sends his minions instead) and there is little gloating, cackling or lame quips. When they do clash, they are mere obstacles to be swatted away rather than his genuine rivals. Taking the action away from Earth and into the cosmos allowed for very imaginative and psychedelic battles. There is a battle on an alien planet that could be ripped straight from the comic books. I had some problems with the ending and the usual Marvel humour got a little tiresome at times, but other than that this was as close to a perfect comic book movie as you will likely get.", "This made me wet. I'm really wet by the movie because it was quality. Such talent, integrity, determination to appease the audience whether mentally or sexually. Definitely a must see for all ages. Warning: expect abnormal sexual arousements.", "Honestly this movie is equivalent to Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows Part 1. (An awful movie in the series)\nYes (as all other reviewers who given it an 8 or higher have argued) this movie has had a lot of build up and it is meant to be the \"final\" act; however that doesn't excuse it's inability to create an interesting plot.\nSimilar to HPDH1, this movie focuses too much on setting up for part 2 that is seems like this was more of a money grab.\nIt is a movie worth seeing but perhaps not in theaters.\nI suggest, have more self control than me and wait until the second part comes out so you can immediately gain some closure that the first part fails to achieve.", "This movie is a lot of fun and it has great moments. It is a delight to see the crossover of Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers meet to battle the veiled villain of the last decade in the Marvel Universe. But IMO: Thanos is not the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe. His motivation is not that awesome - and in a way - by making the universe hang in the balance the film raised the stakes so high it was difficult to really care or believe. There is no real drama at the end because like any comic book...the character's will return. However - the fights are great fun. So - like any great crossover...it was big and loud but not as good as a single edition adventure.", "Infinity War manages to be coherent despite the over-abundance of characters. It seemed hard, but somehow all the heroes (or almost all) have their role. \nAnd while I find the fact that most of the other MCU films are required material to watch this one disagreeable, it does feel like an appropriate culmination of all the previous adventures.\nThe action is of course great, the stakes higher than ever, and the humour really good, especially among the Guardians of the Galaxy. There are of course glaring weaknesses in the plot - 6 super magical stones that control the entire universe are all just around the corner. Starlord can't control himself for half a second till they remove Thanos' super-glove. But let's face it, it's a superhero film, and a self-aware one at that: when Iron Man explains \"he is from space, here to steal a necklace from a wizard\", you can't complain for such details. It is telling to the film's success how Thanos manages to come off as a genuinely thoughtful and not-entirely-evil villain, even though his philosophy is entirely stupid: he has diagnosed the entire universe's problem to be overpopulation, and thinks killing half of all life (no other measures) will fix everything, because apparently reproduction isn't a thing. I mean, it's a profoundly silly plan for an immortal mega-genius, but kudos to Josh Brolin for managing to hide that. Of course, the film does end on a 'to be continued' note, so we'll have to wait for the final judgment.", "Already seen it twice, will see again in the theater next week\nThanos is badass!!\nthis movie is the greatest even exceeding IMO Jurassic Park 1, Star Wars I-VI, The God Father, Batman Nolan\nabsolutely great!!", "I went into the theatre almost being prepared to be disappointed. Just because it was part 1 and a lot of times the first part of movies aren't the greatest. But wow! This movie blew me away. Is was really great. There were sad moments, but also comedic relief that didn't make it come across like they were fitting to many genre's in one movie. The end of the movie will shock you and make you realize that marvel movies can still surprise you. They really put a twist on things that you won't expect. So if your iffy about seeing it because you were disappointed in Civil War. Don't be. The abundance of characters did not ruin the movie at all. I highly reccomend WATCH THIS MOVIE.", "I gotta say hands down on from beginning to end of this movie. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest to take yourself and a friend, girlfriend, family, or all and treat yourself to some popcorn, drinks, and candy to the best MCU movie that's out now.", "Avengers Infinity War was far from the best movie ever made but is a pretty great, the visual effects were beyond amazing, the character interactions were great, the performances are wonderful, and then their is Thanos who is by far an amazing villain, one of the best villains ever and the best Marvel villain, surprisingly the story was well done, and the 3rd act is where the meat and potatoes are, not going to spoil anything but it's not like any of the other Marvel movies. And by That right there, You get the best Marvel movie.", "1 May 2018\nFilm of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Avengers: Infinity War. Never has there been such an assemblage of notables in one film, and never it seems has one film taken so much money at the box office in its first weekend. Let's face it, this is not just one film\"......it's taken us ten years to get here, ten years of Marvel wowing us with good, not so good and fairly awesome film, ten years to introduce us to all their heroes and villains and I have to say, if you're going to put them all in one film......this is surely the way to do it. Some of our early heroes are ageing but what's a little make up between friends and well hey it blinkin works. This film is not a single story, it's a gathering of many tales told in many different ways, with all paths heading on a collision course. I can't tell anything of the plot without massive spoilers but what I can say is, it's great meeting all the characters again, spending a couple of minutes fitting their individual pieces into one massive jigsaw as you remember what their role is in the story, and another thing, it made me want to go back and watch all the other films again. This is a film you'll want to watch again and again I'm sure........oh and people....it's Marvel, stay until the end of the credits!!!!", "Best movie ever seen in my life , ohhh baby what an outstanding STORYLINE, CGI , ACTING ,, everything in this movie is THE BEST ,, the movie will definitely make cry if you are a REAL MARVEL FAN , this movie is very very deferent than other avenger movies, i'd give it more than 10/10 if I could \"IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND DEFINITELY\"", "I think the heading says it all. Honestly though, one of the best movies made.", "The best Series avengers all of time, i'm very enjoyed at i wacht it.", "Thanos(voiced by Josh Brolin) is searching for the Infinity Stones for his Gauntlet that could bring such incredible power for him, and he will stop at nothing to get it. And all the Avengers will have to come up with a plan to stop him, but will they before it's too late? \nThis film is what Marvel fans have been waiting for, most all the characters from the marvel universe in one film is a big treat, and the Thanos character is very menacing, and there toughest opponent, but I like the way he was portrayed has not just a one noted character, and CGI did not look fake. Everybody who has a little story of there own here, and they all play there parts well, you really invested in there plots. Action scenes are quite well shot. Keeps me with excitement for what new Marvel project coming next.", "Before you move on this review contains spoilers.\n.\nOkay, this movie, by far, is one of the best movies from the MCU. It has a very decent fighting choreography, the acting is really good (surprisingly) and the plot unfolds with style. no long talking sequences to explain what is going on and no advanced computers/weapons to save the day (as is the case with most of the MCU movies). However, this movie might come as a disappointment when the upcoming movies are revealed. since Marvel won't really kill more than half their characters just like that, there IS a way to bring them back. I felt happy that Marvel actually found the courage to kill some of its characters (happy that things finally got serious, but not happy that the character died), but then, in that post-credit scene, I felt a little disappointment. that scene indicates that some hero (Captain Marvel) is comming to save the day. and given the announced future MCU movies (they shouldn't have announced them too soon, they made things too obvious) which includes some of the characters who died in infinity war, all clues says that they will come back. whether they will come back from the dead, some other hidden dimension thing, I'm still not sure. Also, try to separate between the people who died during the movie and the people who died in the end. During the movie, Loki, Heimdall, and Gamora have died due to natural causes. Unlike the others, who died due to some super powers from the infinity gauntlet carrying the six stones. so there is a fair chance that most of these characters will return.\nBut let's not cloud our judgement by the upcoming movies. Infinity war, on its own, is a great film. But I think it is about time Marvel dropped the super technology mumbo jumbo they always fall back too as a Deus-Ex Machina when the situation gets too dire. And I really want them to get rid of Natasha Romanoff, her ability to fight super strength villians and withstand explosions and strong impacts while she has no powers at all is seriously ridiculous.", "I couldn't appreciate this movie as much as a Marvel fan would because I'm not familiar with many of the Marvel superheroes. That said, I still don't understand why this movie is getting such high IMDb ratings. I'll take an X-Men movie over an Avengers flick every time.", "The plot, the characters, the acting, the effects, everything was on point! Go see it!", "This is the most important movie in world it is incredible and amazing movie", "With many people speaking about superhero fatigue when it comes to watching movies on the big screen, you'd think that we'd be in a box office drought by now. Obviously, that isn't coming anytime soon, because as long as this Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to surprise its fans and become one of the longest-running franchises in film history, I can't see myself ever losing interest. The hype surrounding this film is massive and arguably the largest ever, due to the sheer notion that people have been watching this series for the last ten years.  Nobody could've expected them to make it this far and be this grand, but have they ever done it with this one. Avengers: Infinity War marks the 19th film in this franchise and easily has the most storylines happening at the same time, but if I said I didn't have an absolute blast watching this movie, then I would be lying. From an emotional end to some very funny and exciting action sequences, here's why I loved my experience of this film. This is the type of movie that will be ruined for those who choose to know more about the core premise than they are given at first. Honestly, every ten minutes brings a surprise that leads into the next scene, so it's very difficult to discuss this movie in depth. That being said, Thanks has finally arrived and plans on wiping out half of humanity in order to bring balance to the universe. Pretty much at random, he will select the half that he wishes to live or die. To do this, his mission is to track down six infinity stones that will allow him to accomplish this with the snap f his fingers. Any other information would ruin this experience for you, so I'll leave it at that. As far as the characters go, that's probably consecutively the biggest positive and negative that this film has to offer. Yes, seeing everyone is amazing and some of the interactions were the most welcomed portions of the film, but there are times when the movie does seem a little overly ambitious in including everyone that it possibly can. There are a few members left out of the movie, and I personally feel they did that in order to leave room to breathe during this installment. With that said, I personally just enjoyed seeing everyone and didn't let the overload of characters bother me. Throughout the years, whether it was starting fresh with a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy or jumping into Iron Man 3 without having seen the rest of the movies, newcomers could've easily figured out the missing pieces. Avengers: Infinity War doesn't quite game that same effect, solely due to the fact that there are callbacks and blatant references to films at the very beginning of the franchise. So yes, my recommendation would be to see every movie in the series in order to be fully connected to the events of this movie. For fans of this universe, I don't believe they could've received a more satisfying climax. From Robert Downey Jr. to Tom Holland, Elizabeth Olsen to Benedict Cumberbatch, the spectrum of performances is on another level here. Everyone is devoted to these characters, but the true standout is easily the performance of Josh Brolin as Thanos. I have a feeling that everyone will be talking about him as the most fleshed out villain this franchise will ever see. His backstory and motivation definitely bring a needed layer to this movie and everyone else gets their time to shine as well. This is a crowd-pleasing movie that also takes risks that I don't think people will be expecting. In the end, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most satisfying theatrical experiences I've had in quite some time. From the running time being the longest one yet and feeling pretty fast, to the climax of the movie leaving me quite emotional, to wondering about where they could possibly go next, to the sheer notion of seeing this many characters on-screen at the same time and it not feeling too bloated, I loved my entire experience of this film. Aside from it feeling a little overstuffed at times, Joe and Anthony Russo have crafted yet another fantastic entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was also a joy to hear the score from The Avengers making a comeback as well. For fans of the franchise, I can't recommend this movie enough. For newcomers, make sure you've at least seen most of the movies. This is a wonderful blockbuster.", "Infinity War was very predictable for us who read the comics, that is a small critic. Dinklage was out of place, Black Widow felt unnecessary, and Hulk was mistreated horribly. A lot of things was missing as well, and a few decisions did not really work.  With that said though it was fantastic entertainment, great movie experience, and top 5 marvel movie.  Also if you are a green party member and you want to kill humans because in your psychotic world there are too many people, you will love this movie beyond compare. One of the most entertaining movies ever made and a fantastic superhero movie, but as a movie (in general) it had too many problems to get top grade.", "Avengers: Infinity War (5 out of 5 stars). Avengers: Infinity War is an epic awesome fun superhero film that is basically the climatic battle of the MCU that has been leading up to this since the very first Iron Man movie. And surprisingly, it does not disappoint. Marvel has been doing well with its storytelling over 19 superhero movies and counting. And every one has been giving hints of the infinity stones or a big bad villain that will soon arrive like Thanos. And Thanos is the groundbreaking villain that will shake the line up of heroes and possibly changing the direction of the rest of the MCU.  The plot follows right after the events of Thor: Ragnarok. Thor and Loki and the rest of the Asgardians come across Thanos. And his desire for hunting down every Infinity Stone to annihilate half of the universe. Meanwhile on Earth, Doctor Strange and Iron Man face against danger that lands with Thano's adoptive children who are searching for the remaining stones on Earth. While, the Guardians of the Galaxy are on a race against time on trying to stop Thanos from reaching the final stone.  The plot had the Avengers getting separated into their own adventures. Yes, it involves trying to protect the stones or racing against time to find them before he gets it. You have Spider Man, Doc Strange, and Iron Man taking the fight on Thanos home planet. Rocket, Groot, and Thor searching for a weapon. The rest of the Guardians are trying to stop Thanos. Then, Captain America, Black Panther, and Scarlett Witch trying to protect the remaining stone on Earth. Characters were everywhere and had there own objective. Thanos is a villain that is set on world domination. And the writers did add a little emotion to his character and his reasoning behind his motivations of destroying everything. He is the force of nature that will test every Avenger. Sure, some may complain that there are too many characters. Yes, there is. But the writers tried to keep a well-balanced screen time on giving every character enough progression to the story. Which makes this 2 and half hour running time feeling pretty short when several characters are on a different journey that eventually crosses paths.  The visual effects and action sequences are plenty throughout and exciting. It is epic. The first ten minutes with Thanos threatening characters and attacking does leave you with chills. There are some awe, shocking, and haunting moments. And some fun humor with characters interacting with each other. When you get so many high ego heroes in one spot together can be hilarious. And than you have the Guardians which they always light up the mood. Every character has a spot to shine with the fight sequences. Then, an epic climatic battle in Wakanda. And the final moments of the film is pretty haunting. Which may leave the audience talking once the credits roll. This shocking cliffhangar does leave you hanging for the next Avengers movie. Especially, on where the direction can go next. Which is best to avoid all spoilers and media to see for yourself.  Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is a great superhero film. The plot is epic. Our heroes go through several exciting action set pieces to face against the ultimate villain. The film does have a huge cast ensemble as it is. And every one does get their fair share of screen time. Except for a couple of characters that were absent in this film (there roles are probably saved for the fourth film). The visual effects are amazing. And the action sequences are plenty throughout. There is a lot of action from beginning to end to keep you on the edge of your seat. Especially, when characters lives are at stake. The film does end with a shocking cliffhanger, which will leave you pondering on where the fourth Avengers movie will go.  I recommend seeing this film on the big screen. If you seen any of the MCU movies or the previous Avengers film. This is definitely one of the best movies and the climatic part of the Marvel universe. Also, stay tune for the final post credit scene which is an important set up for the next Marvel chapter.", "Possibly the greatest movie i have Ever seen...yes you need to see the previous films all 18 of them, but this really is start to finish an epic film. And best part is...it's not over", "Thoroughly entertaining and gut wrenching! I loved the juxtaposition of the different character worlds coming together.", "You are not prepared. You may believe you are, even if you have seen every trailer, every TV spot, every leaked set photo, you are not prepared for the Infinity War. All has led to this. A spoiler free analysis follows. \nPreviously I've been blogging a series of retrospective posts chronicling the past films that are a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), their impact on the larger narrative, and discussing Marvel's growth as a film studio over the past 10 years and 18 films. Ever increasing budgets aside, the films have grown ever larger in their grander context of the larger scope of the MCU. An early criticism was the way they sloppily shoehorned connections between films, which has matured to become a subtle art of careful structure. Avengers Infinity War, however, is fully aware that the connective tissue strewn about the past 18 films has always had one end game, the villain Thanos, and his enigmatic ultimate goal. This review will not have any story spoilers beyond what has been shown in the first trailer released what seems like so very long ago. This is important to note as seeing the film with eyes as fresh as possible is a requirement not exclusively meant for the rabbid fans that have been clamouring for this film since they first cracked open a comic book in their youth, but as it turns out, also the unwashed masses who may have only seen a smattering of previous films. You may have only seen Black Panther, or been here since the first Iron Man, but the story will still surprise you and overwhelm you with emotions, as even though knowledge of the previous films is a pre-requisite to fully engaging with the story, the writers have so perfectly crafted the narrative as to add weight and substance to every scene, even if you may not know the intricately detailed back story to a character's actions. This applies even to Thanos, the big bad originally teased in the first Avengers so very long ago, the Mad Titan's motivation is so skillfully manifested throughout the film as to make him a sympathetic character, you of course won't agree with his methods but you will come to understand his reasons so clearly that it puts so many comic book movie baddies to shame. Avengers Infinity War is unquestionably the biggest superhero film ever put before celluloid, or in this case, IMAX cameras. It's notable that this is the first Hollywood production to be shot entirely using IMAX cameras, cameras known for being used most often for nature documentaries due to the unrivalled visual fidelity and highly engrossing aspect ratio that pulls the viewer into any given scene. This is no less true for Avengers, the film is very obviously designed with the large aspect ratio IMAX presents as each shot beautifully paints a larger than life image, as needed for such larger than life characters. Characters, who after all this time, are still receiving incredible depth of development even though they share the screen with upwards of 60 total characters. And the way the film juggles so many characters vying for screen time in such disparate circumstances is a master class in story telling and film editing. As a fan of all things geeky, specifically superheroes, and most specifically the MCU, of which I have seen each film many times over and already had my tickets to see Infinity War a second time before having even seen it once, I knew I would like this movie, I was ready to crown it my new favourite comic book movie, period. However, I can momentarily put aside my Hulk sized bias and state objectively that the film works, and against all odds. It takes the narrative promises it's laid out the last 10 years and weaves them so deftly as to seem effortless. You will laugh, you will cry, you will gasp in utter disbelief, and then immediately buy another ticket on your way out.", "I think this movie is one of the best of MCU in many words is AMAZING, I really love it and if you love Marvel characters you will cry a lot", "Just amazing,so amazing! I walked out the movie theater with a broken jaw \nJust so fun to watch and crazy how they mad this film just so amazing!", "Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger After 10 years of character and plot building, we finally get what we have been waiting for. Infinity War is a film of epic proportion that makes first Avengers film look like a small feat. Infinity War has a complex story filled with exquisite fight sequences, humor, and amazing characters. The biggest hurdle for this film was fitting in a lot of characters in only two and a half hours. Anthony and Joe Russo successfully give all the characters a fair amount of screen time and introduces use to the amazingly effective Thanos. The story is filled with emotional moments and has some power when it comes to the reality of Thanos' power. The acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Zoe Saldana, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, and many others perform very well. Josh Brolin performs the best in my eyes. He plays Thanos who is extremely complex and is the second-best superhero villain I have ever witnessed behind The Joker. Thanos truly is the best part of the film in my eyes.  The pacing is perfect. Infinity War throws us into the action immediately and doesn't let up. The runtime is also perfect. There are a couple of things I didn't like in the film. Peter Dinklage's character looked rather foolish. His accent and the way his character looked made him seem fake. I also didn't like the Wakanda scenes. Their accents are extremely annoying, in my eyes, and some the characters in Wakanda are kinda cringy.  All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is a masterclass superhero film. It is the second-best superhero film ever made right behind Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I truly loved it and I am really excited for part two. Pros: Intense, emotional, and heartbreaking story, good humor, amazing characters, very good acting, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Thanos being one of the greatest movie villains ever, great pacing, a good runtime, and how Thanos is a really effective villain throughout the entire film Cons: Peter Dinklage's character is and looks bad and most of the Wakanda scenes and characters are kinda cringy Overall Rating: 9.5 P.S. I would recommend watching all the MCU's movies before watching this film. If you don't want to watch them all just watch these: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, and Thor: Ragnarok. This list leaves out seven Marvel films that should be watched but could be skipped. Enjoy!", "Don't listen to reviews, go off the internet even don't watch the trailers and don't contact many people, coz this is a movie u should only watch as a comic book fan or an mceu fan if you have followed their storylines until this point. Watch it just for the pure joy of being at the movies, no pros no cons no analysis, just watch it for once and sit back for a while to just feel the amount of emotions run through you.\nIt's an exceedingly overwhelming movie. And all credit must go to the makers of this movie here Marvel, Russo brothers, marcus and mcfeely, and all the technical staff. This is a huge dream not only we as audiences watched but Marvel also watched, which came alive in a grand fashion here on celluloid.\nMovie delivers on all aspects ,expectations, excitement, thrills and even a lot of chills.\nAs lots of surprises and shocks coming your way so, don't try to figure out much coz you won't be able to guess, unless you want spoilers.\nTrust me it will affect you very deeply but for good for the most part.", "This is one, or the best marvel movie of all times. I was on the edge of my seat. Lots of moments that gave me goosebumps. Felt like a 10 year old kid. If this movie doesn't win an Oscar, the Oscars are fake news.", "Wow. I just got out of a Thursday night premier, and i have to say... I haven't had a pit of dread in my stomach leaving a Marvel movie before. Ever.  The rest of the movie is great, meaningful action and development happens, it's all great. But the final stretch... It's a doozy. Like I said in the title, whatever theories you have about the end... Just throw them away. Walk into this movie with an open mind and try and prepare yourself. This is the darkest Marvel movie so far. I'm anxious to see what the Russo brothers do with Part II next year because I don't know what they're doing at all. It's great, but you will leave this film feeling emotionally ripped to shreds. And it happens like a punch in the gut.  I've already said too much. Go into it without any spoilers, if you can, and just prepare yourself for Thanos.", "Avengers IW did not disappoint, from the beginning I was on the edge of my seat and was like that the whole movie it is action packed and has a good story. Thanos absolutely steals the show, The way he beat up on the Hulk was amazing because it quickly showed that he was on another level, He was the best MCU villain to date and is up there with Heath Ledgers joker. He believed that what he was doing was right, and didn't let anyone get in his way and of course the Finger Snap!!! Yes it happened erasing a bunch of characters we all love.  Problems I had\n", "Stay at the end for the teaser!!!! Do not leave it's worth it.", "After watching Infinity War last night my heart still hasn't dropped to under 100 bpm. The movie is breathtakingly beautiful, and will make you feel almost every emotion possible. The Russo brothers did an amazing job balancing the enormous cast, and made a movie which scale has never been scene before! The movie is entertaining from the first minute, and will leave you with your jaw on the floor.\nMy only regret is, that every time I will watch a movie in the future, I will compare it to Infinity War, and I am afraid it won't even be close", "My word - what an amazing treat it was ... can't wait till the next one. Didn't know how 149 minutes went. Was so glued to the screen and didn't want the movie to end. Jaw dropping climax with a little bit of emotions at the end.", "One of the best movies i've ever seen definitely the best of marvel. thanos is just awesome super villain...thank you marvel for this masterpiece!", "This is not epic. This is not cool or amazing. It's more than that. This film is everything. I got dragged from laughing to crying, from here till the other side of the universe and back. When I left the cinema today, I was blown away. No film has ever caught me like this.  Everyone should go to the cinema and enjoy the film there. Not only because they deserve it. But because of the experience you get. It's a rollercoaster. This film is so much better than the trailer, the trailer is like one percent of the whole film. So much happening, so much things you forgot existed is there. So many people, so many plottwists. And Thanos. Boy. That man is insane. Please go to the cinema, you won't be disappointed. I wish I could tell you everything. I can't. Yet. #thanosdemandsyoursilence", "Okay, so I kinda have two initial reactions here.\nThe first is that with all the hype, sheer number of characters, cross-over story lines and preceding history I was worried that the Russo brothers would miss the mark and at the very least deliver a shonky mess. In my opinion they didn't and as a result, as a fan of comics, the MCU and movies in general, I came out of the cinema feeling that I had seen a well balanced, by-the-fans-for-the-fans, culmination of work that satisfied me on most levels. But as Austin Powers said \"Having said that, I do have some thoughts...\" When Avengers 3 & 4 were announced years ago, along with a plethora of other movies in the MCU, they were subtitled Part 1 & 2 respectively. Then some time ago, next years \"Part 2\" was adjusted to \"Untitled Avengers Movie\", leaving us with the feeling that this one would wrap up the current Infinity Gems story-line and that the fourth installment would be a completely new direction/ adventure for the team. Without giving away the ending, this movie does leave it open for resolution in next years Avengers 4, and I can understand given the known history of this story in the comics that the studio wanted to try and maintain some of the element of surprise for us diehard fans. So for their efforts in that department, I thank you. On a final note, I'm aware that this is not Ben Hur, The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption etc. It isn't meant to be of that calibre. It does hit the mark right where it is supposed to, with only a few minor wobbles along the way and that, my friends, is pretty darn good in this day and age.", "Really enjoyed this film, but was as heartbreaking for the characters as the trailer suggested. The first five minutes was defiantly the most emotional for me, and the last five.\nIt has some of the common super hero movie flaws, but for once not every character got out of the intense battles with their pristine shirts and perfect hair intact. We will see how many of the characters that did die Come back in the next avengers film. If you do watch this prepare to wait a year for the next film, as it ends rather badly for all characters in the MCU.  Hawkeye and Antman were frustratingly absent in this film, they were mentioned but nothing more.  And SPOILER but Loki is not one of the bad guys, something that I for one rejoiced at, although that was very short lived. He fought against Thanos and with Thor.", "Its ky first review on IMBD. Im not a Pro but just sharing my feedback. 5-Stars showing Generousity for the heqvy budget of the movie. Watched this movie in 4D and yet didnt like it.\nGood action as you expect from any Marvel movie.\nBut the story is crap. Revolves around a negative character-Thanos. The characters travel various planets and fight meaninglessly ultimately losing all the Stones to Thanos and he disappears the heroes in climax. After all this meaningless action and dark gloomy 2 and a half hours of suffering,the movie ends abruptly forcing us to watch the next installment of the movie. To sum up: good action no story no comedy no entertainment!", "This was coming off of streaming on Netflix and not to return because of Disney. It's part of our popular culture, so I just felt I had to experience it and know what other people are referring to. I grew up with \"Star Wars\", which dates me. The visual effects in this movie are truly mind-boggling. I'm not going to write a long review though, because from the point of view of biology and philosophy, from beginning to end the plot is total nonsense. I'll admit it's got some funny lines though scattered throughout. Personally, I'd be totally embarrassed to be acting in this film, but I suppose the massive paychecks help compensate for the blushing. Part of the problem, no doubt, is that I've never had much invested in comic book worlds, and the logical holes in this plot from a nonfiction point of view make it look like Swiss cheese. Does anyone involved in this production understand the problems of invoking teleology in nature? I suspect that everyone was too busy going to theater arts classes that they couldn't find time for \"boring\" science ones. I'm also a bit amazed at the level of violence that just seems ordinary in modern movies even aimed at children, which I strongly suspect is both a product and a cause what appears to be a simultaneous significant upswing in actual violence in the world's developed nations. There really might be other ways to settle disputes and problems other than with \"magic\" stones. Hasn't this kind of \"magic\" stone thing been done to death at this point? So the whole film is basically ridiculous but insists on the pretense of making some \"real\" insights into life by way of fiction. (I realize that this is going to be an unpopular review, but this film is 2 1/2 hours long and it's got the mental nutritional value of Cheez Whiz.) There's simply no \"there\" \"there. On the other hand, I can't help but be amazed at the special effects. This movie is like an exceptionally high-quality amusement park ride which stirs your emotions strongly at times, but is still essentially meaningless. It's like vicarious BASE jumping. I'm still glad I saw it, since I now know what everyone else is talking about; however, it didn't leave me better off in any way whatsoever otherwise after watching it. To all the fanboys out there, I apologize for being such a \"Debbie Downer\".", "This movie is literally the best movie out there.I was completely amazed and the russo brothers pulled off the greatest achievement of all time.This is history and will forever be.", "Definitely the best Avengers movie. Fighting scenes in Wakanda are amazing,especially when Thor enters.", "A decade after the debut of 'Iron Man', Marvel finally reaches its peak, concluding three phases that brought the great heroes of Casa das Ideias to the screen, who knew how to make the necessary adaptations while maintaining the essence of the original material of the comics. In this decade of huge successes, the audience became intimate with Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Ant-Man, Thor, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, in short, the whole range of characters that today make part of everyone's life. And there are characters to come before the end of phase 3 in 'Ultimatum'. The cinema knew how to popularize and expand exponentially all these characters already so familiar to fans of comics. With each new phase, new characters and universes are added to this formula, consequently leaving everything bigger, better and grander. With the contracts about to expire and having to increasingly pay stratospheric salaries to their stars, it is natural that this phase closure is the end of the cycle for some, while other characters will continue to emerge for years to come. To command this last film, which will be divided into two parts, the Russo brothers were called, who directed highly praised films by Captain America, The Winter Soldier and Civil War, which is also an Avengers for having brought together several Super heroes. For the script, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were called again, who had the complex mission of bringing together earthly and cosmic characters in an organic and convincing way, placing the heroes in the face of a devastating threat. In Avengers, Infinity War, Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally arrives on Earth, willing to collect the Infinity Stones. To face it, the Avengers need to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while dealing with disagreements among some of their members. One of the points that we observe here is how the connection between the different films of the Marvel universe is made with extreme mastery. All loose ends are tied and we can see the consequences of the events of previous films, since the split of the heroes in 'Civil War' (after the events we noticed that Tony Stark and Steven Rogers had broken off since then), Bucky Barnes' exile (Sebastian Stan) in Wakanda and how the heroes have followed separate paths since then. Captain America (Chris Evans), the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) went to one side as fugitives, the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) started a relationship, the Hulk had stayed the recent years in another galaxy, as seen in 'Thor, Ragnarok', the Guardians of the Galaxy continued their space adventures, now with Mantis (Pom Klementieff - featured in 'Guardians 2') integrated once and for all with Peter Quill ( Chris Pratt) having, finally, relating with Gamora (Zoe Saldana). We see Spider-Man (Tom Holland) continuing his student life with his newfound powers joining in the cosmic battle with the group, officially becoming an Avenger. We also see characters from the Black Panther universe, presented a few months before to the public, with Wakanda being the stage of an extensive and important sequence. 'Infinite War', like the infinite itself, has no beginning and no end, starting in the midst of the action directly connected with Thor, Ragnarok in which we have an exact notion of the size of the threat faced. If in small appearances in previous films, Thanos failed to show everything he was capable of, here he arrives showing what he came for. In ten minutes of film, the Titan beats Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) mercilessly and without mercy, decimates Asgardians and ends Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) without making the slightest effort. This is the point at which, we buy the seriousness of the situation and the grandeur and seriousness of the villain. From there, as never before, the universe is fully explored as we follow the villain in search of the Jewels of Infinity across the galaxy. Thor's encounter with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the split of the group in two, with Thor, Rocket and the teenager Groot going to Nidavellir, where Eitri, the dwarf (Peter Dinklage) would manage to make a new hammer for Thor, with which he he could defeat Thanos and the others by going to Knowhere, where The Collector (Ben\u00edcio Del Toro) keeps the Jewel of Reality. Having already had the Jewel of Power, obtained when Thanos wiped out Xandar, he would become even stronger. Meanwhile, the other heroes stay on Earth to face Thanos' allies, who desperately try to obtain the Jewels of Time (which is protected by Doctor Strange) and Mind (which is part of the Vision). This beginning of the conclusion of phase 3 of the Marvel universe expands the action to several places on Earth (New York - where Thanos' followers go after the Jewel that is with Doctor Strange, Scotland and Wakanda - to obtain the Jewel of the Mind). In addition, in space we travel to Gamora's home planet wiped out by Thanos, to Knowhere - where The Collector, Titan lives - Thanos' planet, Vormir - where the Soul Jewel was, where only Gamora knew her whereabouts, Nidavellir - dwarf planet forging the most deadly weapons in the galaxy. In 'Infinite War', we have the feeling that there is really a powerful and practically unbeatable threat that puts humanity and the entire galaxy at risk, to the point of being wiped out in a snap. The film carries an air of despair and hopelessness. What we see on the screen are characters fighting side by side and trying to improvise in the face of a threat far greater than the sum of their powers. The battle still carries the airs of altruism and strength of the previous films, but this time, we have moved far from that feeling that everything is under control and will be resolved in some heroic and inventive way. The writers rightly chose to leave the villainous titan Thanos at the center of the story. The film carried by the antagonist's unexpected charisma, which has contextualized motivations, and fits perfectly into the presented universe - he is cruel, merciful, has a sense of humor and is kind. Here, his relationship with his \"adopted daughters\" can finally be properly explored. In this respect, many applause for Josh Brolin's performance combined with the incredible visual effects that created the figure of the Crazy Titan With an established enemy, the directors' competence shown in 'Civil War' in reconciling so many heroes on the scene, is repeated here, on a much larger scale. With so many heroes on the scene, it was possible to notice even more the relationship between them. Thor's dynamic with the Guardians of the Galaxy is excellent, especially with Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). We even have some scenes of the God of Thunder with his half brother Loki, who once again reinforces the love-hate relationship between the brothers. We also have the hilarious relationship between Spider-Man and Iron Man, again repeating the partnership in some hilarious scenes. The duo still has great chemistry with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Captain America's team also had a fearless resistance with the Royal Guard, the Frontier Tribe, the Dora Milaje and the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Whether across the galaxy or on Earth, the groups formed to defend humanity from Thanos' imposing threat. The whole cast is great and the excitement of each one to be part of these experiences is notorious. Contrary to what we saw in the past, by the way, you can say that Infinite War is the darkest film in the Marvel shared universe. This is not only due to the aforementioned sense of hopelessness, the result of the notion that, at that time, the heroes really are dealing with a threat far greater than the strength of their powers, but also because of the decrease in the tone of jokes and comic reliefs. . Not only the public, but the heroes themselves know that what they face now is far greater than any enemy they have faced before. There are no words to describe the magnificent visual effects, which are further magnified on the big screen of the cinema. The action scenes on practically all planets and scenarios bring out the best to be explored in each situation. The joining of so many worlds, in so many contexts and how everything is so integrated was certainly an arduous task, but performed to perfection. The varied photography of Trent Opaloch combined with the production designer of Charles Wood and the soundtrack of Alan Silvestri places the viewer in the most diverse environments and brings all the dramatic and spectacular load to the viewer. It is the feeling of integration of the entire Marvel universe materializing in a way that it is impossible not to please the public. Infinite War is not just a film, it is a cinematic event, one of those films that are practically unanimous and that manage to go down in history, due to the quality, repercussions and records achieved successively. More than an adventure or action film, like most of its predecessors, the film has a much greater sense of urgency. The Russo brothers made a megalomaniac work, with unforgettable scenes of action (with special emphasis on the action scenes that take place in Titan and Wakanda) and with dilemmas of friendship and family that are fully supported. This is the long-awaited show since 'The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King (2003)', something so spectacular and well built at the same time.", "I don't understand the appeal of these superhero movies at all. They're so dumb & melodramatic, why not just watch WWE or soap operas? I prefer cartoons. Thanos seemed like an interesting villain but he's not. I never wanted the bad guy to win so bad, all these \"heroes\" are just annoying.", "Don't get me wrong. The movie is great and all, but is it just me that nobody cares about any of the genocide that has happened in the world and is still happening today, but as soon as it happens a movie it's the greatest thing since sliced bread? Pretty pathetic excuse for a human race we are to say genocide in a movie is wrong but still let it happen in real life. Do we get to see all of the murdered native americans return to life as well or just all the white people who died in the movie?", "This film is pretty good and shoking\nAnd itis best avengers movie", "This movie is a bit longer than 2 hours, it took me about 4 hours to finish it. Why? Because I paused frequently. To check this, to do that. Basically, I was bored. It was too jumbled, too many heroes in the same room. First half in: way too many jokes. I swear I was expecting someone to fart at some point.  all the others looked pretty worn out and tired as I felt at the end of this movie. Not many sparks. Mostly CGI and fan fiction. And dramatic music, pretty much non-stop. No soul. No soul is the death of love.", "This movie was really great,Better pacing and a great villain. Perfect standalone movie and highly enjoyable even for a casual fan. I loved it.", "Well, it is a good movie. It is spectacular and it is probably the best conclussion we could get for the plot arc that has been this phase of the MCU. I went out of the cinema thinking \"between 7.5 and 8\", but after a night sleep, i put a 7 on it. It does not deserve to be in the over 8 score movies like Interstellar for instance. Keep the feelings where they belong and consider that avengers endgame:\n It's not innovative, it's a wonderful mass media product, glorious to see and enjoy, but... nothing more. A wonderful empty bag. 7 goes because i give 5 to movies that actually bring conclussion, 1 point because music was spot on and 1 point because I was very entertained for 3 hours. PS: while the fall of Ironman was somewhat emotional for me, the moment where Black Widow sacrifices itself did not cause any feeling besides boredom to me.", "This review is in response to clearly faked bots posting fake 10 star reviews\nAhaha, this film is nonsense of the highest order.\nHulk is too scared to fight? Or they can't bothered writing about him?\nThey'll keep making this crap if you disagree with me. Fandom disease spreads like wildfire", "This movie got me full chub. I was rock hard the whole time. Thank you marvel.", "From the stylish cinematography to the stunning visual effects this movie has it all. Once again Robert Downey JR gives a confident performance as he leads the avengers into a breathtaking battle. The ensemble cast has the performance of there life time as the likes of Tom Holland and Benedict Cumberbatch amaze the audience. The avengers has officially revolutionised modern cinema as we know it.", "The movie, Avengers: Infinity War, is one of the greatest Marvel movies ever made.\nThe movie consisted of tons of action, perspective changes and plot twists. The movie also had a lot of Marvel superheroes. Secondly, there was 10 years and 18 movies building up to this movie. Lastly, Infinity Wars made a grand total of 2.048 billion dollars. I think we can all agree that a movie with plot twists and a lot of action can be extremely good. These additions can not only make the movie more enjoyable, but they also help contribute to the amount of movie it makes. Let's look at the 2.048 billion dollars Infinity Wars made.Movies are filled with different elements. Plot twists, perspective changes, action, they all contribute to making the movie a great film.Infinity Wars consists of all these attributes, and more. Also, a movie that has had 18 other Marvel movies building up to it, it's bound to be good. Lastly, a movie that has made over 2 BILLION dollars is undeniably worth watching.", "Doesn't have to be underrated only because it's a unrealistix sci-fi super hero movie for kids (and adults as well). It's a good movie without prejudice. Hail Marvel, rip Stan Lee.", "Honestly one of the most entertaining movies ive ever watched in my life.", "Fairly bland plot considering that it is currently ranked as the 51th best film of all time on imdb. Not much character development but I guess that is what the sequals are for. The consequence of that is that the film really feels like another filler movie to cash out more on the Marvel universe. Hence the ending of the film of course. Avengers infinity war does some good like showing different sides of the antagonist, explaining his motives and the reasoning behind them (unlike that stupid villain in Justice League), and making him do challenging decisions. I also liked the dialouge between the superheroes, especially the Guardians of the galaxy crew and Thor. Their scenes were really funny and I like the fact that humor is a central part between these characters, it makes the movie stick out from other typical superhero action movies, and it shows that it doesn't take itself so seriosuly. Those were some original points that stood out to me and made me not rate it a 3/10.", "Honestly, this is just so fun to watch! Exciting, And truly a great way to tie it all up from all previous marvel movies!\nThere people that are like, \"it's dumb how this relies on the other movies\" or how you have to know the other movies to whatch this. That gets me mad for this whole Marvel Cenamatic Universe is not just separate movies but a whole series just like Harry Potter or other book series and movie serious. Just as if you were to read the last book in a series, it won't make sense, where this is will be the same thing, it won't make sense, they've been building up to this movie and the next for over 10 years! So for people to say that you need to rely on the other movies to understand or jokes that refer to other movies, then you have no right to say this is a good or bad movie, because you don't know anything about the series! In the end, they did a Fantasic job making the infinity war and is a truly great movie that brings the comic book characters to life in a all out fight against Thanos and his army! But it ain't over yet. Not to mention that they made Thanos really well in strength and look and not phoney, cannot wait for the next one witch I totally believe will be amazing in every way as our comic superhero's continue to fight for the universe.", "Thor Stabs Thanos with Stormbreaker and Thanos says, \"you should have gone for the head. \" and snaps NOW HALF THE UNIVERSE IS GONE INCLUDING FAVORITE HEROES", "The IMDB rating of 8.6 / 10 is undeserved, most of the 10-starers mention the 18 movies coming before it. It's like reviewing a TV series episode based on every other episode, it's misleading. This means, the MCU is 8.6 / 10 but infinity war is closer to a 6-7. Pros: Great if you want action. Thanos is a great villain, intimidating, great backstory, motivation, it's all there. There are mysteries for you to solve, it may be well written, but the movie is so long with so much miscellanious stuff that it becomes impossible to realize. All your favorite characters are there. I don't have much more to say. Cons: Because this acts as a TV show episode, because the \"TV show\" is the MCU, we have to sit here with 1-dimensional characters(thanos's minions especially, as they were never introduced in the MCU), a plot which might be possible to come up with as you go along(doesn't mean there isn't one) and inconsistant characters(hulk is scared, but i don't have a problem with that, thor can't use lightning without his weapon like in thor: ragnarok, scarlet witch gets beaten by a black order member, then holds of thanos with 4 stones). I understand thanos may be hesitating because guardians of the galaxy establishes the power of the infinity stones(atleast 1 of them). But even then a simple black order member wouldn't be more effective than 4 stones. The 2-part thing is going to be another stereotypical superhero thing, heroes win. Even in a movie about action it is possible to get bored, my family had to watch this in segments. When thanos snaps his fingers, the last infinity stone he gets is the mind stone(vision's head) and the fact that there is no evidence that the MCU between 2018-2019 become affected by it, despite thanos saying it's supposed to occur randomly. Characters are affected, even if sequels are planned for them(spiderman, doctor strange, black panther). But i doubt that any new character they add to avengers 4 will talk about the snapping fingers emotional effects on them. If you don't want a potential plot for avengers 4, don't look beyond this wall.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAvengers 4 will be more predictable than this to me:\nThanos tries to control the avengers, someone snaps them out of it.\nPrepare to face thanos(unless they already have).\nBangs and booms(potentially more travel).\nFinal battle ends with removal of gautlet.\nReverse snapping fingers(gamora and heimdall R.I.P)", "Impressed how marvel cinematic universe is rising and converging at one point. Cant wait for the next part.", "This holds up incredibly well upon a rewatch. Now I can safely say that this IS my favorite MCU film and nothing can change my mind (before Avengers 4 arrives, of course). It's not perfect, but who expected that. The fact that they pulled this off and made it one of the greatest comic book movies ever, is an achievement worthy of an Oscar. Okay its pacing is a bit unstable at times, and sometimes no gap to breath even a little is left between funny and dramatic moments. That's why I actually would have liked this to be even longer. But I don't care because the rest of it kicks ass anyway. It fixes almost all the major gripes I've had with some of the previous Marvel movies. Generic and bland music? Alan Silvestri's soundtrack is a killer. Pretty unremarkable visuals? Seeing it in a theatre was some of the most stunning ones I've attended (sure it's not Blade Runner 2049, but no other film can look that good). It has landscapes and locations that left me astounded. CGI was 95% of the time top-notch. ALL of the actors in this possibly the biggest movie cast ever do fantastic job. And the villain? The villain was the best thing in the movie. He sees himself as a hero of his own story, and you kind of get why he does what he does. His plan is obviously wrong and flawed, but that's why he is the villain. Thanos does appear as a sort of protagonist in Infinity War, it starts with him and ends with him. It's his story. Some describe Avengers 3 as a half of a movie, but it's not quite true. In Thanos' point of view it tells a whole story. In heroes' point of view, sure it's a cliffhanger and Avengers 4 is on its way. Because of the solid work done for this universe this does not need to flesh out characters as we already know them. Nevertheless, this is still filled with character moments that deepens them even more. Almost all the time it was a perfect blend of dark and light even though it's mostly dark. And the ending, oh gosh the ending. Before you start whinging me how it was a cheap gimmick, let me tell you something, it doesn't freaking matter. They had balls to end it this way, they left us hanging for a whole year. And I know Avengers 4 will somehow surprise us (again), because Kevin Feige has shown love and commitment for this whole universe and he won't let us down. This managed to be both surprising and satisfying at the same time. I really think it was the film Star Wars: The Last Jedi should have been (not saying that Last Jedi is bad). All hail Lord Feige! Avengers: Infinity War is one hell of an experience filled with moments I will never forget, worth the 10 years in the making, and if you 10 years ago told this little kid, that this kind of movie will exist in the future, I probably would think you as a kind of crazy person. It's an achievement that this was made to happen, it will leave it's mark in film history at some form, you just have to accept it.", "No storytelling, just action. I don't understand the last scene.", "This movie is beyond awesome, and I call it awesome not just because I have to, as so many people have liked and given crazy 10 ratings. I genuinely feel it is. I think the Russo brothers have done a commendable job in bringing so many superheroes in one film and Indeed it must have been crazy. One wrong move and it could just go wrong. Remember how Spiderman 3 and The Amazing Spiderman 2 went wrong in the similar manner. The directors just couldn't work with the idea of using multiple villians in the script. Thankfully that does not happen here. There are many superheroes and many supervillians and works just fine. Credit should go to screenwriters because the main job is always handled by them. The biggest strength of this film is that you don't have to watch the previous MCU movies to understand the storyline. urrmm..ok you must watch some movies but not entirely because I haven't seen myself. And it was one of the reasons why I was a bit doubtful whether I would like the film or not as I am having the lack of knowledge. But the makers have pulled off a superb job. The film is so gripping from start to finale you won't even care what happened previously. Every character is well defined and moves you. Heck! didn't even watch the two galaxy movies before this film but still could understand everything. That's the magic this film got. People hating on the ending especially on Quill's part is childish and annoying. Quill loved Gamora to the extent that he could not lose her. His action was understandable and inevitable. Ditto for the part of Thanos, He had to be victorious, and its fine considering the next movie is coming next year (fingers crossed) Coming to performances, everyone has given their best foot forward. But I have my favourites. Josh Brolin as Thanos dominates the show with a commanding presence and engaging act while the best performance comes from Zoe Saldana as Gamora, She moves you completely and takes this film to an time high, kudos to the makers who thought of giving her such a strong arc this time. The next day I watched Both guardian movies and her performance in those films were nothing to write home about. So yeah ! Gamora rules Next comes Okoye, she was simply fantastic as the General of The Wakanda Army. Her role is quite short but she manages to make a mark ditto for Nebula who is striking in a small role. Emotionally distraught, she is ready to take on her evil step father even if it means her death. Last Comes Black Widow who sadly didn't get much to do not even proper fight scenes she is known for. But her presence is enough to ensure light. Rest all were great. I wouldn't call this one a masterpiece but its certainly a great piece of cinema. Go Watch it !", "The production and direction unit very easily justifies all the marvel characters in this movie. The movie proves that a story of multiple and unavoidable characters can be told and visualized in mere 160 Minutes. KUDOS!!!\nThe balance of characters and events are done with great precision and timing.\nSadly, I never get to see HULK in his SMASH mode. Hope the next/Final part will have hulk in full SMASH mode kicking Thanos!!!", "It's not often I write reviews but I had to for this unbelievable masterpiece.\nIt had me riveted from start to finish and made me forget all of the troubles I currently have in my life. I couldnt wait to see all the amazing characters one by one and for the next bit of amazing action, one after another and so relentless. \nI get bored very easily so when something can keep me so mesmerised for so long it has to be good.\nMy only complaint is that I have to wait far too long to find out what happens. \nThis is by far the best super hero film ever made and for me one of the best films I've ever seen. I'd give it 20 out of 10 if I could.\nFantastic. \nIt makes the DC films (which I like) (I'm a big superman fan) look like cheap made for TV rubbish.", "Acting was great but overall, a huge disappointment!! This movie might as well been a freaking soap opera. I had high expectations but feel like I wasted time watching this. Usually superhero flicks are action packed, but this....not so much.", "Infinity war is based on 2 things first thanos & start conclusion of 1st avengers in these movie perfectly time space for all characters", "My god this movie is dull. Not bad, not good, just...dull. Plain. Passing gra-ok, point made. So what can I say? The film that was built up as the ultimate celebration and culmination of everything Marvel turned out to be an unfocused, bloated mess (no joke, the climax of the movie goes on for nearly 45 minutes) that's actually just an advertisement for the next movie, where every character that died will be unceremoniously revived (a time-honored comic book tradition) and the MCU will become even bigger and more confusing. The best thing I can say is that if you're looking for an acceptable popcorn flick with enough jokes and cool moments to distract you from the 150-minute running time and terrible villain, this is for you. But if you want a well-written film with interesting characters, a tight well-paced narrative and great directing and cinematography...look elsewhere. Infinity War proves once and for all that comic book movie universes are to nerds what the Fast and the Furious is to ****heads: a bland, soulless corporate cashgrab that will be completely forgotten about in a decade or so. And if you don't believe me, I have a copy of House of Dracula for you.", "I'm a Marvel fan and a fan of most of the franchise movies (except Black Panther). I was looking forward to a cinematic adaptation of epic Infinity Stones saga. Sadly I was rather disappointed. Here is why for the most part (I'm not picky): 1. Bad adaptation. \nTransition from comics to movies is not easy. Lack of Mistress Death makes Thanos character very shallow and to be honest dumb. I just kill 50% of beings in the Universe because of overpopulation? That is a very idiotic reasoning and undermines the whole movie. It's as if writers were afraid the movie will become to much of a fairy tale and ppl who are not comic fans wont like it. Why not film a few scenes with Mistress Death and make the audience wonder if she's real or just in Thanos' head (suggest psychic illness?). I'd buy an explanation that he is a mad man dreaming of pleasing Death itself by killing half of the Universe than a sane man who does it because of overpopulation... The fear of overpopulation is a really outdated way of thinking about reasons our civilization collapses and just not true anymore. In developed countries low birth rates are the problem so stop pushing the overpopulation nonsense in scifi and update yourself Hollywood. \n2. Generic CGI army\n-does nothing for me. It's just bad and doesn't bring anything to the movie. I just want to skip it. Use the time for more story development or just safe money. It didn't work in Star Wars it will NEVER work in that CGI format (kudos to GOT for doing battle of bastards right). \n3. To much Iron man, meaningless fights\n-I know he's popular but he wont overcome Thanos with a few sidekicks. Intelligent people are suppose to be able to do some planning. Here we're serveed just some stupid fighting scenes that lead to nothing.\n4. Star Lord loosing he's temper and in consequence freeing Thanos seconds before he looses the gauntlet is a very very low B-class movies move. Cut it out. \n5. Time stone\nI'm kinda confused why Dr Strange gives away the stone. Maybe he saw that it's supposed to happen in the 1 of millions futures he skipped trough but still it somehow seems stupid. Why is fighting Thanos at all in that case?  Overall I want to love it but it's kinda hard. Still 5-6/10 but this movie could have been much better.", "Amazing movie from start to finish, love every moment, to see our hero's struggle against Thanos, and a movie been long awaited and didn't disappoint, defiantly in my opinion best Marvel movie.", "This movie is far better than Justice league. This Movie's storyline was awesome and the characters deaths were so emotional. I hope they return in Avengers 4", "Where do i start with this? Well, if you have not seen this already, youv'e been warned. First off, the costume design is amazing! Just look how shiny Spider-Man's suit is. And the amount of shock in this movie, its ridiculous. The theories were right about Red Skull being teleported into another planet. And the battle in Wakanda, wow. The Avengers then fail to stop Thanos from gathering all of the Infinity stones. Then comes the most heartbreaking scene, where half of all existance is ripped in two. I was in total shock when half of the Avengers fate lead to doom. The feeling that the heroes genuinely failed leaves a hole in your heart. The only problem with the movie is screen time. Not all Avengers had that much screen time, like Black Widow or Black panther. But otherwise, this movie is a masterpeice.", "Writers, producers, and directors simply suck today. They mask their massive incompetence with a plethora of special effects. It is hard to ruin a movie filled with characters who all bring a massive, built-in audience. Yet they managed to do so. They turned the Hulk into a joke. The Hulk!!! One of the most beloved and sympathetic characters in Marvel. I was waiting for the Hulk to have round two. It never came. Moreover, I don't understand how so soon after Thor's people are mass murdered right in front of him, he starts cracking jokes within minutes of being rescued by the GG. Why do writers today feel the need to turn dramatic scenes into a Friends sitcom? The only thing missing from this movie was a laugh track. I fail to see the comedy in an all powerful being brutally mass murdering from credits to credits. This could have been a powerful and more dramatic film. Yet writers never fail to inject jokes at the most inappropriate times, which distracts from the movie. Thor cracking one-liners right after what was left of the Asgard race has been annihilated made absolutely no sense to me. Portraying the Hulk as Abbot and Costello throughout the entire film also makes no sense. Another irksome thread in this film was the weakness of the Vision. Vision is as powerful as they come yet they basically made him a symbol for First Alert \"I've fallen and I can't get up\" from credits to credits. In the comic books Vision is no joke. In this film, he is the weakest Avenger of them all. In my opinion today's society prefers to portray women as powerful, and men as weak buffoons. I have no problem with a powerful woman. I do have a problem with the weakening of men in the process. Both can be and should be powerful. Additionally, this movie is all over the place and never brings the Avengers together as one cohesive team. They are basically scattered across the cosmos each small group doing their own thing completely oblivious to what is going on with the other members. Its similar to how they ruined the Transformers over time. How do you manage to ruin a franchise that has a built-in audience? Unlike most other movies the audience for the Avengers and the Transformers existed for years, if not decades before the movies were made. How do you blow it? Simple, try to squeeze three movies into one by jumping around all over the place. Also, toss in an abundance of jokes that only serve to ruin dramatic scenes because you think the audience needs to laugh every five minutes. If all you care about is death, destruction, special effects, and jokes you will love this movie. I rank this ridiculous film up there with Freddy versus Jason. If you seek a thrilling story filled with heart ache, triumph, and characters that really draw you in, this movie sucks. I gave it some stars due to my love of Marvel. I am glad I waited to rent this movie or I'd really be upset.", "Considering the fact that this is a SUPERHERO movie, it has the first ending that, actually makes a lot of sense. I don't understand what this movie was missing or what it had too much of to give it such bad ratings from the fans - some being HUGE marvel fans, yet hated the movie (Like one of my friends). All the ratings are 10s or 9s or 1s or 2s. C'mon, my marvel-fan friends, encourage the damn film so that Avengers 4 will be the best amongst all the films! Let's make the next movie worth an 11!!!", "RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems. The story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch. This is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one. \"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\" THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. GRADE: B-", "SPOILERS: Justified expectation of the fan MARVEL\nI decided to make my review of the third part of the Avengers. Immediately I can say that I'm doing reviews for the first time. So, I like watching movies MARVEL, and I was happy to wait for this part, like everyone else, because it was the fate of the car-kicking MARVEL. But in a year there will be \"Avengers 4\", but the third part did what other films MARVEL could not. And this is the death of the main characters to the clicks of Thanos. I was very surprised. I can tell only the pros and cons of this film: Pluses: * Thank you for long-wating DEATH Loki! ... Unexpected twists and turns, like the mysterious location of the last Infinity stone - the Soul stone, well-designed special effects and graphics, a huge number of MARVEL heroes and of course Thanos. The Rousseau brothers made a real villain of Thanos with normal motivation. This bastard is ready for anything for the sake of stones and will not stop at nothing. We can hate it somewhere in moments, understand it and empathize with it. I believe that Josh Brolin perfectly got used to this character. The main female characters are as always ideal and good, an excellent soundtrack, action scenes and good humor in some moments. Minuses: Unjust ending, stupid actions of the main characters, more that some characters forgot their abilities, or at the right time they did not use them at the first opportunity. Also, I did not like the fact that Falcon's eyes were not shown with the Ant-Man. Although we were told that they would appear in this film. Too much pathos and prolonged dialogue. Conclusion: Despite the shoals of the film, he may like everyone, even those who begin to get acquainted with the films about superheroes. But I strongly recommend that you first look at all 18 movies of the movie-market MARVEL before watching the third Avengers. And also it's a pity that the competitors of DC can not withdraw their kinomiks, which will surpass the War of Infinity. Although the DC comes out Aquaman and Shazam, but still they can not surpass this masterpiece. Still very happy for the fact that this film Joss Weedon did not shoot, but he could turn into an unfriendly comedy. * 11 out of 10", "Avengers: Infinity War is a very well-made film. Every piece is combined brilliantly to create a stunning spectacle. Throughout the film I was glued to the screen and frozen in my seat. There are so many shocking, intense and even humorous moments. It is truly amazing to see 10 years of hard work all combine to achieve a tremendous result.  A film of this size and grandeur always had a huge task in terms of assembly, but the editing and pacing of the film is highly commendable. The film had so much to live up to and as a devoted Marvel fan I can tell you that it does not disappoint. A big reason behind the film's success is down to the Russo brothers who have now cemented their careers as cinema legends.\n \nThe special effects in Infinity War are some of the best I have ever seen: the character Thanos looks positively menacing! To describe the film as a visual spectacle is an understatement. It is clear that a lot of hard work went into every frame of the film and it really pays off.  There are so many larger than life characters in the film and seeing all of them united is a dream come true. I must admit I was sceptical when I first heard that all the characters were appearing together, but after viewing the finished product I can only salute the makers of the film. \nThe acting in the film is compelling and I really liked the storylines of all the heroes. However, I was not expecting to appreciate the storyline of Thanos as must as I did. Thanos is an awesome villain and I think that this is down to the filmmakers taking the time to carefully craft an interesting history and aura to the character which is brought to life by Josh Brolin who does a fantastic job.  Overall, I would highly recommend Avengers: Infinity War. It is a great instalment to the Marvel franchise and I am excited to see how the film series concludes.", "Where should I start? Geez what a spectacular movie considering that the amount of characters are in it.how did the russos do it? Fun, exciting,emotional and just fun!", "The movie is the best MCU movie i have ever watched. I mean there were times in the movie that were a little long driven but that doesn't matter because the movie was just so good.", "The way it ended left so many different plots for the next movie and new characters that are in the Comics.", "I saw Avengers Infinity War 4 times with my friends I loved it, it is one of my favourite film of this year and it is now one of my favourite films of all time. I kept away from any spoilers before seeing the movie, I also avoided watching adds and trailers. It absolutely surprised me and I'm glad I have seen it.", "First off, I want to state that I am a massive fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have watched and loved every movie in the franchise, with the exceptions of Thor: The Dark World and The Incredible Hulk. I still liked them, but I didn't love them as much as the others. Now, I will admit that I had my doubts heading into this movie. An event of this magnitude has never been attempted before this and I was worried that The Russo Brothers might not have been able to juggle the amount of characters and storylines that had been established up to this point. In the first ten minutes, those worries were put to rest. This movie is an incredible experience and you owe it to yourself to feel the same way every other person who has seen this movie has felt. You'll find yourself laughing, crying, throwing your fist into the air in excitement and then speechless by the end. Josh Brolin gives an incredible performance as Thanos. Somehow, someway, despite him threatening to wipe out half of all life in the universe, you find yourself feeling for him as he has to make sacrifices that he knows have to be made for the greater good. Every character we have come to know and love gets their time in the spotlight, even if it's just for a moment. The action in the movie is incredible and despite what some may say, every single joke lands. It doesn't slow down for a moment and by the end you'll be wishing for more. Even a month after seeing the film, I have still yet to completely gather my thoughts. What I want to say is that this movie is a worthy culmination of ten years of hard work from Marvel. It is an experience that may never be replicated and I feel proud to have called myself a Marvel fan for many years.", "At first we were not sure what to expect. Watching this cinematic Master Piece in Hollywood inside the El Capitan Entertainment Centre is quite nice, especially with the Organ tunes at the beginning. We were able to check out the costumes of the cast & the Guardians of the Galaxy b4 the screening. \n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is a thrill & fun ride, featuring an \"All Star Cast\" including a certain Raccoon or Wiesel.\nThe effects are stellar, atmosphere during the Screening like a green light, ready to go. \nWe highly recommend this labor of love. Only suggestion, please add the Pink Panther next time, in order to keep the Black Panther company.", "So much to say about this film! So many things happened! Tom Holland hit me with the feels, love the new spidey suit! Can tell peter looks up to Tony, and the slight look on Tony's face when peter turns to dust is heartbreaking! Loki don't know how many times he's died so i hope they do something about bringing him back to life! Thor is legit THE GOD! Gamora well she deserved better! Loving teenage groot! Overall fantastic film, looking forward to the next films such as captain marvel! I would give it a 10 but the ending almost gave me a heart attack and now it's a waiting game for the next film!", "Ignore the people giving this low scores, this is an amazing movie and clearly they are bitter and trying to bring down the ratings or something. The way they bring together so many characters in one movie is amazingly well done & it works. There are almost no boring parts in the movie. What surprised me most is that although I hated things Thanos did he's not simply pure evil, he's doing it out of a sense of achieving a greater good. His regret during certain actions makes me feel differently about him then other typical bad guys. I've seen it 4 times and it's enjoyable each time, I definitely look forward to owning it! Now one of my all time favourite movies. I typically don't believe in a perfect movie but this one comes as close as I've ever seen.", "A majestic cinematic experience building on 10 years of MCU storytelling, Infinity War has everything a movie buff could ask for; heartfelt drama, comedy, passion, and startling intensity. This is an absolute must-see film that undoubtedly will influence another generation of filmmakers, and will leave everyone on the edge of their seat after watching it. It's one of the rarified movies one can sit and watch over and over again. 10 stars for 2+ hours of cinematic bliss.", "I was waiting this movie from a long time and enjoyed too but movie ended with suspense and it was quite heart breaking for me.... lol", "The movie was great. The CGI was beutiful, and the story was even better. Say what you want about the movie but Thanos was great. The Lavender Low-Life is one of the best, if not the best villian is the entire super hero movie genre to date. The only other one that comes close is Loki. The fight scenes are epic. I especially liked Thor and Dr. Strange in them. I guess it was mostly just the special effects, but they looked awesome fighting Thanos and his minions. \n There are also some cool non-fighting scenes, like the one from the trailer with Thor and the Guardians. I really like the relationship between Iron Man and Spider-Man. Tom Holland's performance was amazing.\n Overall, 10/10 would watch again.", "I will start by saying this is the best marvel film to date, and arguably the best superhero film to date, on par with The Dark Knight. The villain Thanos is an absolute beast, and the best villain the MCU has ever seen, hell he is just one step lower than Joker.  Yes, it is exactly what you would expect from a superhero movie,over the top action scenes, stunning visuals and scenery with the added quality that MCU has been consistently giving us in the last few movies. Great humor, great acting, and some emotions here and there. To all those who rated this movie less than 5/10, i feel sorry for you DC fanboys, but your 1/10 useless reviews are not convincing anybody but other DC fanboys. Congratulations on 2billion MCU, you managed to outdo yourselves once again and set the bar to incredible heights. My only concern right now is that part2 will not be as good because this was incredible!", "This movie was a great addition to the MCU. I am a little disappointed there was very little Hulk in the movie. To see half of Earth's mightiest Heroes fall was great. The action scenes (especially on Wakanda) were well choreographed. We see a whole new side of Star Lord. It was great.", "'Avengers: Infinity War' undoubtedly lives up to its hype; it is a brilliant milestone for not only Marvel Studios but for superhero films in general.\nThere's a simple quote in this film from the character of Doctor Strange, who says that out of out of the 14,000,605 alternate ways to try and defeat Thanos (the villain), it was only in one of them that the Avengers won. This can easily be related to the production of the film; there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong and I think they just got it right. There were obviously a few minor flaws, like any film, but overall this was a masterpiece for mainstream cinema.\nThe film was able to give the vast amount of characters a satisfying amount of screen time that did justice to almost every all of them. For me, personally, the character highlights were Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Thor, and Gamora; every scene these characters were in were the most entertaining for me and I believe these characters got the best storylines and plot developments. The only criticism I would have is what the film decided to do with the character of Hulk; it essentially wasted the character and didn't come across as funny. I'd even go far enough to question Mark Ruffalo's performance in this, as it came across as careless and rather lazy.\nThankfully, the film didn't get dull at any point, despite it's lengthy screen time. If there wasn't a gripping action scene, it was a smartly written interaction between our well-loved superheroes, full of witty banter and hilarious one-liners. Star-Lord was certainly the funniest character, with props to Chris Pratt for delivering the humor effortlessly.\nHowever, the humor was served as a relief, from the brooding and dark tone that sits over every scene, in which you can't shake the feeling that something terrible is going to happen. The entirety of this film was highly anticipated, being led up to by 18 previous films, so it's fair to assume something significant is going to happen. And it certainly does. The climax of this film is shocking, brutal and emotional in all the best ways. I used to criticise superhero films, claiming that they're so predictable as the heroes always defeat the villain. Did this movie prove my statement wrong? Absolutely. The only thing is, is that it's obvious that the many \"deaths\" that appear at the end are obviously temporary, given Marvel's upcoming movies (such as Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Spider-Man 2 and 3).\nFurthermore, this film is a visual masterpiece. The awe-striking visual effects, cinematography, production and costume design make this film a visual delight; something a computer screen would not do justice. So for all of those waiting until this film comes out online, do yourself a favor and spare a $15 to go and see this on the big screen - it's definitely worth it.", "As opposed the the narrow minded bunch who can only screw off I rate this movie highly.\nNot the full ten - it would have to be perfect for that. But in one movie, they've brought the whole bunch of characters together and a few of them get slain. Great! As normally there's a work around so it's all better in the morning, but not here where they could have whimsically done so when there's a time travel option knocking around. They actually stay dead! And for me personally, they offloaded some of the characters I wasn't that keen on, so Quids-in! (Well - I'd like to have confirm Pepper Potts was on the list) Plot is long but held attention of me and 2 teenagers. Some nice touches of teenage Groot and look out for the sign in Scotland \"We Deep Fry Kebabs\" - Ha ha nice touch! It's got sad bits, comedy bits and action. It's a marvel movie. How here's the question ... I was pondering if this movie therefore has the highest body count of any ever done? Think about it .... half the universe? \nThat gotta be more than a 100 right?\nWe can add those 1/10 reviewers to the list too!", "To anyone who gave this film a 1 rating.... Justice League must obviously get a -10 enough said!!!!", "I really don't think there's much this film could've done better, except perhaps some better writing here and there, funnier jokes, and a bit of touching up on the CGI. I went into this movie thinking it was essentially serve as a third act to the entire MCU and I was right but it was also more than that. At it's core this film is about Thanos, he's given a lot of screen-time to the point where he's basically the main character. The way most superhero movies work is we spend a majority of the film with the hero and then in mostly unconnected scenes until the third act, we sometimes cut to the villain doing their thing. Infinity War reversed that and treats Thanos like the protagonist but certainty not the hero. This created an extremely interesting film that I thoroughly enjoyed both times I saw it at the cinema. The pacing was fantastic, the soundtrack was quite good, some of the cinematography was great, and some of the actors did some of their best work in this franchise yet, most notably Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, and Tom Holland.", "So this was a amazing film.. which has obviously played out to become a part one and hopefully a part two!! I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie and I was pleased that it wasn't exactly a happy ending where all the superheros won. Call me bad but a little cliff hanger is good sometimes.. it's realistic and I can't wait for whatever is coming next.", "Best movie yet\nThe first 2hr 30min movie that actually flew by due to its captivity", "While I am a fan of comics I never was of its cinematic counterpart because almost always movie producdion houses and directors were not brave enough to adapt the movies like they were in the comics or close nough, in fear of not capturing the attention of the normal movie going masses. These last 16 movies by marvel decided to take a brave step in the right direction and expand on the comic universe in order to adapt some of the amazing and complex story lines from the comics. All 16 movies prior infonity wars led to the Infinity gauntlet event and slowly built up the plot for it in the backround of each movie. And finally with Avangers: Infinity War one of the most iconic battles in the marvel universe was fantastically adapted on the big screen. Avengers: Infinity War is the best movie of its genre, and the best comic adaption along with The Watchmen. I urge every Comic fan to watch this movie and be absolutely blown away. It blew all my expectations trough the roof!", "Ok, I accept I haven't seen all of the previous movies from the characters featured in this film. Thankfully, I had seen Guardians of The Galaxy and their inclusion kept my interest. \nMassively CGI'd, taking it almost into cartoon territory, depth and story were sacrificed for effects.\nHaving said that, it was a good enough yarn. And how much did Vin Diesel get paid for saying \"I am Groot\"?", "I found it so fascinating, especially at the end of the film, that he was lonely in the face of the sunset, and you could feel the desolation of his heart, and the love of the universe.", "Ohdoyfogdlhflxlhxlhxlhxlhclhclhclhxlhxlhxlgxlhxlhxlhxlhclhxlhxhlclhxho", "Hi this best movie just watch don't ask everyone you know to watch it its the best", "Best movie of all time. Action packed awesome must watch!! Money don't matter", "Sort of a part time avengers/marvel fan, have my favourites and dislike some heroes... however this film changed my mind on everything! Comedy, action, tense and shock factor ending... one of the best films I've ever seen, bravo!", "Unfortunately it is clear that the compelling story that was told will be completely undone by some sort of rewind in the universe bringing back all dead people. The moment you realize this will be the case the movie loses all of its value and you stop caring what will happen from that point on making whole movie essentially obsolete. I wish they would stick with consequences so that I could take the movie seriously, but it is clear they will not. I feel really bad about that part because if it weren't for the above downside it was actually a good movie. Well planned story, a villain that is not one dimensional (a real problem in overwhelming majority of marvel movies) and beautiful execution. Only real downside movie had was the number of characters in the movie rendered most of those characters into extras. If we were to cut them out of the movie, or just replace them with generic extras instead nothing would have changed plot-wise. But aside from that there was no problems with the movie and it was beautiful. I just wish it wasn't just gonna be rewind and undone, but sadly it will.", "After watching this movie now for a second time, I have to conclude that it is definitely the best Marvel movie yet! It certainly was tricky for the directors and writers to include so many different characters from the MCU in the movie, yet they managed to do so brilliantly, cutting to different character plots at clever points to tell the story. What really makes the movie so superior is that Josh Brolin's Thanos is a deep, complex villain who you can't say is inherently evil because he realises there are finite resources within this universe although his method of genocide is clearly not the right way to go about things! But Thanos is definitely the greatest Marvel villain to date, especially given that unlike many other Marvel villains, we have seen him before in the Guardians movies and post-credits for both previous Avengers films. The performances by everyone in this movie are exceptional, everyone is undoubtedly at the top of their game here - in particular, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr, whose characters have now evolved to such an extent that their desperation and desire for vengeance (especially in Thor's case) is truly apparent in the execution of their roles. Zoe Saldana's Gamora is also wonderful in this movie, I definitely like the character a lot more than before due to her heartfelt speech to Thanos before he trades her for the soul stone: \"All my life I dreamed of a day, a moment, when you got what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now, you kill and torture and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.\" AMAZING WRITING! Not to mention, the special effects, oh my word, they are out of this world! (Literally!) If this isn't nominated for Visual effects come Oscar Time, there will be riots! The whole thing is just spectacular. It is certainly heartbreaking at the end to see all these characters being turned to dust, especially ones who are the more recent Avengers, but it certainly raises the stakes to have the movie end on such a gripping, apocalyptic note! Of course, many people believe these characters will be revived - come on, are you really going to kill off Black Panther? - somehow in Avengers 4, especially as there is already GOTG 3 in the works as well as Spiderman 2 & Black Panther 2. This probably means some of the OG Avengers are gonna hit the bucket, but we've had a good run with them and it's time for some new faces. Fingers crossed Bucky becomes the new cap (Seb Stan still has 3 movies left in his contract!) Will cry all over again I'm sure next April but I just cannot wait to go see it!!! Thank God Captain Marvel arrives next March - this girl gonna kick some purple ass in Avengers 4 no doubt! If you haven't seen this movie yet, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GOOOO!!!", "Ever since Thanos was teased at the end of the first 'Avengers', fans have been waiting for this epic conclusion (part one of two). 'Infinity War' lives up to the six-year build up. It's quite an amazing feat, with every Marvel Cinematic Universe hero appearing in this film (or in Hawkeye and Ant-Man's case, briefly referenced). What follows is an epic global and space battle as Thanos fights to collect the six infinity stones. Marvel's patience in establishing all these characters over the past 10 years pays off, as 'Infinity Wars' gets to the action straight away, and rarely lets up. Fans will love the blending of heroes from the various franchises (seeing Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy together was a personal highlight and is probably the funniest part of the movie). It definitely makes up for the disappointing 'Age of Ultron'. Without giving away crucial spoilers, Thanos' path for the infinity stones dramatically changes the MCU setup, leaving fans speculating as to where the MCU will go next. Luckily, there's another Avengers movie in 2019 (and an Ant-Man sequel in July 2018). Watch this space...", "After a reading a negative review or two I really don't understand what goes on in people's mind. After watching avengers infinity war, I can't really describe how epic-much this film is not to mention this is just part 1 of the infinity war. This movie gets straight to the point of having to get everyone back together in hopes of putting an end to thanos before worst comes worst. Before reading any comments, see the movie urself and be ur own judge", "Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun, awesome, and a great watch. I was worried that this would be another huge dissapointment for me like Civil War was, where the trailer was better than the movie. I have to say, they handled his movie pretty well. Still, there are huge pacing issues but it's a comic book movie with a lot of characters so i've got to give it a pass. But my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't feel like an \"Avengers\" movie- they're all split up and such. The theme barely plays and when it does it doesn't feel quite right. The Russos don't really understand what the Avengers are, based on this movie. It doesn't feel quite as complete as the previous two. Well, this was a good movie, worth the hype, but I hope they improve for the next and final one. Part 2 is usually better, right?", "Nothing to say about it................best super hero fim thqt i seen ever..", "This review is for English reports for college so do bare, with me if there are any SPaG errors or if I am missing any details.  So I finally got round to seeing Avengers Infinity Wars yesterday, and I have to say I am completely mind blown. This is probably the best movie of 2018 heck even best of the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Over the past decade or so MCU has been doing very well with their movies and so far I have enjoyed if not all but majority of their movies (Iron Man 3 not so much). Ever since 2008, there have been over 18 movies stating with the first Iron Man movie.   If you haven't caught up with the movies or if you are missing any I would recommend you watch them first before you buy tickets to watch this movie or continue reading my review because there will be spoilers as I go along.  As usual the acting, special effects, camera angel and plot of movie was all good. All though the only problem I found with this movie was that too many things were going on at once. But luckily that never put the actual down.  There is a lot of Easter eggs which may surprise for example when Thanos is about to claim an infinity stone there is a similar figure that resembles the Red Skull and towards the post credits before Nick Fury turns into dust you see the symbol for Captain Marvel on Nick's phone which may foreshadow Captain Marvels appearance. But I am very surprised that Nick Fury never contacted her for the first or the second movie but he contacted her for this. Towards the beginning of the movie I wish we got to see how the Asgardians got knockout by Thanos which was still puzzling to me and where Hawkeye and Ant-Man was during the movie and did they disappear like the other few people or are they still there. Also I am not really sure if I am comfortable with the fact that has a cyborg eye and the Stormbreaker (which is owned by Beta Ray Bill in the comics) hammer because he lost both in the previous movie, Black Widow having blonde hair or even Captain America having facial hair and regular shield instead of Wakanda making him the same since they have metal as previous one he lost in Captain America Civil War and I wonder why The Hulk was resentencing Bruce Banner to transform. The best scenes are all of the fight scenes with Thanos and the black order, the bit where Teenage Groot gives Peter and Rocket attitude, the chemistry between Rocket and The White Wolf and when Ned does a distraction for Peter. The scene when Spider-Man is about to disappear and he is crying for his life to Tony saying \"I don't wanna go\" I nearly cried at that scene and when nearly all of New York is about to disappear. There is a few deaths which you might cry over in film but I won't say who because I think I have spoiled plenty. I am glad this movie had the Hulkbuster and the Spider-Suit. All and all Stan Lee and the rest of the crew did an amazing job. If you haven't seen Avengers Infinity Wars yet I would recommend you go watch it. 10/10 I could even give it 50 or 100 if I could. Can't wait for Part 2 next year and the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp movie coming out in a few months' time.", "I'd say, it's the best Avengers movie. Yep, it's not a great movie itself, but it doesn't make you facepalm your head off like Age of Ultron, Winter soldier and Civil war do.\nTwo reasons why it is not 10/10:\n1. The give Thanos damn stones. Why TF they cannot sacrifice 3 characters to save a bunch of others, nevermind trillions of creatures among the universe?\n2. They killed all NEW characters. Iron Man character became really boring at this point, and they didn't even filmed Hawkeye, and Widow's... well, they still have a us for the character, I just don't like Johannson :s Anyway. With all this they kill Strange and SPIDEY. The only thing I really enjoyed in the film was Holland's act, and then they kill him. Bravo. Thanks for killing Falcon tho.", "Watching this characters together fighting this villain that does fell like a a meneace for our heroes is perfect every character has his/her time to shine!", "I'm DC Comics fan, but I admit that Marvel is better.\nThis movie is complex, both due to many characters, but especially to the negative character.\nIt's designed to look forward to the sequel.", "Wow! End to end, not a second can be missed. Incredible. I love this movie it has everything from superhero's, action, comedy and darkens. What an ending, never seen an ending like this in a marvel movie.", "After being on Marvel train since 2008, I am finally hopping off because I am burnt out on their formulaic superhero movie plot. Black Panther was the best Marvel movie to date because it took a chance and stepped out of the traditional superhero movie format and told a compelling, yet relevant story with a great hero and a well-rounded villain in Killmonger. Its weakest moments occurred when it had to conform to the Marvel formula. Thor: Ragnarok was also a great movie because it stopped taking itself too seriously and was fun and refreshing. Yet, this movie rubbed me the wrong way. Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie because Marvel played it safe again with its formula. Thanos was a great villain and this was really his movie. The Russo brothers already showed their greatness when reinventing Captain America with the excellent sequels Captain America: Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, which was the real Avenger 3 and way better than this movie. I can tell from this movie like with Joss Whedon's Avengers 2, the brothers creativity was stifled by studio heads thinking more about milking the movie for as much of the billions its worth and will make regardless instead of creating a great movie audience can enjoy. \nI have four main annoyances with this movie. The First Annoyance: Infinity War was advertised as not being split into two movies anymore and it was only going to be one movie. Which is why the ending was confusing along with the post credits because the studio did not inform the public it was going to be split into two movies leaving the audience scratching their heads after expecting a complete movie. The remaining audience members who stayed behind to watch the post credits laughed at Samuel L. Jackson famously about to curse being as confused as we were about the ending. As we exited the theater, one brave audience member bravely asked out loud if anyone got the ending. Everyone burst into laughter because none of us did. The Second annoyance: There was no need to have a second movie. Just like Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part One and Two, this movie could have been completed in one movie. There is no need for a second movie because thirty minutes more and the already long movie could have ended in one satisfying movie. The ending is like watching the final act of a movie and then the film abruptly ending right before the final scene. It was a cheap shot from the executives to get more money out of the pubic and introduce new Marvel superheroes when the movie was already oversaturated with unnecessary superheroes who only spoke a few lines to say, \"Hey, I'm in the movie.\" The only relevant characters in this movie are Thanos, Gamora, Dr. Strange, Tony Stark, Thor, and maybe Vision because he is an Infinity Stone carrier. The rest was completely unnecessary filler. The Third Annoyance: Defying the laws of Physics. I am no genius but if Thanos if stronger than Hulk and Thor, then how can Iron Man and Captain America survive a punch from him? Shouldn't they both be dead? Oh and speaking of death. My Final Annoyance: The Deaths. It's quite obvious who's coming back for sequels to their own individual movie franchises and who didn't renew their contracts? Why make the ones you know are coming back for sequels disappear and then keep the ones who didn't renew their contracts? It's like they are afraid to kill off Tony Stark and Captain America. Robert Downey Jr. is in his fifties now, and Chris Evans is tired of the superhero gig just like Hugh Jackman was of playing Wolverine for seventeen years. Give them a noble death and passed on the torch to the next generation. Yet, both characters survived moments that should have killed them. Another complaint was that the deaths in this movie had no emotional meaning or impact. You know it's a superhero movie and if characters are popular enough, the studio heads will bring them back from the dead in the sequel or starring in a TV show. So moments when you should mourn the lost of a character, you feel nothing when that character is killed off. Which made the ending more bizarre on the studio's part. Diehard Marvel fans are going to say it's the greatest movie because they have been conditioned to love Marvel and go to every Marvel movie, even waiting during the five minutes of credits to see two extra scenes. Yet, for someone who is burnt out on seeing grown men running around in their underwear fighting each other, I'm hopping off the train. Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok were both great movies, yet, I don't appreciate the stunt the movie executives pulled, and I feel like I wasted two and half hours of my life. I finally understood the ending, but it still could have been wrapped up in one movie. So if you love Marvel, go watch the movie. If you're a casual fan, wait until part two comes out and watch this movie right before you go see part two.", "Movie is awesome. Far far bettter than DC. The climax is way beyond our thoughts.", "This movie destroyed me. It was an emotional rollercoaster. I LOVED IT. Bring on the next one so I can die a little more on the inside!", "Lit movie, even more lit if you know the MCU - RIP Spidey - or not", "And I cried for the remainder of the movie\nalthough at that point there was probably only about 5 minutes left", "I love all the actors to battle with another bad guys and I love iron man is cool because I want to be one myself this time for my birthday is on25 October is alright I love avengers is really cool I want to get a DVD and poster and also tshirt and pjs and my pillow case", "First time we seen this many characters interact and their interaction was awesome and realistic. Everyone is great. Truly Thor shines in this movie the most. Thor and Rocket chemistry was awesome and shown they have mutual respect. Respect for Groot to save Thor by cutting of his arm for the handle.  There are laughs and sadness throughout this movie. Tonal change depending on the character was spot on. Thor wakanda entry was the best scene in the movie whilst showing relieve on other avengers face and theme playing. Thanos was amazing and truly the best comic book villain in a movie. From start where he brutally beats up the Hulk showing he is not a force to be messed with and at the end where he is victorious and has a happy ending. This is truly the best comic book movie ever made from start to finish.", "Just amazing, greatest superhero movie of all time.\nI love it", "Although I was checking the score on a few sites, I have not yet read any reviews or comments on Avengers: IW, so this opinion is based solely on my experience earlier today. This movie is up there with the best fantasy epics of my adolescence, or with some of the greatest comic book/superhero movies of more recent years. It's huge. It's epic. It's amazing. It's a damn well orchestrated symphony. It's Beethoven's 9th. For me, it doesn't get any better. But...unfortunately, not everyone will think that, or have the same experience. Why? Because it can't be considered a standalone movie and it can't be enjoyed as one. It is the top of the pyramid but you can't just land on it, you have to climb the whole pyramid first. It's a cinematic orgasm, but you have to go through the sex to get to it. It requires previous MCU knowledge, without it is just like watching the Superbowl with no understanding of the game. Many scenes, dialogues, lines, actions and choices of certain characters...won't work without it and will have less to no emotional impact on the viewer. So yes, for Marvel vets is the (first half of a) Champions League Final of all Marvel movies, for others is just an explosive game with perhaps to many players on the field. In Spidey's words: Sorry, I can't remember all your names...\"\n Well I can, and I will never forget any of them...", "Thoroughly enjoyed the film, lots of content but all fell into place", "Avengers: Infinity War is the BEST Marvel movie of all time. ( My opinion, don't hate me ) The cgi was remarkable , the screen writing was INPECKABLE , the acting was amazing and the list goes on. But tbh I SPOILER WARNING I Thanos at some points doesn't seem like a bad guy , sure he wants to kill half the universe and succeeded. But he wanted to kill the bad half ( Don't ask me why Tom Holland, Chris Pat and Chadwick Boseman were killed) But he wanted to live in peace. But if you saw in the end credits that Nick Fury sends a message to Captain Marvel (Also getting her a stand alone film) meaning that Captain Marvel might be the super weapon. And if you read this far than I got treat for you. I looked online for Avengers 4 and saw the cast and I can tell you that The Black Panther will come back. Don't believe me? Link to full cast list. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/fullcredits\nTrust Me Tom Holland will return. Marvel can't kill Spiderman. But who knows", "Read through some of the reviews and, as someone has previously stated, it's beyond comprehension (and human reasoning) to downvote this movie for the stupidest reasons (no more superhoeroes movies, no plot, everybody dying, too much violence, etc.).\nThis is IT, it's the most epic movie in the MCU. \nFrom Stan Lee's one-liner (brilliant guy, don't care what others say about him) to Thor's shocking self sacrifice, this has been nothing short of EPIC. \nFor me, if I were to choose a particular moment in the movie that moved me, it would have to be the arrival of Thor on Wakanda (builing up after the heart-melting moment of self sacrifice to get that Stormbreaker, with much needed sacrifice from the grumpiest Twig ever).\nAll in all, an advice for people out there:\n> If you have seen the MCU movies until now, this is the cherry on top - part1, ergo, a MUST SEE.\n> If you haven't seen the MCU movies (or seen just few of them), be open-minded, and give it go.\nAnd remember, 2019 will bring us Cherry on top - part 2 (with the highly anticipated appearance of Adam Warlock, Captain Marvel and ... the Soul Stone).\nWill probably watch it again this weekend.", "A decade ago the Marvel Cinematic Universe started with Iron Man. I don't think anyone disputes they had a good thing going from the get-go; however, some people (such as myself) feel that SOME (NOT ALL) of the MCU movies have gotten \"Disnyfied\" (*cough* Thor: Ragnarok *cough*).  I must admit, I had all but abandoned the MCU ever since Avengers: Age of Ultron. I feel that every movie since Age of Ultron has been hit-or-miss, and have only continued watching in hopes that the next installment be a groundbreaking rebirth for the MCU. *****I didn't like Age of Ultron because it was essentially the same movie as The Avengers but with a subtitle, Civil War both because it just wasn't a good movie AND it wasn't comic-correct, Ragnarok because it was just plain DUMB, and Black Panther because it was WAY too slow!*****  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with Infinity War! I recently read some of the comics it's \"based on\" (Thanos Quest & Infinity Gauntlet), and the series that follow (Infinity War, Infinity Crusade & Infinity Abyss), and was again pleasantly surprised to see some scenes straight from the comics (such as Hulk crashing into Doctor Strange's \"home\", Groot wrap up Thanos and \"the snap\" to name a few). As we all know, Disney doesn't have the rights to the X-Men yet (soon), so I can't call their lack of appearance \"inaccurate\". Even though \"the snap\" may seem like a douchey way to guarantee people see \"part 2\", it IS straight out of the comics (DON'T FRET PEOPLE! MOST CHARACTERS WILL BE BACK IN PART 2!).  *****My ONLY complaint is that Thanos' quote from the trailer (\"Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But this...does put a smile on my face.\") DIDN'T make it into the movie!?***** Enough of me babbling, GO SEE THIS MOVIE (this is coming from someone who went in with little-to-no expectations AND read the comics)!", "I was waiting so much to make a review for this film, and now after watching it I can finally do it! Even though there is no Ant-Man, The Wasp and Hackeye (sorry if I'm forgeting someone else) this movie has pretty much everything! I have a feeling though the upcoming Avengers movie will be even bigger. I only have one questions to some critics mentioning the fact that the movie last 2 and a half hours, like it's something bad...well I didn't see you complaining about any Lord of the Ring films or any other movie that is more than 3 hours long... When the movie ended I felt like I didn't have enough, never felt bored! Thanos is badass! Couldn't and Shouldn't be anyone else in this movie. The end was unexpected since it's an unfinished chapter but you get to see what the 6 infinity stones are capable of! The post credits scenes was really good, I cannot wait to see first the Captain Marvel movie and then to see if she's gonna be in the 4th Avengers movie (I think she's confirmed) and then how can she change the whole situation. Overall it was a breathtaking movie and definitely an experience when you to the theatre. I liked the development in many key characters like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and also the new Iron Suit for Spider-Man. I would like to see more from Star-Lord especially after all his new found strength in the 2nd Guardians film, maybe we will get to see more in the next film!", "No fan of a character or a group of characters is gonna be happy if they feel like their favs are given the short end of the stick, so the IMO appalling reduction of Team Cap/Bucky and even any real dynamic between T'Challa and Bucky - and I mean not a sentence - is gonna go over well. Especially Team Cap hasn't been around since 2016. This film reduced beloved and fascinating characters to glorified cameos. So that's a thing; and for me THAT was awful. Pretty bitter about that. It's been pointed out to me that this is \"Thanos' movie.\". OK. But another thing is that IMO it was too much, for me. I liked James Brolins's Thanos. But re Darth Vader I would have liked smaller doses. Darth Vader made a huge impact in scenes in just a few moments. There WERE times when Thanos was utterly chilling. Other times I was just getting bored with him, and tired of seeing that big purple head on screen. A lot. (Hela by contrast every move I wanted to watch.) So if I didn't get Team Cap, unfortunately what I DID get wasn't welcome - a huge dose of Guardians, Spiderman, Thor, Ironman. Don't get me wrong, I like these characters just fine. Own figures and everything. But I didn't like GOTG2 that much - enough that I'd already said to myself I'd never go to another Guardians in theater.  So about halfway through IW, when the *drama* between Gamora and Thanos was going on - and for me it felt like it went on and on - I started disengaging from this movie. Felt trapped watching a GOTG 2.5 movie - which specifically I didn't want to see - and like I was watching a soap opera. A PREDICTABLE soap opera, e.g. seguing over to scenes straight from LOTR \"the way is shut\" and Indiana Jones. And tropes. The idea of sacrifice to gain an object or power is an old one. But far as I know, the Infinity Stones don't work that way, and they don't demand sacrifices. The Soul Stone IS very dangerous; the only stone that is sentient. It seeks souls. But far as I know it doesn't DEMAND sacrifices and was more likely to just suck in Thanos when acquired. Also, why would the Space Stone behave like judge and jury with Red Skull? Why him? The movie tries to cover that, but for me it was a trope/fan service just to shoehorn in Red Skull. Forced and not needed. And all the drama around the Soul Stone (Well of Souls trope) drags on for a while. Gamora's end boringly predictable. If it's even an end.... This movie has a lot going on - there were things I appreciated. Mark Ruffalo IMO terrific actor and incredibly effective in pleading with Tony early on, and great comedy later. Thor was more the grim hero than I had ever seen him be; Hemsworth did amazingly well. Loved Peter Dinklage and the whole motif of the space forge; Groot kind of coming of age to help; Rocket had great CGI and expression. Powerful use of Heimdal and truly heroic to the last. Loki finally becoming more (and I am really hoping that line \"you will never be a god\" leads to him coming back - somehow). Wanda and Vision IMO are the Russos and writers at their best - neither too much or too little, beautiful script, doesn't wallow in sentiment, and also some very nice moments with Vision and Cap later. For me tho - more or less fresh off the films of 2017 - OK, now I'm stuck in a space ship with these guys quipping (yep, I like Dr. Strange too and love Wong) and basically getting another dose (third time around on film) of \"Mr. Stark I want to fight/go home Peter/how dangerous this is/Peter being innocent\".Then Spiderman 1.5 jumps over to Guardians 2.5. It was fun, for a while. But to me it also felt like re-hash of 2017 too. *Disengage* And finally - marketed in probably the best TV spot - Wakanda. Aside from catching up on Team Cap, the Wakanda battle was what I wanted most to see - I mean, it's the Russos right? The fights of TWS and CW? I was expecting FABULOUS things - Bucky well and off the chain mowing down Outriders like corn, flashing knives, T'Challa's graceful and ruthless acrobatics, M'Baku a force unbridled rampaging across the plains, Falcon twisting and turning and SLAYING...and...fizzle. Far as I can tell the camera gave everyone maybe 30 seconds and that's that. So much for Helm's Deep in Africa. Perhaps most egregious - after 2 years is the blowing through Cap and Bucky's reunion, Unbelievable. A powerful friendship that has withstood nearly a century, fueled 3 beautiful films (some of the best in the MCU), and there wasn't 30 seconds of these warriors even commenting, say, on the World War they had already seen and the end they were facing. Plenty of time for stuff on Titan tho - jokes and tears and fireworks and just plain silliness (like nobody thought to cut off Thanos' arm with all those lasers?). Time for more Spidey tears but Cap and Bucky didn't merit a few lines, or Cap and Sam? Natasha and Bruce? T'challa and Okoye or even T'Challa and Bucky? M'baku as his warriors fell? Anything? FAIL. Never mind just handing Bucky a new arm, and no idea what it does or anything about it. I think I could count the lines Team Cap has on my hands. Heck, I really like Nebula but she barely does anything except get tortured (tho I did like the hatred between her and Thanos and her hooking up with Iron Man - that has a lot of interesting potential). The writers have said if characters don't show up in this film, they will show up in the next. But IMO it's too late for what this film might have been, and there was no need to imbalance it this much in the first place. Also, I just don't trust the Russos/writers/marketing/Feige at this point, in the sense that I felt these last 2 films should really be a homage to Cap and Tony and Natasha and Bucky and Falcon and Hulk e.g. the originals that made the MCU great. IW2, I suspect, will be too crammed with characters (including Ravagers showing up), Feige's next phases (Captain Marvel) and whatever. So while there was much to appreciate IMO in this film, for me it was a bitter disappointment and not really a re-watchable film, even, like Ragnarok. I'd actually rate it 6-7/10. (It's stained IW2 for me a year before that movie. OMG I kind of dread IW2 at this point. Probably more Spidey and Guardians stuff.)  As for the \"deaths\" except for Heimdall and Loki, I didn't feel much of anything. Gamora felt like a trope and I had become so disengaged I didn't care - plus it all happens so fast. Will give the Russos/writers credit for pulling this off tho, even if I didn't like the treatment. Emotionally tho - really appalled by the choices made by the filmmakers and I would have preferred Marvel be more honest about this film vs. marketing like an Avengers movie. It's a Thanos/Guardians/IM/Spidy movie with some DS and few cameos.", "It's just iconic. I've got nothing to say more.

Avengers: Infinity War is such a great movie, I am not a fan of Avengers movies, but this is definitely a great movie. One week before the movie is released in my country, there are many spoilers, but the movie is still interesting to be watched. The main story of the movie is quite simple, there is a common enemy named Thanos, who wanted to become the greatest god ever in the universe. The first plot is already beginning with a war between the good and the bad, and how the relationship between Avengers team is united easily. Yes, because they face the one and only enemy. In this game, I am quite supporter for Thanos, look at him, he is on war alone with Avengers team. The Director is really genius to use all special effects and other things that made this movie a great superhero series. I hope there is the continuity of the plots, because it has in unexplained ending for me. Even though there is post-credit scene, yet the final war is infinity, well maybe this is the meaning for the title \"Infinity\". In other superhero movies, we could guess that the main evil will be dead or failed, but here in Avengers: Infinity War, the happy ending lovers will be disappointed a lot. Despite of that, I really appreciate all actors and crew, wow they are all seniors and well-experienced, I could not imagine how much they spent for this movie, even though it is clearly stated in IMDB Pro that this is one of box office movies this week, I still could not imagine this movie has great effects and actions. Bravo bravo bravo", "Arguably best marvel movie so far! you dont have to worried about marvel movies who have been known to be too light and have too many scenes that break the moment or too many not well timed jokes or unfunny jokes etc. it have jokes in it but its just the right amount not too many and IT IS funny i mean like real funny. and it can make you hold your breath for almost from the start to the end of the movie. it have a lot of suspenseful moments. and there's one post credit scene YOU DONT WANNA MISS! luckily i didnt know what the post credit scene was until i saw it myself at the theatre and i just smile outside but was screaming inside like a little child when i finally saw it. man im gonna watch it for the second time and im still as enthusiastic as i was before i watched the movie for the first time. p.s pardon my bad english ;D", "Action packed, has it's little jokes to make you laugh, apart from that.

There are so many sub plots, that it's hard to keep track of what's everyone doing, nevertheless the Russo brothers succeeded in that. \nNo shaky cam, breathtaking action, amazing CGI - Beautiful viewing experience.\nThis isn't a movie, it's an experience that will leave you wondering about the sequel.", "It all started with Iron Man in 2008, and every subsequent Marvel film for the last decade has either contributed directly or indirectly to Avengers/Infinity War. This film has action throughout but is also heavy on story line as all the individual Marvel Tales of every preceding film converge to the epic point of conflict to a universal threat! With most characters faithfully depicted from all the movies we loved involved, this is a Journey into Mystery; the Ultimate Marvel Team-Up, with Tales of Suspense & Tales to Astonish thrown in for good measure! Two Thumbs ( both of mine ) waaaaaaaaaaaay Up !!", "Plot; Thanos makes his move to unite the Infinity Stones so that he can bring balance to the universe. This year the MCU turns 10 years old, and Infinity War (the 19th film in the MCU) represents the culmination of that carefully laid story that started w/Iron Man. W/the exception of a few characters, the gang is all here, and an effort is made to give everyone a key role or at least a moment. It's not an easy task, but Infinity War (w/it's 2 1/2 hour runtime) does manage its cinematic roll call reasonably well. At times the massive cast comes at a cost, as characters fall out of the story for large stretches of time, but the film itself never stops to catch its breath.  The action here is almost nonstop, but I found very little of it compelling despite being technically impressive. Even w/the obvious stakes, I just never felt that dramatic tension; or only in fits and starts. The tone is serious and often grim, but that tried and true MCU formula remains, so there's humor as well and most of it lands.  If the MCU has had a consistent criticism its the villains, but that's not an issue here. Thanos is not only impressively rendered physically, but he's got a depth and a mission that go beyond your standard mustache twirling baddie. Our heroes are the same characters we've grown to love, and it was nice to see a few of them known more for their humor get some dramatic depth. The ending is one I didn't see coming and will leave even the casual fan's mouth agape.  There's a lot to like about Infinity War, but for me the whole was less than the sum of its parts.", "If you are a die hard Marvel fan or have only see a few of the movies you will like this movie. It's so fun and packed of awesome action scenes. There are some problems but what movie doesn't. I have been waiting 10 years for this and I can easily say it was worth the wait, I will be going to see it again", "It was just amazing! I have no words. But this says I have to write a longer review. It was just the right amount of action and great story! All the characters are just amazing!", "As a huge marvel fun. I have to say infinty war is the best movie of all the marvel universe. Also for me it has to be in the top 5 movie in imdb. Besides the senario. The graphics of movie was insane. Tony's nanotechmology suits were amazing. In the comics by the way, the thing from thanos can be fixeble.", "I'd be a diehard Marvel fan. I've seen every one of these movies... sometimes I went to the theater... sometimes I just waited till it was made available and I could watch whenever for free. No matter where or how I saw them I almost always walked saying the same thing... Eh. When Iron Man came out I was still a teenager and I really enjoyed it... but after that it was honestly the most mature of the films until Infinity War or should I say Marvel's Dark Knight LOL! Still had all the Marvel humor but was much darker or really deeper than anything Ive seen from this studio. I bet DC has to be feeling pretty embarrassed about Marvel's CG villain!! Holy crap. Seriously DC... and i'm a fan but go back to the drawing board bc Thanos just literally shamed everything you've done since Dark Knight Trilogy. Obviously I won't spoil anything but I definitely had tears in my eyes at the end... not because I love everything Marvel but bc I was truly that moved. This was a hard earned 10/10... all credit due to the directors Joe and Anthony Russo! The years of hard work I'm sure went into this REALLY SHOWED. Inspiring.", "Awesome awesome awesome!! Best was hearing the reactions of the crowd on each scene (don't want to spoil it ;))", "After being teased for years, we finally get to properly meet Thanos. A great villian which Marvel haven't been able to get done quite right. We watch Thanos search for the Infinity Stones and The Avengers and Guardians of The Galxy try to stop him. The movie never has a dull moment and deals with the massive cast perfectly. I went in with high expectations and this movie exceeded them. The dark ending was unexpected and made me want more. I can't wait till we see what happens next.", "10/10 and this is why..! I've watched this film three times now so I can get a true picture of it and honestly I enjoyed it more, the more I watched it. To juggle a huge cast this size and make it work is an accomplishment, and boy is this an accomplishment. Each character shines in their own way and the comedy is placed well, so not to take away the depth, the pain, the suffering and severity off this story arc. The SFX is some of the best ever seen in my opinion, yes there are some slight flaws here and there, but not enough to take your mind of the story on screen. Thanos looks amazing and for the true comic fans like myself Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers and the team at Marvel Studios have excelled in bringing the dark Titan from page to screen.  Josh Brolin is totally worthy of playing this nemesis and Brolin adds heart, pain, power and a sadness to this character, as always the Marvel team hits a home run with the casting. Every little detail is put into Thanos. For a purple giant he looks realistic, from an eyebrow movement or a cheek twitch to a full on capable gladiator in battle stance, he looks like a living, breathing being. Where does this film stand against the rest of the MCU, well it's right up there in the top three. Some people might not like or even fully understand the ending, but the possibilities it sets up for the future of the MCU only leaves me with questions and excitement! This film has made some choices that surprised me as a comic collector and fan of 33 years, but I honestly thank them for that, the Russo brothers not only promised, but also delivered the film we've been awaiting.", "10 years in the making and the Russo's knocked it out of the ballpark. I went it hoping all the heroes would get ample screen time without the movie feeling rushed or plot holes or things being unanswered and was not disappointed. The movie is balanced with bits of humor but also very serious. They really did a good job with Thanos' character, he is the perfect villain. Just a all around action packed, adrenaline ride!", "Wow... paying off ten years of excellence was mostly worthwhile and genuinely shocking. This movie assumes you are a fan and know these characters. It jumps right in to the action with no set up or exposition. You are IN this movie right from the start.  The development and ground work from the other 18 films pave the way for a truly emotional drama and mind-blowing experience. And that's just what this movie is... an experience. It's a thrill ride start to finish including genuine \"white knuckle\" fear for some favorite characters. A valid complaint would have to be that this is without a doubt a part 1. It's an incomplete adventure. Yet, having to sit an entire year contemplating what we saw and what's going to happen now only adds to the fun. The after credits scenes is probably the best of any Marvel film. Also, some characters really do get very little screen time. Surprised at how little Cap, Hulk and Black Panther had to do.  Overall, Infinity War is every bit as epic as advertised and a year can't fly by fast enough.", "Pretty much what you'd expect with a Marvel film, but more", "Wauw, what great movie. Enjoyed every minute of it, worth the wait. Great storyline, great characters.", "This HAS to be the best movie I've ever seen in my life. I just walked into the cinema a couple of hours ago, and I walked out knowing that I've never seen a movie like this before. It brings fantastic enjoyment that also brings hard times whilst you sit back and relax on the comfortable seats. You walk out of this movie, realising that everything you have just seen, suddenly tears you apart inside from the love that these characters have given us over the past 10 years. It brings the BEST villain a film could ever afford. Bringing you stunning new detail of evil into a universe that has been going around for a long time. It also brings more excitement to what is yet to come. The CGI is mind-blowing, everything just appears to get better and better every second, with stunning new plot twists, character team-ups, new fights and battles, and a lot of surprises you never would expect before the film came out. It creates a movie that involves characters like the original Avengers: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor fight for their lives, along with new greetings that we've come to love, whilst the battles ensues as they grieve and fight to survive. It's a must-see, a movie that is never to be missed. What are you waiting for??? It's a blockbuster hit that is expected to be at the Oscars!! DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!", "Absolutely blown away with how good this film is. 10 years in the making with all the hype surrounding it and did not disappoint. From first minute it is unrelenting and pace never drops. This is a must see for not just marvel fans but anyone that loves an action film", "Most movies/tv shows don't really make me feel or relate to the characters. But this definitely did. They did such a great job with Thanos. He feels more like an actual character while also being the big-bad CGI villain. He is easily the best Marvel villain. Can't say the same about the Black Order though. Some scenes are almost guaranteed to leave you at the edge of your seat, especially the fight scenes. Those were incredible! This is by far my favorite Marvel movie!  I give it a 9.5/10!", "What freakin movie this is awesome the best movie from the mcu yet", "Marvel and Disney did a fantastic job on keeping this movie entertaining and funny. They made the mad Titan more humanistic though which I thought was a great touch but sime hardcore fans may not like it. I still think they should introduce characters such as the Adam Warlock, the Beyonder, Lady Death and the Enternals (ie. Living Tribunal, Watchers) to complete the series. But all in all they did a great job.", "Everything about this film was perfect, except that it confirmed the crappy Captain Marvel movie. If you read any of the original Infinity Gauntlet comics, this was as true to them as it could be in the MCU and I was extremely happy with it.", "Marvel movies is know for the exitment adventure and action that they provide to the audience through the years. This movie certainly did that. However killing more than half of the super heroes and just end the movie like that is a BAD ending. I undertand is a second part schedule for next year. However if you see the cast for the upcoming project all the dead characters are not coming on that movie. So that means they are all still DEAD specially Spider-Man. Marvel tried to do a masterpiece with this movie but did completely the opposite. Great movie and the worst to my opinion.", "When I came into this movie I was expecting another marvel movie but I walked out thinking it was great. It is amazing how all of these characters can be in one movie and it not be a catastrophic fail. A 10/10 in my books", "Avengers Infinity War Review (SPOILERS): Amazing. Best Marvel film to date by far. This film ticked every box you could have hoped for and really opened up several options for them to take in Avengers 4. The film overall was easily a 9.5/10, my favourite Marvel movie yet and I can't wait till the continuation is released next year. Thanos was amazing. You could really see the goal and aspirations he had weren't just for an evil purpose of hurting the Avengers or an old enemy but to really help the universe and fix the finite of space and resources he says the universe has. This really shows a strong and unforgettable villain when you are able to relate to the character and they also have emotion and mourn. This is clear when he has to trade the soul stone for Gamora's life it breaks him showing his true love he had for his adopted daughter even though he needed to do so to complete his aspirations. You can clearly see the film as Thanos' film, following his path to snapping his fingers and completing his goal of universal peace and completion. All character dynamics were amazing. Especially the new ones. I loved the character dynamic between Thor and the Guardians and between Iron Man and Doctor Strange. The way they managed to give all the characters screen time and development was perfect considering the large amount of cast the film had to offer. The job the Russo brothers did was phenomenal. The way it was all pieced together was just perfect and I honestly can't think of many ways they could have improved the film. Every actor did an amazing job reprising their roles. The cast they have for these films has always been outstanding and seeing them all work together was just perfect. My favourite character in this film by far has to be Thor. After the start of the film you can really see Thor's drive to defeat Thanos after he has lost everything important to him. Starting off the film by killing Heimdall and Loki was a complete shock for me and it led to Thor's amazing path to make Stormbreaker and get revenge for his brother and best friend. He even manages to be the only avenger to cause real pain to Thanos before he snaps his fingers. I also loved the way he was written with every character just with the jokes and it was just perfect. My favourite Guardian without a doubt would have to be Drax. His one liners or just utter stupidity had me in bits every time. Cannot get enough of his character. The way this film ended was always going to be Thanos snapping his fingers and half the universe being destroyed. But what happened after was a complete shock for me. The characters they chose to fade into dust were very specific to lead into the next film. It was a very emotional ending but all credit goes to Tom Holland for actually bringing tears to my eyes. His performance was phenomenal and outstanding and he was honestly just amazing in the film. His \"death\" felt so real and the dynamic between him and Iron Man was incredible. I honestly had the highest expectations for this film and they reached them and I cannot wait for Avengers 4.", "It beautiful visual effects, fantastic directing, emotional, epic, funny, fun, dark, intense, etc. The movie is mostly action and adventure so there technically isn't a build up. Instead the movie starts off with a bang all the way until the end of the film. It has a balance of almost every genre and the Villain was extremely well written with a reasonable backstory behind his name.", "SFX: Well rendered. It was nothing special, but it was good enough to where it didn't become a distraction for me in any part of the movie. Music: Very generic and forgettable. It killed a lot of what could have been tense moments. Action: Nothing special or memorable. You don't really feel the sense that you're dealing with super powered, or super enhanced, characters in this movie. It feels like a generic action movie. It also doesn't help that the characters were constantly cracking jokes throughout these tense moments, and it also doesn't help that the trailers revealed the best moments. Story: Very predictable, like all of these MCU movies. There was no real build up to the end of the movie; from the beginning to the end, it was just non-stop action and jokes, and this got old quick. There were very few moments of any real tension, or a sense of urgency and seriousness from the characters. \nThe plot was all over the place, and the pace of the movie was painfully slow.  Highlights: Josh Brolin was amazing as Thanos.  Lowlights: The amount of jokes in this movie, and the lack of a proper build up, really killed the sense of dread and urgency that should have been in this story. Overall: A waste of 3 hours. No real development, or proper story telling, and no real sense of tension. The movie relies on action and jokes to keep you interested. In other words, it's just another generic Marvel super hero movie.", "A great fitting to10th anniversary of MCU.\nThe plot line, the editing, the pacing etc.\nJust mind blowing!!!!! Must see.!!! Even I was a D.C. fan", "Infinity war is a long awaited and most anticipated movie(at least for every MCU fan). Fans have got a lot of excitement for the movie and Infinity War doesn't disappoint them at any point. Our favorite superhero characters from MCU unite against Thanos , who is on a mission to collect all the six Infinity Stones in his Infinity Gauntlet. There are a lot of characters in the movie but the directors have managed to provide all an adequate amount of screen time. All characters make their presence felt and showcase their full power against Thanos, some of which you have never seen. Their are some ground breaking action scenes, heartbreaks , emotions, 'deaths' and amidst of this the movie is also successful in providing the audience a good amount of laugh. I know that the fans don't need an review before rushing to the theaters but I assure you that you get in there grab your seat and popcorns and in the end the movie just leaves you wanting for more (like a part II). And don't miss the post credit scene.", "The movie is too good. Hats off to the star cast of the movie, marvel, Russo Brothers, Stan Lee and Kevin", "This movie an unapologetic perfection of a movie for Marvel fans. For those who have paid attention and appreciate the pure joy Marvel Studios has brought to cinemas for the past 10 years you will not be disappointed. There is twists, turns, unexpected moments, visually stunning action sequences and packed full of edge of your seat emotions. All characters get their moments to shine which in its self was incredible but the story that was told really knocked it out of the park. Can't wait for 2019.", "25 Superheros from approximately 18 Marvel Movies is non stop action & entertaining for most all ages. Each of the Characters were well written & perfectly played out. We enjoyed every scene. Highly recommended by myself and family.", "Thought the movie was fun, and entertaining from start to finish. If you go into the movie without a biased approach you will love it for what it is. A fun going cinematic masterpiece, that produces substance, spontaneity, and emotions. The movie had flow and rhythm. From awesome packed fight scenes, to breath taking cinematography, landscapes, and music. This is a movie that will leave you wanting more. Don't listen to the nay-sayers, go into the movie remove any cynicism and you will understand the movie for what its worth. Listen to the words, envision yourself as the characters, there is a humanistic side to everyone including the villains. After all its made by actors, so enjoy it, even if you are a critic.", "A great movie, people love this. The effects are really amazing", "Infinity War is a movie that knocks it out of the ballpark. It's comedic and heartfelt, action and adventure, and it sets up Thanos as a really interesting villain, one who actually loves and cares. In his attempts to get the Soul Stone, when Thanos is required to sacrifice someone he loves, he cries and mourns after he sacrifices Gamora. Most villains are thought of to be cruel and heartless, but Thanos truly believes that what he is doing is right, and he can sway the audience to his side. Was really disappointed to see Rocket as the only Guardian alive at the end of the movie, but I don't think it is really 'the end' for the Avengers turned to ashes. Doctor Strange told Tony that out of all the outcomes, there was one that would involve them winning against Thanos. Before Strange dies, he tells Tony that, \"It had to be done\" hinting that Dr Stange knew this was going to happen and it was why he gave the stone over to save Tony's life, so he could set them on the path of winning. Definitely hyped up for the next one, though fingers crossed it won't be so dark.", "This movie was the best movie I've seen in a while I mean I waited 10 years, it was the greatest ending as it wrapped together every loose end, brought back characters that continued to SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nOk so now that you skipped down to see first I'll say the things that I didn't like as few as they were\n1. I hated how the most powerful of the black order/ thano seas children, Ebony maw who could control things with his mind was killed so easily by being blown out of the whole that iron man blew in the ship they were on.\n2. I hated how much the black order was under used they were there but didn't really affect the plot until the end and then Corvus glave was murdered off so easily.\n3. Not once did captain America and iron man speak to each other and the fact that the government did nothing to stop the invaders or the avengers\n4. I also hated the fact that the sacrifice from vision was completely rendered useless three seconds after it happened\n5. I hated how Wanda was able to destroy the mind stone, I understand that Wanda's powers were created by the mind stone but it an infinity stone for gods sake. Now for the things I liked or loved.\n1. I loved how captain America is still badass and was able to destroy proxima midnight in battle\n2. I like how the hulk was not used as a dues ex machida and allowed for other characters to come in and have a problem to deal with.\n3. I loved how thanos was a total badass and had me feeling for him and hating him all at the same time.\n4. The snap that killed half the universe\n5. The interactions between the guardians and the avengers.\n6. All the people that died turned into dust\n7. Peters saddens and scared actions while he was dying.\n8. That red skull came back and was the holder of the soul stone\n9. The sacrifice of gamora to gain the soul stone \n10. The entire wakanda battle and fight between thanos on titan\n11. The look of titan and it's strangness\n12. Doctor strange and iron mans chemistry \n13. The gauntlet destroyed after the snap.", "I fear that the theater box office might be slow as people who haven't seen the preceding films have to catch up before the film, or people who have only seen some of the films have to go watch the rest before returning for a second viewing.  Minimally one should have seen Ironman 2, all three Thor films, the GotG films, all Captaiin America films, and all the Avengers films along with Doctor Strange and Black Panther. If you these or read the comics it is a film that would be very difficult to follow ( you won't know the collector or why the Reality stone aka the Ether is there, etc.) That said, if you've been all in since 2008 you're golden. And if you haven't read the comic arcs from which much of this is taken (five different books I think), you might be in for a shock. For me, all the speculation especially as it related to the comics and the actors contracts ends up being blown apart and I was relieved and shocked at the same time. PS: The Real Question: In the scene at HQ when they discuss Vision and what to do, in the back on a stand next to Black Widow, is a Rickenbacker. Is it a 620 Fireglo DV247 and is it in homage to Tom Petty? It's not the Pete Townshend 360 and its not a bass. Someone find out which Rick is in the stand in the scene. Oh, and what happens to the Cloak of Levitation - does it 'make it'", "I think everyone had extremely high hopes for this movie, but the realist in me expected it to be a literally impossible feat to coordinate this amount of characters in a cohesive story. I know the result is not perfect and a lot of critics complained about pacing issues, but I genuinely believe that they did the best possible job of juggling all these characters. Even movies like civil war which the Russos pulled off incredibly well pale in comparison to the pure amount of material needed in these 2.5 hours, and it's just an absolute thrill to watch everything together come so well. Of course, everyone's talking about the ending and thanos being great, which I obviously agree with, but I think it's important to remember how impossible of a feat this movie truly was, and I can barely wait for next year's conclusion to this epic story.", "Wow wow wow. Yes. I didn't think they would meet my expectations but they did. I just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but I'm definitely gonna re-watch this entire week. Marvel has knocked it out of the park with not only a legendary film that honestly lives up to its legend but also as the best Avengers film yet.", "This movie. this damn movie. I cannot express how good this was. The acting, the action, the characters, the effects, THE FREAKING ENDING!!!!!!! This movie has done things too me. By far the best Marvel movie. I'm trying not to say too much because u don't want this spoiled, this movie needs to be experienced raw without spoilers. This movie is amazing go see it. \n#ThanosDemandsYourSilence", "Infinity War has had so much hype surrounding it, that I was worried that it would be consumed by its own hype, and having a stereotypical ending. But boy oh boy was I wrong, Infinity War was a fantastic film that absolutely pulled NO punches or kicks. There were drastic consequences, and we'd thought we only saw the last of the deaths once Vision bit the dust, but NOPE! Thanos got all the stones, snapped his fingers, and half the universe died, along with half of the Avengers. It was an extremely sad and shocking moment, yes, but the moment that takes the cake was when Peter Parker / Spider-Man died. I was sobbing like a baby in the theater, as he's always been my favorite, and I never thought for a moment we'd see him die. But he did, and even though we all know it's not a permanent death, it sure as hell is being treated as such.\nThe ending, for all the heartache, was brilliant. Thanos going to watch the sunset he talked about, while smiling, was amazing. And the fact that we got no big overdone title sequence, just somber plain text over sad music, with the title crumbling away at the end. Regardless if it's seen as one of the best, this film will go down in history. And I absolutely loved it.", "The MCU has been giving us solid gold great films for years now, I suppose a slump was inevitable. They've crafted some of the best cinematic origin and world building stories for the smallest and the biggest characters in their franchise and basically left DC in the dust, struggling and scrabbling to make anything that sells as well as The Dark Knight did. For what it's worth, a couple of missteps aside (Guardians Of The Galaxy 2 springs to mind, for all the hype around that I found it to be a horrible disjointed movie that was more shocking than fun like the first one was) I think they've done well, for the most part. It's just that this was a crucial one that brought all those characters together - finally - for an epic showdown against the villain of all villains, Thanos. And for me it just didn't deliver. It was bombastic, wall-to-wall action contrasted with quick and unsatisfying exposition and all the heroes we know so well suddenly reduced to a couple of quips, acting out of character. That is to say, acting like idiots for the most part. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** What worked :-\nThanos has the most coherent story arc. I imagine that's because other than some screen time given to his minions who were looking for the Infinity Stones, he got a lot of the focus. Although his motivation and goal is barbaric, at least you can see WHY he's doing it.\nMost of the action scenes have the usual excellent CGI, although it does drop a bit in some scenes where maybe the animations etc look a bit jerky and unfinished.\nDespite lacking an emotional core for much of the movie, a few of the scenes do have resonance. I keep thinking of poor Peter Parker, who was just a hardworking kid out of his depth. When he faded out of existence it was pretty sad.\nDrax was back to having many of the best comedic lines, just as it was in the first Guardians movie. Dave Bautista has wickedly good timing for his lines and got a laugh out of the whole theatre several times. What failed :-\nAs other less than positive reviews have said, there's just way too much thrown into the pot here. All the heroes are fighting not just to save the universe, but fighting even more desperately for screen time. Many get reduced to just a few lines, which seems like a waste. We're zipping from location to location, fight to fight, and it's all so jarring. I'm reminded of The Hobbit and Star Wars I-III trilogies where eventually your mind switches off and gets exhausted from the excessive amount of detail on screen, to the point where the fight in Wakanda long shots just look like ants fighting bigger ants, there's no real sense of stake so there's no emotional connection or interest either.\nHeroes regularly act stupidly or otherwise out of character. Tony Stark, the usually brilliant strategist, was outdone by Peter Quill who let's be honest is more of a \"fly by the seat of your pants\" kinda guy. Captain America looked like he was having some sort of grunge period, all dark clothes and long beard, none of his usual optimism and passion for fighting the good fight. Bruce Banner now treats The Hulk like some sort of split personality disorder, arguing with himself and having performance anxiety about going green, I assume because whoever wrote the script didn't know how to make the story work if he could just Hulk out when he needed to. The Vision, such a crucial and unexpectedly brilliant addition to the Age Of Ultron story, is rendered a semi-crippled, powerless and emotionally compromised lovesick idiot here. Black Widow is a blonde now, too? It's a small point but worth mentioning.\nDespite all the work that went into that script, there are some real moments where it just comes across as unbelievably dumb. In Wakanda there's such emphasis on making a perimeter at the front just before the shield, then later in the fight they decide to open it anyway to stop being flanked at the back? Come on guys, you have CAPTAIN AMERICA a former soldier who would never have rolled with such a stupid plan.\nWith so much out-and-out action at times the movie just seems to turn into a non-interactive video game. For example, when fighting Thanos on Titan, Dr. Strange creates a series of platforms for Quill to jump across in midair. I'm sorry, I thought his alter-ego was Star-Lord, not Mario. It completely ruins the immersion and sense of disbelief because it's just like when Indy survived a nuclear blast by hiding in a fridge during Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull.\nThe dialogue tries and often fails to match the pop culture quipping that the Joss Whedon written and directed first Avengers movie balanced so perfectly. What seems moderately amusing now will just be dated in ten years. If you're trying to make a timeless movie, these are things to avoid.\nNot only do the heroes often act out of character as they're struggling for screen time, but their power levels don't match with what we've seen in previous MCU movies. To go back to the fight with Thanos on Titan for a moment, it takes a well choreographed effort from Iron Man, Spiderman, Dr. Strange, Star-Lord and Mantis to subdue Thanos for a minute. Not only does Quill then ruin this by being a selfish dick - a problem that several of the heroes have when they keep picking one life over the fate of the universe, let's not forget - but later in the movie, towards the endgame when Thanos has even more Infinity Stones in his gauntlet Scarlet Witch is able to subdue him with one hand while destroying The Vision's Mind Stone with the other. This surely makes her the most powerful hero in the entire cinematic MCU, doesn't it? This was not the case in Age Of Ultron. Worse than this, Thor has also been given some kind of massive strength upgrade as he can now survive the blast of a dying star at close range and only suffer third degree burns, when getting giant Peter Dinklage (what a great idea by the way, one of the few) to make him a shiny new war axe. Surely if Thor is this powerful he should just be able to walk up behind Thanos while he's distracted and rip his arms clean off? Actually maybe if they'd sent Thor and Scarlet Witch at Thanos first of all they could have got the job done and been back in time for dinner.\nAlan Silvestri's amazing Avengers theme, which underpinned some mind-blowing moments in the first two Avengers films, turns up here. But even the magnificence of this doesn't bolster the scenes it is used in, more of a \"oh, there's the theme\" than \"wow, this is such an epic moment made better by how powerful the score is\". It's as good a sign as any that this movie is a bit limp, despite all the gratuitous fight scenes that the younger crowd have trouble seeing through.\nWhen heroes fall it feels inconsequential and disconnected. Whether it be Gamora and Loki or any of the many who wisp away into fertiliser after Thanos completes the gauntlet and commits intergalactic genocide, apart from Peter Parker it feels meaningless. Even the latter is ruined when you see that there will be a Spiderman sequel next year, which rips any semblance of drama right out of the scene. Anyway, the list could go on and on. I feel like I'm taking on the written role of Harry Plinkett from Red Letter Media, by picking this many holes in Infinity War. Granted, some of what I've written could be described as fan boy griping but others are basic failings in the pacing, editing, scripting and cinematography. After an hour the film, for me, was already dragging it's heels. There are some amazing moments in there, but maybe we've been spoiled by the quality of the better previous movies because it can't sustain the momentum and sense of gravitas throughout. It's not a terrible movie, but considering the star power on board etc it could and should have been so much more. As it is, it all comes across as a bit flat, soulless and uninspired. Joss Whedon's incredible efforts with the first Avengers movie have yet to be topped, and from what I've seen from Marvel in the past few years this may never change. 5/10", "Best marvel film so far, can't wait to see it 100000000 more times.", "By the time the credits rolled, I was in tears.

My Rating for the movie is *drum rolls* AWESOMETECULAR = AWESOME + SPECTACULAR (Yeah, It's Stolen..)", "I am speechless. There's in no way I can stop thinking about the film. It's really phenomenal, and is absolutely astonishing in each and every aspect. This is not just another cool summer movie, it's much more than that. AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is a masterpiece of the superhero genre. There's in no way a superhero fan will return home disappointed. Plus, the film is visually so powerful that it needs to be seen in IMAX 3D (I did) for the best experience. After a long time, I saw the multiplex audience cheering and clapping throughout a film, and found even myself doing the same. AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is the pride of world cinema as a whole. It's something you won't have seen or even imagined of seeing, ever before. Much more than just an experience, the film is something which has the power to unite the world with the sole aim of watching and enjoying the film. And I can really see that happening around me. I won't say too much. I don't want to reveal even a single bit of the movie. I'll just say that the performances were excellent, the action scenes were mindblowing, the visual effects were spectacular and the screenplay was masterfully written. This film can go down in the history of filmmaking as (one of) the best superhero film(s) of all time.  Just like any superhero film, this one is also an out and out action entertainer filled with excellent and grand action sequences, but another thing which makes it impactful apart from the action is its plot, character and emotional depth. This is one grand masterpiece that shouldn't be missed at any cost. Each and every second of the film is rewarding, and watching it in the best possible quality is probably the best gift you can give yourself. Don't wait for the DVD or BD. Just go and experience this visual spectacle which is much more than just an experience. This action fantasy movie is, the best superhero film of all time.", "I expected this movie to be amazing, and I am glad to say that it somehow EXCEEDED that expectation by a long shot. The balancing between all of the different groups of characters was perfect. I never felt like one group had too much or too little on screen, it's just how Thanos would like it; balanced. Thanos is by far the greatest villain in any superhero movie. He had so much screen time that one could argue it was less about the Avengers and more about Thanos and his journey to destroy half of the Universe. Thanos as a character just had so much depth and character development in this film, which isn't very common in films as most of them only tell us \"they are the evil asshole trying to kill everyone\" and that's it. In this, we get many scenes with him that explain his motivations and his perspective, which really felt like a new thing to me. Moving on, there was not single scene in this film where I felt like the pacing was off, and no scene where I felt bored. The film hooks you in from the very start until the end. The humour in this film is exactly the same as what you would expect from a Guardians of The Galaxy film. When Iron Man called one of The Children of Thanos \"Squidward\" the entire crowd burst into laughter and nobody could stop. It was simply amazing. There is not really any characters that I disliked in this movie which I found incredible considering there is something like 80 characters in this film. If I had to pick, it would have to be maybe Black Widow and Mantis since they really didn't contribute all that much. Speaking of, basically all characters (with a few exceptions) contributed a fair part to the overall plot, which again is hard when you are juggling 80 characters at once. The ending was completely unexpected to say the least. Thanos succeeds in killing half of all life in the Universe, killing characters such as Spiderman, Dr Strange, Black Panther, Nick Fury, and so many more. I know for a fact that they will come back, but despite that, I am very intrigued to see how this all plays out and how they will bring at least some of these characters back. Overall, this movie was everything it needed to be. Congratulations to the directors for making a truly awesome film experience.", "This truly Blew me away, I honestly expected to be disappointed but... that couldn't be further from the truth. The direction that they took was so well executed. I will need to see it again and again. I truly love this movie!", "It movie is really good. Its graphics are really unexpectedly great. I never so any movie like that , I saw in IMAX and that experience is really good.", "This movie is absolutely marvelous ! from the beginning to end, full on mind blowing actions ,hilarious scenes And funny dialogues .Fast paced ; Highly engaging screenplay ; a lot of superheros in this movie! all are right fit ,everybody got their wonderful moments ! Stunning cinematography , great background score work . AND well talented perfect direction to this gigantic film ! \nINFINITY WAR IS OUTSTANDING ,EMOTIONAL, SHOCKING AND SPECTACULAR BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT MY RATING -9.8 OUT OF 10 !!!", "A little bit different with trailers. All characters performed well", "Avengers Infinity War is the definition of mania. Everything just finally unravels on screen and it certainly messes with your mentality if you've been sticking around with this franchise for the past ten years. I'm more than pleased with this exhilarating MCU flick. (Verdict: A-)", "Except for Avengers: Infinity War.  Man, this is difficult to do without spoilers...so I will describe my movie going experience instead. The best and funniest moments that had the theatre laughing out loud were, of course, the interactions between Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. There was a woman sitting behind me who started crying towards the end of the movie while there were more restrained but audible gasps of shock from the rest of us. The last 10 minutes of the movie had the entire theatre silent, as in a pin could've dropped and you would've heard it. None of us left before the end credits scene which is when we were all excitedly discussing what we had just watched. After the end credits scene, the theatre, where we as proud Brits are usually loathe to show any emotion in typical British stiff upper lip style, erupted in clapping. The attention to detail and the pace held my attention from start to finish and I am so excited for the next installment. Yes, there were a few things I didn't like about the movie but detailing them would place us in spoiler territory and this movie needs to be seen spoiler free. So, if you've not seen it yet, please avoid the internet until you do.", "I have been a fan of the Marvel movies since the beginning, but I was a fan of Marvel long before that. Through the comic books and the cartoon series, I have grown to love this world and the characters that inhabit it, and the MCU movies truly brought them to life, they allowed them to be in the real world. This instalment of their adventures was showing all their hens coming to roost - there were jokes of course, but it was deadly serious from the very beginning. Every character knew the stakes were high and by the end of it, the silence by which the characters expired thickened this seriousness. I was brought to the verge of tears, holding them back only because I was in public, because for all intents and purposes my friends are dead. \nThis is a brilliant film and merges all the light-heartedness that the MCU is known for with the true grit and realism of the Netflix shows, despite the aliens and flashy lights.\nThanos is given a much more grounded reason for his tirade and this makes him one of the more menacing and powerful villains ever seen. \nI truly cannot wait for the next film in the MCU and the next Avengers film.\nWell done to you all for this.", "Marvel's latest-and largest-production is far from perfect, but it melds its many, many elements into an impressive mix of humor and sorrow.", "The best MCU film out of them all. Still can't believe the writers and producers had the stones to pull off the ending. Already seen it twice and will go again.", "The film was fantastic,epic ,amazing! I can't describe more.can't wait to avengers infinity war part II!", "Must have paid so many people to write good reviews on this one. Pure and utter garbage!!!!", "Marvel's been at this so long that their success is no longer a surprise. They aren't just a part of Disney film making, they're a benchmark in big budget entertainment. So, expectations for the new Avengers installment were sky high. We've had smash hit after smash hit from the studio and I'm happy to report that they've got another winner. One reason for this is that Infinity War maintains the delicate balance of keep things light while keeping the stakes raised. There were more than a few times that the entire audience burst out laughing but with the added threat of Thanos (Josh Brolin), the threat he poses to the world is grave and you feel that tension. This is compounded by the fact that this doesn't follow a template, they take things on new tangents and although I was able to guess a few things, Infinity War never fell into a rut or felt too familiar. Much like the Russo's previous work for Marvel (CA: The Winter Soldier and CA: Civil War) they somehow give everyone enough time to show what they can do, even with such a large ensemble. I was able to spend enough time with each major character to find out their motivation and how they planned to deal with the looming threat. They also split into smaller groups and they had such great chemistry together that there wasn't a stale moment. Everyone is humanized, and no one is just defined by their special abilities. This even includes the villains which is no mean feat. We see new sides of some of the characters, background players get some time in the spotlight and although these heroes boast superhuman abilites, we learn just how vulnerable they are in their moments of weakness.  You don't get much bigger than the names in this cast. That sounds hyperbolic, but you have to remember just how many people have been collecting checks as heroes or villains in this universe. There are too many members in the cast to go through 1 by 1 but I did have a couple of favourites. Chris Hemsworth builds off his strong performance in Thor: Ragnarok, Robert Downey Jr. was his typically excellent self and it was nice that Elizabeth Olsen got more to do as Scarlet Witch. Some of the relatively new cast members like Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman were also exceptional. I also really liked Josh Brolin as Thanos, he's a worthwhile villain for our heroes and there was a lot of feeling in his performance despite it being performance capture.  With a movie housing so many wild and memorable characters with their own independent style and motivations, there was bound to be a couple of missteps. The biggest for me was Gamora's subplot with Thanos. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of important work here where we see another side to Thanos that isn't a bloodthirsty lunatic. It makes him a more memorable Marvel antagonist instead of him just fading into the crowd. But Gamora loses strength as a character by how easily she bends to Thanos and it dampened parts of the story for me. They also make Dr. Strange even more arrogant and there were moments where his act was wearing a little thin. The movie doesn't completely skate around plot holes but none of them are egregious enough to wreck the movie. The other small issue is that there is so much buildup and hype for Infinity War that it was almost impossible to live up to that ideal. The last thing I want to mention is that I want to credit the creative team for doing something bold with the ending. It would have been easy to just setup a sequel and slide into a happy ending but that's not the direction they chose to go with. They really caught me off guard and I think most people will have a similar reaction. It makes me just that more intrigued about where they will choose to go next (we know there's going to be another Avengers movie, that's not a spoiler). Anyone who's been attending the local cineplex in the summer over the past 5-10 years has a passing familiarity with Iron Man, Captain America and the Marvel characters. The fans expected a lot and this movie delivered. Almost every character had their time to shine, the movie balances the action and the humour superbly and they tell a story that does all the buildup justice. They also take it a way that will open things up and stray from predictably just marketing for the next standalone. Keep your eyes open for some Easter eggs and a couple of surprise appearances. If you're a Marvel fan, I'd recommend this wholeheartedly but let's face it, you were going to go see it anyway.", "I am a person who has never read the comics, but has fallen in love with the films. And it has to be said with this particular universe, all of the filmmakers have transformed what were either unlikable or one dimensional heroes and villains into fully fledged, lovable, three dimensional characters. They make you care for these people - which is why this film works extraordinarily well. This movie is many things: extremely relentless, fast-paced, funny, heartbreaking and action packed. And contains one of the most jaw-dropping endings I've ever seen. When a mass-market appeal blockbuster is totally invested in consequences, storylines and character arcs, as well as taking big risks, I absolutely love it and wish more movies had the balls to do it.  That being said, there is a small part of me that wished I wasn't so geeked out and in love with the characters. But it's too late, as Doctor Strange says at one point, \"We are in the endgame, now.\" The filmmakers did right, they didn't joke about and they meant it when people should not spoil the movie.  Go and see it.", "It's a blast when a film not only meets expectations, but exceeds them. This uses the whole toolkit that the Marvel films have accumulated over the years, and finds exactly the right mix of familiar and new, humor and drama. It's like a runaway freight train but it knows that and does nothing to take away from the rush of being on board. Great stuff. As far as specifics, the new combinations of characters are a joy, it's confident and intrepid visually and the rationale of why the villain is doing what he does comes across better than one would expect. There are a couple of scenes that seem contrived to push a lever for the story, but in such a grand scheme, hardly worth mentioning. This is far better than Age of Ultron, a real return to form for the Avengers.", "My concerns about the balance and cohesion between the cast and the settings prior to seeing the movie were real. Infinity War is four distinct movies stitched together. The different groups do not interact, let alone coordinate with each other, and the conflict should not be called a war but a series of amazing stories. Each scene change requires the audience to not only readjust their mood and expectation, but also the level of engagement. The films jumps back and forth between melodramas, epic fighting and irrelevant humors which feel awkward and disjoint. While viewers should not expect physical realism or common sense in a comic-book movie, some is still required to convince us to suspend our disbelieve. The best part of Infinity War is the mighty Thanos himself, who bears the brunt of narrative depth and character development. He seems to be such a nice guy, who tried his damnest to not hurt our fragile heroes, and a diligent achiever that I wish I could buy him a beer and watch the sunset together. The semi-destruction of the universe is a hard day's work after all. Mission accomplished.", "So dissapointed, a movie that take too long doesnt bring any brilliant job,with the same absurd and cringe comedy comes again with a cliffhanger not likeable.", "Going into this movie, I was a little worried it would be underwhelming. This movie delivered! it was action-packed from start to finish. A couple of things that bothered me a tiny bit were the cgi with the black order and the slightly underdeveloped relationship between Thanos and Gamora. Concerning the relationship between Thanos and Gamora, it's hard to cultivate a strong relationship in a movie that has so many other plots to accomplish (so it's easy to understand/forgive).  Aside from these minor flaws, the rest of the movie is awesome. The jokes were funny and not forced, the new suits and weapons were unbelievable, and there was a lot of tragedy! I'm glad Marvel was not afraid to get their hands dirty with deaths. Thanos is a formidable force, and he was portrayed as such.", "Wow. I don't usually do movie reviews but this has got to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I have never been through so many emotions in a short span of time. Everything about this movie is Phenomenal.The soundtrack, the visual effects, the acting, the menacing characteristics of Thanos, EVERYTHING. I entered the movie with high hopes, and was not disappointed. I laughed, I cried, and I was drawn in by the action scenes. This movie entailed everything that a good movie possesses. I will be seeing it again. Do not waste your time, and GO TO THIS MOVIE. I didn't know it was possible, but now I am even more in love with the MCU.", "I've been waiting for this film since 2008 when Nick Fury showed up in Tony Stark's house telling him he's apart of a bigger universe and he just doesn't know it.  The pacing is relentless. Not a boring moment. It was basically three third acts all together. I was surprised to see it even escalate further than I expected. Being a huge comic-book geek, I was pleased to see the film go to places where I thought it wouldn't. I definitely thought Marvel would play it just a little safe before Avengers 4, but they didn't.  So with that being said, lets start with Thanos. Josh Brolin's Thanos is the MCU's best villain by far, beating out Loki, Winter Soldier, Vulture, Killmonger, and Zemo. Also for a CGI creature, he looked legit. Unlike Steppenwolf, the way the light hits his face, the subtle movements on his face when he expresses himself, his movement, it was just perfection. There are some moments where it's not too polished, but it's not completely distracting. Compared to the comics, the Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take some liberties to make Thanos more than just a big villain who wants to destroy the world. In his own sick and twisted point of view, he kinda had a point, and the best villains are the ones who think that they're doing the right thing.  At this point if any of you have been following the MCU or at least watched a good portion, you won't be totally lost. The entire cast brought their A-game and came to play. Some characters take a back seat, but they do get their moment to shine and are used very well in service of the plot. Downey Jr. and Cumberbatch have great snarky, prick-like, know-it-all vs. know-it-all back and forth. Holland, Pratt, Bautista, Mackie, Cooper, Diesel, and Ruffalo bring some levity. Evans and Hemsworth bring it in the action department and at this point they can play Cap and Thor in their sleep. We also get a nice cameo from a character we haven't seen in a while. You'll know who I'm talking about once you see the film.  Kudos for Markus and McFeely for juggling this behemoth. One can make the argument that it can get confusing, but if you're invested as much as I am, then it's a total breeze. With 18 movies in, Infinity War can't afford to bring you up to speed.  I normally find romance in superhero films a drag, but here Infinity War juggles two of them and they work really well. I found that the Vision and Scarlet Witch romance was quite effective. Star-Lord and Gamora worked well also.  Action sequences and special effects are top notch. I know a lot of VFX artists worked day and night and they really did not miss a beat. Like Thanos, some weren't as polished, but it's not to the point where it's so obvious. The battle sequences in Titan and Wakanda are back to back edge of your seat thrill rides. I particularly geeked out in the Titan sequence where Thanos does have a one on one with Doctor Strange and Iron Man. Kudos for the creative team to allow Thanos to go nuts with his Infinity Gauntlet. That was such a treat.  Thanos solves Marvel's villain problem. He got a lot of screen time to be developed and being a fan I wasn't disappointed. I love that I felt a sense of danger. As much as I love the MCU, the criticism of no stakes and weak villains for some of their films are valid. For the first time in a while, we actually feel fear for these characters and it's awesome.  If I had one negative, and that's really all I have, is that perhaps the Black Order, or the Children of Thanos are nothing more than just henchmen. They are primarily new characters introduced in the Infinity storyline back in 2013. I did not expect to get what writer Jonathan Hickman gave us in the source material they're based off of, so I kept my expectations in check, but I really did think we'd get a little more to who they are all about. Out of the four, only Ebony Maw truly impressed me and had the most to do.  Avengers: Infinity War is everything I could have hoped for. It's definitely in my Top 3 list of MCU films, and in my Top 10 comic-book films of all time. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and directors Joe & Anthony Russo did not pull any punches with this one. It pulled my heart out, making some bold choices along the way. I love their tone as they bring intensity, knowing when to be serious and knowing when to sprinkle in a little humor here and there.  It's a grim and bleak time for the Avengers and the Guardians. The sense of danger makes all the difference in this film. If any of you haven't seen it, you're all not ready for what's to come. Consequences are real and the stakes are high. I will definitely be seeing this again in theaters and I'm so thankful that Avengers 4 is only a year wait as opposed to two or three.  Remember to also stay after the credits.  9.5/10", "I had hope and moderate expectations for this film, Esp after seeing the heart of gold Black Panther film a couple months back and Thor Ragnorak was pretty decent. \nBoth far more original than any avengers film in previous years, Went went my two teen sons to a packed house. The final is a grade F of any cinemascore \nLoud Boos all around. Horrible Mess is putting nicely. Avengers franchise flicks will not see one more red cent whether it is a movie ticket to a dvd rental. Done Finished finito! Not sure if its the fan boys being paid to write these reviews. Or its a global Russian hacking gig, But in no way could this rubbish heap garner that much praise without the studios lining pockets. But Mark my words once the word gets out and believe ya cant hide it like a tinder match thrown in a dry as bone woods. the fire will catch and grow in a blazing forestfire. And you the movie going public deserve so much more for your hard earned cash. F-", "Depressing? Check. Zero plot? Check. Do I want to use my free time to enjoy a depressing movie as a form of entertainment? No. I can sum up this movie in a few lines: 1)We are getting the band back together. 2)CGI mess 3)No twist, nothing special. Very linear.  4)Every one of your heros just suck not using their main strengths 5)Make every hero stupid and fail. 6)Over dramatized for not caring about the heros because they are that dumb. Pretty much just hand over the stones and die. Thanks for the multi billion dollars for this poor developed story and movie.  Anyone that tells you, \"it's good\" is for sure lying and just hyping it just what the business wants. Seriously, not good. I've seen all the Marvel movies and this one is just action follow by drama garbage. Can you guys just make another 'Winter solider' movie? I really don't mind waiting a over a year for the next one to rent it on Netflix with the dribble I just saw. I gave it a one because I just felt like I saw nothingness and stupidity at it's finest. The end.", "The movie starts with a really extraordinary beginning. Then it gets weirder and gets fast and you get really exhausted to keep track of everything that is going on.  The ending was predictable and heartbreaking but then again, you know that it all will be good in the end at avengers 4", "All my favourites died if they don't come back in the next one I will never watch another marvel movie again so help me god", "Boring movie, few good bits but not coherent and cohesive. needed more dialogue and conversations. Needed to take its time. Too jam packed. I liked thor and hulk in the thor 3 movie. I liked Ant man 1. I liked Iron man 1,2,3. The good part in infinity war - thor was good. thanos was ok. wong was good. dr strange was good. bruce was good.", "I wasn't a Marvel fan until I watched The Avengers in 2012. I had seen tidbits of Iron Man and Iron Man 2, I had watched Thor in the movie theaters, and I hadn't seen Captain America: The First Avenger but these films, while they were enjoyable to a certain extent, didn't make me incredibly happy. The Avengers did. At that time there had never been a superhero ensemble like it before and it was positively incredible. Jump forward six years later and Avengers: Infinity War has completely wowed me like The Avengers once did. This movie isn't just spectacular because it's got nearly two dozen heroes in it but because Thanos was the villain worth waiting for. He arrives, gets an Infinity Gauntlet sized grip on your emotions and your fears for the heroes, and doesn't let go until the end of the movie. I walked away from this film completely stunned and I mean that in the best way possible. Marvel has created a superhero film that's going to be extremely hard to replicate in any way, shape, or form in the future for other superhero flicks and I just couldn't be happier with the experience I had. Now I watched this film twice and the only reason why I don't have it as a solid 10 out of 10 is because the movie is VERY long. When you watch the film the first time the story is so compelling you don't even notice the two hour and thirty-two minute run time but after the second time I watched it felt like I had seen a really epic superhero marathon. That doesn't make the movie bad. It just isn't a movie I can rewatch over and over again like some of the other Marvel films (Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor: Ragnarok) and that is it its only fault. It's definitely one of my favorite superhero movies of all time though and I highly recommend you see it before it leaves theaters.", "I can't think of a movie experience as gratifying as this one. This movie was a complete universe in the making, an experiment that had every possibility of going wrong... but it... did... not! The whole movie lasts about two and a half hours but you can barely feel it, the mere spectacle is so full of surprises mixed with a healthy dose of humor. Infinity War feels like an intergalactic battle with the higher stakes as The Avengers and their allies fight the biggest threat they will ever face, a god-like Mad Titan by the name of Thanos. Every single film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe feels like a necessary piece of the puzzle as many of the questions we thought were forgotten will get a resolution. The Russo Brothers did the best they possibly could and it feels almost as a reward of all our loyalty, this is the movie we deserved... and they gave it to us. This was probably the best Comic Book adaptation of All-Time.", "Good action scenes, probably some of the best I have ever seen. A lot of time was spent on the Guardians of the Galaxy. A lot of the dialogue is about \" were better superhero's than you \" which become a bit repetitive. There are different groups of superheros and some of the match ups didn't fit well. Scarlet johanssen looks older. The hulk has a problem that runs through the whole movie and is never resolved. I liked the twist at the end. Thanos in parts stops being bad and it upset the flow of the movie, just be pure evil for gods sake. Also the word infinity stones is used way to much. At one point I was expecting Kevin Bacon to pop out but it didn't happen. I wish we could have seen more of the collector and his flambouyent character. Get ready for a sequal for sure.", "No spoilers. From the first second to the very last, you will be on edge. Anticipating, scared, laughing, crying, excited. \nCredit to the writers, directors, actors, every single person who has worked on this film and every Marvel film before it. You have built a world that is simply incredible. And Thanos? Well, he demands your silence.", "Spoiler free\nSimply EPIC!!!\nI hardly write any reviews, I read them. I felt compelled to write a review for this movie. I'm still processing what I've seen and I can tell you one thing, the hype paid off, big time.\nI'm really an MCU-fan and have watched every movie prior this one and all these movies accumulate in this one. The cast, the acting, the cgi, it's all top notch. Thanos really is bada** and I think together with Hela, the best villain I've ever seen.\nThis movie gave me all the emotions from thrilled, sad, hope and awe. I'm going to watch this 150-minute movie again really soon, there is so much in it that can't be seen in one go. If you like MCU, this is the mother of it all. You'll most definitely like this one. Can't believe when I say that I'm looking forward to the sequel. Best movie in ages, a job very well done!", "1. I think this plot was really uncreative, especially compared to Civil War or Winter Soldier... or really any other recent Marvel movie. I ADMIT its amazing to see ALL these superheroes together, I enjoyed their dialogue, and the simultaneous battles were cool, but its wasted on a pointless, lazy plot. Bad guy gonna kill (50% of) everyone. Wow.\n2. Why does Thanos care anyway? How does killing 50% of the universe make him feel any better about the fall of his own planet/society? Even Loki's pettiest motives were more solid than Thanos'. Also, why did he \"love\" his \"adopted\" (abducted) daughter more than his blood daughter?\n3. This is colonial-imperialist propaganda. Usually Marvel films seem to me critical of the military-industrial complex. But this film promotes the idea that because of the failings of ONE LIFESTYLE - mass industrial society - all forms of life are unsustainable. Not everyone lives like a spoiled American/ect.

It has so many unforgettable moments that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer. And it's the darkest Marvel film yet. Maybe even the darkest superhero film yet. And it doesn't try too hard to be dark and edgy like the DC films. What makes the Marvel films so great is how relatable and human the superheroes are, and the sacrifices they make to save their fellow people.

Unbelievable movie, the last years of Marvel movies had a goal... this movie.", "Not sure why people are on the down side with some reasons that make no sense but film is subjective.\nI have seen this movie 3 times twice in Dolby ATMOS and once in IMAX... Loved it. I could feel the tension the first viewing and was not sure what to grade it honestly. After 3nd viewing I enjoyed it even more. The culmination of 10 years showed up on this screen. It is a singular movie no matter what anyone says.\nThere is a beginning a middle and an end. The fact a villain won this time probably will not sit well with people.. I was hoping for a SNAP and screen go black to credits back when I heard of this movie being filmed (I came close).\nNext year's Avengers movie will do what previous movies did... be connected but NOT A SEQUEL. i honestly think we may be getting some Skrulls involved as well.\nThanos was great... Loved the Brolin performance and loved how threatening he was.\nI plan on seeing this again as I use Sinemia card for 3 movies a month. The fact someone put up a review with nothing to describe the film except they were going home to watch \"the Wolverine\" (bad movie IMO...Watch LOGAN instead) is insane... but being subjective I guess that is people's prerogative. Just don't hate to hate and be a toxic fan. It is definitely unbecoming for people to be that way. FYI I would actually give this a 9.5 in my eyes but we cant rate 9.5 so a 10 is rounded up.. my favorite marvel film is still Captain America the Winter Soldier. ENJOY THIS", "The MCU has been my favorite since I watched the first Captain America in elementary school. Every single film felt like it was leading to something bigger, and this was it and it delivered better than I ever could have imagined. Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus once again do a fantastic job with the screen play. I was amazed at how well they were able to balance every single character. Most characters don't have more than 10 minutes of screen time but everyone has a moment to shine, their presence feels much bigger. I really think credit is deserved for Thanos, everything about him. Josh Brolin does fantastic in this role; he is the best villain in a superhero film since the 2008 Joker. The CGI on him was also flawless. The visual and sound effects were superb in general. I was a bit worried about that after Black Panther which had mediocre CG, but this film looked excellent. This movie is paced in a way that provides exciting action throughout and offers a chance for the big characters to have deep moments, particularly with Star-Lord. If you haven't seen this, you need to, it is nothing short of spectacular.", "There is a lot of negative reviews here and I don't understand why, the movie is what it is entertainment and a lot of actions and that is exactly what I expected,,when I go see a movie of this type I am not expecting a academy award performance but instead a great action movie and that is exactly what I got !", "It was a pretty good movie. I just saw it the other day, and I thought that it was pretty good! I almost cried 3 times, when Gamora dies, when Spider-Man dies, and something else I can't remember. The most I cried was when Spider-Man dies. He's just so innocent and I shed so many tears. Apart from the sad parts, it was a pretty good movie! The only reason this has 8 stars instead of 10 is because I cannot keep up with all of the Marvel movies that you are spewing out every month or so. I didn't know most of the superhero's in the movie, because I don't have much time in my day to watch the other movies. But, overall it was pretty good. Another good thing is that the villain won, and you don't usually see that in movies. I like the uniqueness! Okay, this next paragraph is a HUGE spoiler for the next infinity war. Read at your own risk Okay, thank you for letting everyone come back to life in the next movie! I checked the cast for the next movie, and thank I for not killing off my baby Starlord and Spider-Man!

Also if you don't like super heros at all or if your very old you might not like this movie other wise you will love it just keep an open mind and try to blend in.", "Avengers infinity war is a must see for any marvel fan like myself seeing our greatest heroes come together like the guardians of the galaxy, spider man and many more but the highlight of the movie is Josh Brolins thanos easily the best baddie since darth Vader. I cant stress it enough just see it for yourself", "I gotta say I wasn't expecting this movie to be so good, but when I was in the theater watching the movie it had me on the edge of my seat. I didn't even worry about what time it was because I was so into the movie. I highly recommend this movie for all the Marvel fans .", "Marvel have proven time and time again that they know what the fans want and they know what the fans need and this time they not only pulled off such an audacious film but perhaps the most star and risk filled film to date.  With such a ride from start to finish, a perfect balance between action and narrative story telling, Infinity War knows when to suck you in, pull back a little and then knock you down begging for more.", "Amidst all the hype and all the expectations, considering that the last few MCU movies were good/decent, and considering that this it the culmination of 10 years of MCU movies, there are no words in this Universe that can describe just how powerful this movie really is. At this moment, without any hesitation or doubt, especially considering my reservations in the light of Civil war, I can honestly say this is the best superhero/comic book movie ever made. I actually had to go back into the theater the day after I first saw the movie because of the shock it put me in. I honestly could not write a, sine ira et studio review. Watching it a second time around got me even more emotionally struck and left me in even more awe. Sincerely, after 10 years of playing certain characters (some more or less), there really isn't much that one should say about the acting abilities of Downey Jr. or Cumberbatch or Pratt etc. They are all, primarily fantastic actors but they have such a degree of understanding their characters that at some point they reall are not even acting (especially noticeable in Downey Jr.'s case). Still, certain members managed to surprise even after all this time: Evans' take on the Cap this time was SUPERB, FLAWLESS, SPECTACULAR. His moral superiority and all those little characteristics that made him who he is are now so base and so minor in comparison to his charisma and dominance of the entire rogue Avengers team. His presence (even though short) i overwhelming at the least. But, the one that stole every scene was Hemsworth. All of the humor of the catastrophic Ragnarok is still there, but it feels much more in place. Thor was the one that suffered a lot (maybe the most) and Hemsworth does an amazing job portraying it. Everyone else did a splendid job, up to the task, used every second of the scenes they were in (because not much time was given to some of them). But regardless, the acting and characters never feel overstuffed (unlike Civil war). But the one we should be talking about is Brolin. In all my time watching comic book movies never have I seen a villain (or is he?) with such depth and emotions, with such philosophy behind his actions. Even though he is fully CGI the way Brolin portrayed him is astonishing. At a point one can even consider the possibility this movie was not about the Avengers, but about him. He took most of the screen time and was the driving force behind the whole story. But the things that make him a character like never before seen in an MCU movie are his Greek-tragedy-style decisions and final confrontation with himself. These scenes show that MCU movies can have depth, meaning, that they can be tragic and meaningful. He was worth the wait. The story itself is not too complex. As I said, more of the movie is based on Thanos than on the Avengers, and in the end that actually is not a bad thing. We are all a bit fed up with them and their personal stories so this one, focusing on something completely different was a superb idea, MARVELously executed. Also, regarding the story, the movie itself was nicely edited, with not to many abrupt jumps from one scene to the other (with a few forgettable exceptions). But the highlight is the simultaneous final battle taking place on multiple locations. But all that would be nothing new if it were not for the scale of the battles themselves. The Earth battle is a classic final showdown - epic, large in scale, violent etc. The fistfight with Thanos is, on the other hand, almost identically grave and menacing as the army battle on Earth. That is not easily accomplished and high regards must be given to the directors and screenwriters. Last but not least, the music. If today we are to choose the greatest composers of our time, Silvestri is to be one of them. The way his notes strike into the very heart of the viewers is superb, and his solo piano rendition of the Avengers theme fits so perfectly with the end credits that one feels the entire movie all over again by just listening to his music. But the one thing that hits harder than anything else is his ending/Thanos theme. The contrast between the magnitude of what he has just done, and the calmness and simplicity of his theme is utmost perfection. Even if I tried (and God help me I tried), I could not find a single flaw to this movie. This is the movie Civil war warned us about. This is the movie the DC movies try to be, and fail in their effort spectacularly. This is what a culmination of 10 years of work in the MCU looks like. This is the definitive comic book movie. This is something like nothing else in the world exists today. Infinity war is the best movie od 2018. (and I say that in April). Infinity war is one of the greatest movies ever made. P.s. viewers that have not seen all of the previous 18 movies might have a problem with understanding certain segments or feeling the same way as those who have. So, if you haven't seen all of them, sit down and get to work before you consider watching this Titan of a movie. Avengers...", "I wouldn't expect, or recommend anyone to see this movie as their first introduction to this super hero universe. So, going forward with the premise that you have seen most of the previous Avenger movies, you should enjoy this one. To be clear, I did. Heck I gave it 8 stars out of 10. Now, my 8 stars is in real world a 7+, but that's not an option, so 8.\nThe movie does a real nice job of shoe horning all the different characters into it, without feeling like each characters scene was gratuitous. There is a nice amount of comedy, but not an over the top amount, like was in Thor Ragnarok. \nThe Thanos character C.G.I. looks pretty good! His league of minions are typical bad guy cannon fodder. \nThe numerous deaths of the super heroes in the movie is kinda sorta false b.s. though. We all know most, if not all of these passings will not take. Heck, it's all but spelled out what will happen, at least in a general sense, the next film so that all the deaths can be erased. So, anyone leaving the theater wiping their wet eyes on their shirt sleeves, buck up. Tony Stark and the remaining sup's will make short order of Thanos and bring all your favorite characters back soon. Just in time too, as I have no doubt that the studio will want another huge payday!", "Went in seeing the high ratings, but didn't put too much credence in that because Black Panther got 9+ reviews and I thought it was mediocre at best.  I want to keep this review simple so that people who have not seen the film will not get any spoilers.  This film is not perfect, but it did a very nice job of blending so many characters and giving each one a moment in the lead. Plus the script was pretty good, with some laugh out loud moments.  Thanos is by far one of the best villains in the MCU. He expresses himself well, you get to know his history and actually shows some feelings. Not many films do that very well.  Bottom line - if you liked the first Ironman, the first Guardians, Avengers, and Thor: Ragnarok, then you will like this film. I would recommend that you need to have seen many of the previous MCU films to get a good sense of the interactions between the characters.  This is the pure definition of a great popcorn movie. Not an Oscar winning film for acting, but it is immensely entertaining.", "Epic and awnsome movie, can't wait to watch avengers 4", "It was very good. I really enjoyed it. Honestly, I don't have much to say. I just want the IMDB fan rating to be high because the movie is worth seeing and certainly worth being on the top 10 list. Hopefully this will sustain!", "I'll try not to spoil anything, but let me say that this is by far the best marvel film, if not just the best film, I have ever seen!  The story was great, the acting was great. You could see everyone's emotions just by looking into their eyes. I will say, you need to be prepared for some extremely emotional sections, especially the ending.  I'll also say that there is only ONE post credit scene. It comes after the long credits, so be sure to wait through the whole thing! This was an AMAZING film. Go see it now!", "I'd taken a break from seeing Marvel movies at the theatre, since last year's offerings didn't appeal to me, but having enjoyed some of the previous solo movies and half-enjoying the previous two Avengers movies, I thought I should give Infinity War a go for the characters who I *did* care about, knowing full-well that time would also be spent on characters I didn't care about. We begin with Thor, Loki and the film's big bad, Thanos. It feels like Thor's gotten more screentime here than he did in the previous Avengers movies. Surprisingly, his main interaction is with Rocket from the Guardians of the Galaxy, who he calls \"Rabbit\". Like in Age of Ultron, Thor shows up towards the film's end, seemingly with a way of defeating the villain...but that doesn't quite work out this time. I enjoyed Thor's first movie, but am disappointed with what they've reduced him/his movies to. Tony is...Tony. If you still like him by this point, chances are you're never going to *dislike* him (no matter what he says/does), but as someone who's never been a fan of RDJ's mumbled-speed-talking a-hole of a character, I just mostly tune out when he's eating up screentime/cracking \"jokes\". The brief scene spent with RDJ and Paltrow just made me wish they'd spent the screentime on something/anything else. His relationship he's developed with Tom Holland's Spider-Kid will probably tug at the heartstrings of people (especially near the end, where Peter reminded me of the Tenth Doctor's exit from Doctor Who), but I personally find the kid's whole \"Mr. Stark\"/referencing \"really old movies\" shtick tiresome. Mark Ruffalo's acting early on (when he's describing the severity of the situation to everyone) feels off, Hulk doesn't show his green face again after losing a fight to Thanos in the opening scene and Banner looks ridiculous with his head poking up out of the Hulkbuster armour at the end during what is supposed to be a very emotional/serious scene. Haters of his 'relationship' with Scarlett Johansson's Natasha (sporting a new blonde hairdo for some reason) probably won't appreciate the all-too-brief acknowledgment of their past when they meet up...but *I* appreciated it. A now-bearded Steve Rogers/Captain America seems to have less screentime here than he did previously (despite the fact that he should've been owed *more* screentime after his third solo film was hijacked by Tony and friends) and has suffered a similar fate to Thor for me. Most of what I once enjoyed about Steve's character in his first solo film has been stripped away...though he's still more likable than Tony and I'm still on Steve's side. He shares a hug/brief exchanges with Bucky, but that's about it. I was disappointed that the 'brother-like' relationship Steve was developing in Civil War with Wanda was dropped here (as was her other 'brother-like' figure, Hawkeye, entirely). The other Stephen, Doctor Strange, is Tony's new verbal sparring partner, as they immediately clash (thanks to Tony's inability to go without snarking/insulting others for even a minute). I wish Strange's Cloak of Levitation would've beaten the snot out of Tony instead of just giving him a slap when he disrespected an ancient artifact. Nevertheless, that cloak is still awesome. Not so awesome? The GotG. I'm not a fan of their characters, their movies or their brand of 'humour' (I think John C. Reilly's character summed them up best in their first film: \"What a bunch of a-holes.\"). The only one I half-like (Karen Gillan's Nebula) is sadly wasted. She's tortured, then awesome, then gives Star-Lord some upsetting information which causes him to muck up their one real chance they have at defeating Thanos. Not fun when someone lets their PERSONAL FEELINGS get the better of them IS IT, TONY? While others probably don't appreciate the characters of Wanda/Scarlet Witch and Vision, or the actors' performances, I've always liked Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany in the roles and their characters' relationship. I thought they made the most of their screentime/what they're given and enjoyed the time we spent with them (especially when Wanda started to kick major butt. Plus, despite her feelings for Vision, she ultimately does what needs to be done...though she's robbed of that sacrifice). As I expected, they're given short shrift and it feels like nobody really cares about them. Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther hasn't much to do. Danai Gurira's Okoye makes more of an impression (I liked/appreciated the scene where she and Natasha helped Wanda. Too bad the film's ending means we won't get to continue seeing them be awesome together). Other characters get moments here and there, but Thanos takes up a large percentage of the film. Josh Brolin's given more material to work with than the last few Marvel villains I've seen, but personally I would've rather spent more time with the Avengers, as I didn't feel for Thanos no matter how often he looked sad/cried, since he wanted to kill half the universe's population.  Some of the action is hard to follow, the film cuts back and forth between many different characters/plots and the cliff-hanger ending elicited a \"WTF?\" reaction from the audience I was with. This film was never going to please everyone. There'll be those unfairly critical of it, but also those overpraising it. I enjoyed parts of it. Other parts? Not so much. The problem with trying to cram so much together was that certain characters felt shortchanged. Also, I think the film overdid the 'deaths' throughout, which felt like they existed merely for 'shock value'. The large number of 'casualties' suggests that most, if not all, will be undone in the next film. Disappointingly, the end credits haven't anything interesting/special to look at. The after-credits scene doesn't offer much except the promise of hopefully something better yet to come with next year's Captain Marvel. Until then, here's hoping Ant-Man and the Wasp gives us a palate cleanser after this rather depressing installment.", "Just watched the movie a while ago. It's true time flies when you're having fun. Movie was very entertaining, hardly a dull moment. I thought the combination of comedy, action, and drama was spot on. Thor was just sick! Glad I got another set of tickets in two days. Definitely worth a second, maybe even a third watch. The hard part now is waiting for another year.", "Everyone dies. The joy of super hero movies is the triumph over evil.. this has none of that. This is bad guy spends entire movie ripping out audiences' hearts.", "What the hell? When we grow up, we been taught that: Good always wins over evil, Kindness always wins... Good will always prevail... Be good to others.. Always be kind... Pray for those who need it... and blah, blah blah.\nThis movie is really f* up (pardon my French), Thanos is a homicidal/genocidal maniac and yet the movie tried to depict him as some kind of hero or god on a mission. Hulk is just like a sad clown trying to be funny but so pathetic, I guess because the idiot director from Thor Ragnarok made him that way therefore the 2 idiots directed this movie carry on the same path.\nLike one of the reviewers commented, we go see superheroes to feel good, seeking escapism. We wish to have someone like Ironman, Spiderman, Captain America to right the wrongs, to seek justice for all, to protect the weaks and so on which doesn't exist in real life. And my 11 year old son adore them all (all the Marvel heroes), and I made a BIG mistake by taking him to see this sorry-ass movie, and it brokes his heart. It not nice at all to see all your idols get their ass kicked left and right throughout the movie then get killed at the end. Then... hang around waiting for the credit to end to watch some last segment of the movie indicate and left the movie theatre with some vague hope that \"part 2\" (which won't be out until next year) that something will happen to justify all this heart-breaking nonsense.\nHe is so sad that he told me today to give away all his bluray collection of Ironman, Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy. That would tell you something huh? I will not pay to see the next instalment of this crap and that a promise.", "Whatever the story lacks, Computer CGI compensates.", "As long as the stone is not a kidney stone, Purple Homer Simpson's Gotta Catch 'Em All! I had a couple of concerns before going into this feature and thankfully: I was wrong on both of them. Number one: I was dreading an hour plus long battle like at the end of Lord of the Rings 2-3, Matrix 3 and any Transformers movie. Personally, anything longer than 20 minutes of on-screen battles bore me. If I'm at home watching them, I will literally pull out my phone and play games while the battle rages on. This did not happen here. Thank you so much. I really didn't want to take a break and leave the theatre during a far-too-long battle scene.  And number two: I was concerned about the aforementioned Purple Homer Simpson. In the brief moments we've seen him before, he looked incredibly corny and fake and I never once believed he would be as all-powerful as they built him up to be. BUT, he ended up being the best character of the entire 16,090 characters they chose for this Part 3a. He was deep, interesting and the CGI wasn't that bad.  Now, the rest of the characters...were spot on from the same characters we grew with and loved for the past decade. Not a single actor stepped out of bounds and they owned their scenes. So, yeah, you simply cannot go into Avengers 3a without seeing, well, all of the previous 18 films. Most specifically, Thor: Ragnarok, the Guardians of the Galaxy films and Captain America: Civil War. But to sum up this mercifully simple plot, a big baddie is attempting to collect all the stones that originated the universe so he can play God with his warped sense of mercy. Our heroes, or \"Avengers,\" are spread out and thin across the universe, but do have a common goal of preventing Purple Homer Simpson from achieving his collection. I already knew this before going in, but if you didn't, you should prepare yourself for a Lord of the Rings 1-2 conclusion and an Empire Strikes Back storm before the calm. And also, for only 2nd or 3rd time in the ENTIRE MCU library, the post-credit scene is absolutely necessary to see. The other 15 or so times, I say just skip the post-credit scenes and wait to see them on the net. This one, yes, you really should see.  The movie got some many things right and a few minor errors. What went right: they chopped down the humor. In most Marvel movies, the humor seems to be 80% of the script leaving a small percentage for Superhero'ing action. I did find myself laughing out loud here a few times, but thankfully, it was just a few sprinkled jokes. I was there to see a Superhero movie and not another comedy. Also, as stated, the characters were spot on and the action scenes were intense, fresh and wholeheartedly used every bit of the Avenger in those scenes to their absolute potential. Further, aside from some major pacing and editing choices (MAN, some scenes seemed to end and the camera just kept on rolling for upwards of 5 seconds on more than a dozen scenes,) the movie never felt too long and certainly not 2\u00bd hours.  I can't give away my other huge gripe with this movie (other than the pacing/editing) without spoilers, but suffice to say, the third act, specifically the final moments really irked me. And no, not the abrupt ending - again, this was basically the ending to the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I hope, like I stated above, I am wrong on how I see the ending to this when I observe how Part 3b is handled. If I am wrong, then the stars I gave this movie will suddenly rise. Avengers Part 3a doesn't hold a candle to Avengers 1, but it does blow Part 2 out of the water. Still, you definitely need Part 2 to have any of Part 3a. Infinity War is definitely recommended, but I'd probably wait until the day Part 3b comes out and make sure you see, um, all of the previous 18 films prior, as well. *** Final thoughts: Since this movie is really just a first half of an overall chapter, I'd probably have to wait until Part 3b comes out before completely forming an opinion on where this ranks. That said, right now, I know it absolutely ranks high in the (so-far) 19 MCU films.", "Such a big pile of...\nIs the viewer really supposed to relate to Thanos? Like really?\nHis intentions and sacrifices were anything but touching.\nI'm so glad I didn't spend any cash to see it in the cinema.", "I was not amazed by this movie! Black Panther is way more culturally relevant.", "I'm 100% sure that all those negative reviews are from people who didnt even watch the movie or even worse from DC fans who hate marvel!!!\nThat's by far the best movie in the last couple of decades in terms of everything the movie industry could offer\nSo please ignorant reviewers be fair or dont write anything better \nThanks marvel for such an amazing 10 years", "I don't have a problem with people rating this film with less than 10/10. But people say the 10/10 ratings are bogus reviews, and yet, the 1/10 are listed as \"Most Helpful?\" Ridiculous. For a movie to have a 1/10 vote, you'd have to watch it with your eyes and ears shut and only know the name of the film, and the name sucks. And those reviewers probably don't realize why the movie is called \"Infinity War\" perhaps thinking that the war goes on for infinity (and beyond, HAH!). Qualifications for an only decent story, film:\nDoes it have character development? Check. This movie 10 years worth of character development.\nAny plot/story? Check. If you don't know who the villains are or who the heroes are, and what they are fighting for, you live in belly lint.\nAt any point did the audience react to a scene the way the filmmaker intended? Check. If you didn't at least smile once from an intended pun, or feel anger or sadness, or even humor during a fight scene with a well-known established character, then you don't know the character at all after 10 years. So this movie must then qualify as at least \"decent\" and a 1/10 review is not a \"decent\" rating, and yet those reviews are labelled/ordered as \"most helpful.\" Reviewers commented about the setup for the story and how some main characters die and some live to move the story along, have you EVER written a story? Would YOU kill off most of the main characters in the beginning of your story? Who then would want to read/watch your story? If those deaths are too convenient for you in that it is a plot device to move a story along, that still doesn't make for a 1/10 rating. When someone gets stabbed, death sometimes is not immediate, even in the heart. Someone has to die, in Thanos' eyes he doesn't want to kill everyone, just who he needs to in order to get what he wants. You may think Thanos is a fool for wanting to kill off half the universe, but to Thanos it makes total sense. Villains don't always kill for the sake of killing, don't always create chaos for the sense of anarchy. Sometimes they do villainous things thinking it is for the greater good, as wrong as they may be. Ultimately, reader, don't believe the \"hype\" of the 1/10 reviews. See it for yourself, judge for yourself. You'll be glad you did.", "From start to the last scene at the end of the credits, Avengers: Infinity War is a jaw dropping, action packed, adventure that will leave you craving more as the end credits start to run. Thanos is shown to be not only the biggest threat the Avengers has yet to face, but has also proven himself to be the best written and performed villain the MCU has had to date. This movie is a must see for any and every comic book fan out there and is highly recommended to those who are casual fans and sci-fi/adventure and comedy fans.", "Watched it for the 2nd time today. Great to see all our favorite characters in one movie. Exciting, heartbreaking and awe- inspiring.", "I've never seen the need to review anything... let alone rate an app, but this movie was just what the gods ordered. They ticked all the boxes of what I look for in a flick, and then some. Somehow, the directors managed to make the perfect action/adventure/sci-if flick all the while stitching together multitudes of characters, new and old, comedic scenes and heavy action. For me, Winter soldier had good action but felt rushed with too much going on for me to buy into their motives for feuding. Age of Ultron was just a disaster. And yet they used the same ingredients this time around, but with the perfect balance.", "Didnt like it at all, so much going on, too much actually going on, another open ending, how many of this movies are they gonna make? Might aswell make tv series out of them.", "Avengers IW was an insane movie. It was everything that I hoped for in part one of this installment. Marvel is so great. The ending was different from what I expected, yet also what I expected at the same time. Multiple storylines that are all great, great jokes, and also some very serious moments as well. Best Marvel movie thus far.", "Travelling by bus for a total of 800 plus kilometers just to watch it in IMAX is all worth it. I haven't read the comics but I'm really into the movie. The visual effects are superb! The story line is not dragging. The movie is like a puzzle, that was perfectly fit by the Russo Brothers! The fun is there, but it's so brutally dark that left us speechless.", "It's possibly the most ambitious movie I've ever seen. Celebrating 10 years of the Marvel cinematic universe, Infinity war has everyone in it. all the Avengers all the Guardians of the Galaxy, spider-man, Doctor Strange. It is overstuffed with comic book characters, but I did not find it overwhelming. I was more exciting to see all these characters do a team up. I will say that some characters got more screen time than others. some characters you think would dominate the movie did not and some characters you never thought were that important show you that's not the case. Josh Brolin as Thanos was an exceptional villain. the best these movies have to offer. As the Avengers and their allies attempt to stop Thanos from killing the universe, the character goes on this strange Lord of the Rings-like journey to find the infinity Stones, turning this Superhero movie into a Fantasy film.  Too slow at times as we get to know all the Avengers over again, and we also had to follow three different stories that sometimes drag, but everything is made up for with Thanos, who put this movie on a new level of drama.", "After a decade of spectacular films and cast of characters, the culmination of the entire MARVEL Cinematic Universe has led to this. 'Avengers: Infinity War' marks the first-half of what is to be a monumental cinematic event. With years of hype, does this film deliver and meet every expectation we've been hoping for? 1. This review is SPOILER FREE , but there will be mentions of certain sequences, however, I assure you there won't be any reveals. To make things simple, the mad titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) has finally decided to scour the universe in a hunt for all six infinity stones and deliver a balance to life and death that he sees fit. Blood will be shed and fear spreads as a fractured Avengers face their greatest threat as the fate of the world hangs in the balance. In all honesty, this film delivered on everything I wanted to see all whilst exceeding my expectations at the same time. One must remember that to fully appreciate this film, you had to have seen every MCU film prior to this. If you've missed films in between or if this in your first MCU experience, I'd heavily recommend that you catch up as soon as you can before seeing 'Infinity War' because you'd be utterly confused viewing this on its own.  2. Although all the characters are in one film, they're not all together (if you know what I mean). Certain Avengers are handling things in different places across the galaxy, so don't expect a unified team-up on this one. Everything has its place and I continue to stress that this is part one of two in the 'Infinity War' and Thanos' story. The three leading heroes (Captain America, Iron Man & Thor) are all on their respective quests until the ultimate convergence during the climax. Personally, the more intriguing story was Captain America's (Chris Evans) quest and the defensive actions in Wakanda, as well as Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) relationship with her adopted father Thanos. Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and the Guardians' plot is a close second while Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) was the least compelling. Not to say having three different story-lines is a bad thing, rather than which is more entertaining to follow.  3. Thanos is by far the greatest CGI creation I've seen come alive on-screen since Gollum. The effects are impeccable and Josh Brolin delivers an outstanding motion-capture performance as the mad Titan himself. There is an ere of sympathy to Thanos that I found interesting and all credit goes to the writers. He is (most certainly) a force to be reckoned with and can definitely be placed in the category of the greatest cinematic villains in history. What was equally impressive were Thanos' minions/followers, 'The Black Order'. Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw & Cull Obsidian respectively, are badass characters all of whom I'm dying to see more of. The action is spectacular and some of which I've never seen before. It was hard to contain my inner nerd the more the movie progressed closer and closer to that spectacular climax. So as far as action goes......no complaints whatsoever. 4. The one thing I found a little campy and I guess the only flaw of this film is that Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlett Witch's (Elizabeth Olsen) relationship. As seen in the trailers, Vision has evolved to the point in which he can now generate a human appearance. It's insinuated that both he and Wanda are intimate (having sex), and that's just awkward and somewhat gross to think about considering Vision is still a robot/machine of sorts despite his intellect. Besides that, I must warn audiences who've been spoiled by the happy/hopeful/humorous MCU endings thus far, because 'Infinity War' has a rather dark ending. When it was all over, I was unable to move from my seat and just sat there for a few minutes to wrap my head around the final event and realization of the films climax. Its somewhat of a cliffhanger but not entirely, because the film does have a legit conclusion. I felt fear and shed tears for certain characters as there is so much emotion tied into this film. Some sequences are truly heartbreaking despite the amazing action and moments of humor. Kudos to the direction of the Russo brothers and writers Markus & McFeeley, because 'Avengers: Infinity War' is truly one for the ages and a spectacle of a film. It it so fantastic that MARVEL has indeed succeeded the likes of DC and even Star Wars, as this is easily in the higher rankings of best comic-book films ever made.", "The task set out for infinity war is near impossible from a cinematic perspective. 18 movies culminate into this. 10 years of MCU. Over 7 different story arcs, over 70 characters some 20 of which are superheroes and are so thick that they have entire movie franchises built on them and another 30 easily deserve their own movie. And then you need a single villain large enough to take on so many of these superheroes and yet prove more formidable than all other villains who have ever graced the MCU. Not to mention the need to maintain the tonality of a guardians and sync it with the mysticism of a doctor strange and then blend it with the royalty of a Black Panther. All directed by different directors in different styles. \nAnd finally make all this live up to the hype. Make all character's count and earn fans, critics and the masses adoration alike. \n \nIt is fair to say that nothing quite like this has been attempted to date in movie history. From the onset this is a near impossible task.  And believe it or not Avengers: Infinity War delivers and delivers it with an action packed, genuinely funny and yet emotional punch.  So let's begin with the central theme of the film. From frame one you have Thanos walking in and in the first ten minutes you know what you are in for. Anything is possible is Inifinity War and the Russo brothers' vision is going to be as uncomprising as maybe Thanos' own vision of the universe. To be fair this is an out and out Thanos story. He is the central character and with 20+ superheroes, this is a wise script move.  No matter how well you understand the MCU nothing can prepare you for Thanos. His vision is evil yet logical. His methods psychopathic yet emotional. And his power is cruel yet absolute. Even if CGI, Josh Brolin's Thanos will go down in history as one of the top ten villians of all time.  Meanwhile the Avengers and the Guardians assemble together in bits and pieces trying to take on Thanos and his henchmen (who btw may look like Harry Potter rejects but are formidable in their own sense particulary Ebony Maw who floats around and has this eer ie philosophy of expecting victims to welcome death). These fights happen in various parts of the universe with only one objective to prevent the eponymous infinity stones from being taken by Thanos.  The genuinely laugh out loud ego clashes and the interactions of these super egoed super heroes are a highlight of the film but the laughter soon turns into mayhem as soon as Thanos' shadow falls on the scene. There are at least 7 story arcs mostly about love family and relationship and how far will characters go to sacrifice to get to their goals including Thanos. What is astonishing is that there is something for every character. You have this epic scene with Thor, another great one with Dr. Strange, the Guardians light up the screen every time they come on it with their unintended humour and then there is the whole black panther brigade - royal, clinical and deadly.  Mixing all of this together and making it a heart stopping 150 mins is the true cinematic achievement of Infinity war. The last 20 mins is like a Marvel movie on Flakka. Before you can even digest what is happening, it's already happened. \nIt is undoubtedly the unmissable movie of the year and arguably of the decade and if you are an MCU fan watch it before you start noticing the spoilers. As Thanos says \"Dread it. Run from it. Destiny will still arrive.\"  \nSpeaking of spoilers - SPOILER ALERT \nThe end credits scene literally spells out what will happen next and if Infinity War 2 will have this character in it then rest assured Kevin Feige is setting up an even more massive MCU part II. Cant wait for part 2 and the interim film that is essential.", "I must say after coming out I thought more about what I just seen, than any of the other movies in MCU.  It's a really well thought out plot, with lots of twists that are full of more action and fighting, than any of the other Avengers movie.  In regards to the amount of characters in the movie it can be at times a little overwhelming and doesn't give much room for the details of characters that you may have learned to love.  Thanos gets more screen time, than any of the other main characters, and maybe rightfully so. Thanos has never properly had a back story, like the others and evidently steals the movie. Josh Brolin dominates the show with his performance and was perfectly cast. His companions and henchmen could have also had more screen time or have been introduced before now.  The ending was not in any way predictable and very ballsy. Plus, one or two too many jokes for my taste, but I understand why they done it.  A solid 9 and ranks very highly in Marvel Cinema Universe.", "I just came out of the theater watching this movie and it has everything - from humor to drama, action, visuals, concept and characters. Thanos stands out beyond our expectations. As there many characters, this makes them less special. Many characters dies unexpectedly.  I would have to say that it is the best movie from Marvel's Studio. I loved Thano's characters so long after the Joker from The Dark Knight. Let's see post credit scene gives another movies or not. All these years of hard work is paid off. I can't wait for Avengers 4 now.", "I didn't see ALL that coming!\nIt's a AMAZING movie. Not like all the superhero movies before.\nI think they should have considered to tilte this movie \"Thanos: Infinity War.\" However, if they have really did that, less audience would come see this move. Most of people come in the name of \"Avengers\"", "Great CGI and visually good scenes, however i think the plot and script was bad and the charecters are the same old pain in the as* enoying ect. ect.", "This movie a little overrated. It is a good movie. But really is no Avengers age of Ultron. It has good acting. The story line could have been better. The first movie of the Avengers it a lot better.", "Oh gee golly gosh, I am just doing backflips after suffering through three hours of this movie starring, ahhh. Was this actually a movie, or advertisement for its sequel (sssss)? At least there were all sorts of stars in this thing. You know, ummmm, everybody and their brother and their sister and then some. Yeah. Everybody! Wowee! Makes the head spin 'Exorcist' style, yeehaw. So what were Ironman, those others and (my favorite) snotty, teenager Groot doing? I don't know. Fighting evil way out in outer space, kind of like Superman and Batman. Why didn't they run into them while they were out there? 'Infinity Wars' seemed like tremendous potential was wasted. For one thing, way too many superheroes. I lost interest in what they were all doing with the exception of Groot and the rest of Guardians of the Galaxy. This thing was probably 15 minutes too long. And I know I shouldn't say this, but I'm not wasting my time or money on the sequel. I like many of the early Marvel projects, but now they have gotten way too big. Meh, time to move on.", "Avengers: Infinity War was definitely the (2nd) best film I ever seen! Infinity War ha slots of action and is quite emotional in some places because of.... I want people to actually see my review so I'm not gonna say. But I love the idea of every MCU superhero coming together to fight the battles that they never could. Also, I think they did a great job casting Josh Brolin as Thanos as apparently he didn't do as well in Deadpool 2 so at least you can have some fame in a year! (Nah, but seriously he was in too many films this year)", "Movie will blow your mind and break your heart\nit's result of 10 years of movies", "This movie is amazing. By being the first half of a 2-parter which concludes the first 3 phases in the MCU, it could not have been better. The makers of this film are summing up 23 movies with these last 2 Avengers films beautifully. Rounding out the entire story arc with careful writing and doing every character his or her due justice. I applaud the Russo brothers for this achievement 110%, since it is most definitely not an easy task. The character who we have all been teased about \"coming to reek major havoc\" on our beloved super hero A-Team, The Avengers, and their new found friends, The Guardians of the Galaxy, is all and more I had hoped he would be. Thanos is a whole lot more dimensional in the MCU than in the comics, that is for sure. He has a deep meaning for his reasoning. He does horrible things, yes, but for, in his mind, a positive reason. And Josh Brolin does an excellent job in making Thanos believable. The pace of this movie is the most amazing thing about it. This is about a 2 1/2 hour movie, but it seems to fly by because every scene is jam packed with either fun character interactions, awesome action, or storyline importance. My eyes were glued to the screen in fascination. The ending was one of the most daring endings ever seen on film. I can not wait for Avengers 4. Avengers: Infinity War - 10/10", "The cliffhanger ending really annoyed me, The action and CGI was interesting but this movie is nowhere near the best movie of all time as many rate it to be so. I was actually disappointed after watching it, thinking to myself, that THIS is what everyone is raving about???", "First about the herd of low star ratings decrying the cost. Learn patience and wait until a library has a copy. \nSecond, the movie & music industries long ago established non-competitive pricing amongst themselves for their products that garnered excessive profits (like the pharmaceutical peoples today). Apple & digital helped to reduce that. The message at the beginning \"Piracy is not a victimless crime ... harms the economy.\" is in place w/the help of lobbyists and politicians (wanting donations), and is mostly meant to maximize those profits. \nThird, as to the movie it should be commended for it's vast CGI effects although it's getting computer cheap to produce those effects these days. On the down side, out CGI-ing everyone else has the effect of making us boringly saturated with over-effects, and loss of meaningful story, intelligent dialogue & good acting. \nFourth, don't expect intelligent scripting e.g. sound effects still in space; physically impossible space structures; bad science i.e. the Big Bang created six colored glass crystals??; the usual colored lasers; fire throwing, & force fields from your hands; swords, guns & naugahyde clothing (from cheap plastic if you don't know); aliens w/vocal structures that speak perfect English (at least they didn't script some subtitled alien speak). \nFifth, excessive dramatic music to sub for realistic and/or repetitive action. Dialogue amongst all seemed at a dumbed down level like neighbors arguing over which football team is better. Science dialogue such as describing a \"quadrant\" is pre-digital 19th century accuracy - dumb! \nSixth, the ending and the recently overused CGI of bodies turning to ashy bits of floating organic material was obscure, and meant to make more money on a sequel.", "This movie is a mind blowing as it contains marvel universe.\nMy all expectation is about AVENGERS 4. After the tragedy, i only imagines about next .", "Since I'm one of the last people, it seems, to see this movie, I'll keep it short and sweet. \nOne of the most incredible science fiction/superhero movies ever. Action and special effects are on full tilt.", "Once again no real full story. As I sat hoping for a helping of goodness I was left disappointed. Just about all the characters in the Marvel/Disney universe are brought together only to see them all torn asunder. Marvel/Disney sets you up with only part of the story. Looks like the Bad Guy has won and we are left wondering what will happen in the sequel. I realize this is a time honored tradition that dates back to the days of the \"cliff hanger\" shows like Flash Gordon but when you are paying the money we do to see a feature film I think it is time to finish a story. Yes another reach for our collective wallets. And now the collective Marvel/Disney people will go back to all the separate stories of all the remaining heroes and we will be left wondering how it will all shake out till they reunite them for another \"Blockbuster\"! At least those of us who have knowledge of the comic books have some comfort. The biggest spoiler of all so stop reading if you don't want to know. Yes, Thanos has all the stones but the \"time\" stone can basically redo all that Thanos did when he removed half of the beings in the universe. Take heart. Marvel/Disney would never really do away with any of their moneymaker characters for real. Just once I would like to see them refrain from the opportunity to blatently demonstrate the greed that pervades Hollywood. Just like the remaining heroes I guess I'll just have to decide next time if I will purchase the disc when it is released or wait till it is on Netflix or in a bargain bin.", "This movie is about as well-done as I can imagine it being which is the main reason why I give it a 10-star rating. It is EXACTLY what I expected out of this two decades-long movie in the making: it featured all of the MCU characters that it could handle (and possibly a few more than advisable), amazing CGI and fight scenes, and a great setup for a fantastic finale to the infinity war story line that has been led up to for 31 movies so far. I have read many of the poor reviews and wanted to offer another perspective for those reading these claims of plot-holes, terrible character development, and overall poor writing and are considering whether or not it is worth it to them to see the movie (for those of you who don't mind spoilers). The bad reviews basically highlight the same \"issues\" as follows: Thor's powers. The end of Thor: Ragnarok shows us that Thor's true power didn't come from his hammer, but that he is the god of thunder (and lightning basically). Many people apparently can't understand how Thor with his newfound powers can be so easily (seemingly) defeated by Thanos with one infinity stone at the beginning of the movie, but at the end of the movie Thor nearly kills Thanos with his new axe while Thanos possesses all six stones. Everyone who points this out as a major plot hole conveniently forgets the circumstances surrounding Thor and Thanos' final fight: Thanos had just gotten the last stone and was surprised by Thor's ambush-style attack and he had no idea that Thor had a new weapon strong enough to kill him. Bloated with too many characters. My question to these people would be \"what did you expect?\". This movie is the first of a two-part finale to a story line that has spanned multiple franchises with some of the most recognizable characters in today's cinema; of course they were going to feature every character they possibly could since that is half of the reason that people want to go to those types of movies. Could they have used fewer characters and still made a high-quality film? I say yes, but I don't think that it would have necessarily made it a better movie. \"Death\". Many people criticize the MCU for having their characters be safe from death. Infinity War tried to break that mold by killing off about half of the characters in their movie, but some people take issue with the fact that most of those \"deaths\" occur in the last few minutes of the movie and that they obviously will revive a lot of the characters since they have future movies planned with those characters being in the title. One, it's a setup movie, of course they aren't going to do a lot of perma-killing yet as that will be in the second movie. Two, there seem to be at least two, maybe three major character deaths that are permanent which is an incredible number considering precisely no major characters had permanently died prior to this movie. Also I'd like to point out that temporary deaths are a regular occurrence all across the superhero genre and anyone who doesn't like that most likely will have a hard time appreciating even the most well made superhero movies. Feeeling secure in character continuity is part of the fun! Besides, it is a virtual guarantee that there will be at least a few (if not several) major character deaths in the second infinity war movie. No emotion. Were these people awake during the movie? This movie was an intense roller coaster of emotion as it went from despairing lows to hopeful highs and back to depressing lows again. In conclusion, this movie is highly entertaining and accomplishes everything that a part one movie could hope to accomplish.", "I really lived Civil War, this was equal or better. The humor was back to were it should have gone, unlike Thor Ragnarok. Guardians Of The Galaxy actors were fun and great. Same for Iron Man. Great movie, thanks Hollywood!!!", "Before I review the film, a disclaimer might be needed. To fully appreciate this movie, you'll need to have seen at least one of the other avengers films or solo films to be somewhat familiar with the characters, otherwise you'll just end up very confused and not invested.  The anticipation for this movie was through the roof. Not often do you see people that hyped for a movie - especially a superhero themed flick. Avengers: infinity war had a lot to live up to.\nThe film revolves around Thanos, not the avengers, but Thanos is the main character. He definitely is a well created 'villain'. Though I am not sure villain is the right word to describe him. His intentions essentially are good, his method is just a tad morbid. It will make you question your morals, and it makes you think about the state of the earth, which is indeed overpopulated You'll find fans rooting for either Thanos or our heroes  The actors delivered a splendid performance, with heartfelt and realistic reactions to the events around them. The producers may have gone a bit overboard with the CGI, but it's done in such a beautiful and realistic way that you won't even notice. One of the best things about this movie is that for once, you can't expect a good ending. Anything can happen. Usually with superhero movies you know that the heroes will survive, which takes away the tension. With Infinity War you truly don't know who will survive or not, so that makes every fighting scene very intense. The soundtrack was exhilarating as well. Marvel is well known for its forgettable soundtracks, but this one was definitely recognisable. The avengers theme blasted through the cinema speakers and it was amazing. \nThe cinematography is gorgeous as well. The film is amazing, but you do need to be familiar with the characters. There's a lot of things going on in this movie, and there obviously isn't any time to introduce every character. Marvel has spend ten years to set up this epic, so every past film is essential to fully appreciate the grand epic that Infinity War truly is.", "I was a big fan of Captain America, Winter Soldier and Doctor Strange, but i had enough.", "I really enjoyed this film already watched it twice and i'd love to watch it again", "Avengers: Infinity War is something that, on the first watch, you're absolutely blown away by. You walk out of the theater satisfied. It acts as a reward for sticking with the MCU and it does deliver. What I appreciate most is the fact that while this is certainly the avengers' movie, it's also the main villain Thanos' story.  One thing that this may seem is overstuffed. It's a lot to take in, certainly, and with so many characters to fit in, of course it's going to seem that way. There certainly could have been some improvements to the story, but overall the plot was well done. The direction is what stands out. The Russo brothers have crafted an addition that truly serves as a fantastic piece of blockbuster action while remaining faithful to the previous MCU directors. One last thing I don't normally compliment: the CGI and visual affects were on point. Marvel has never had a real problem with it in the past, but this was just plain amazing. One of the most visually dazzling films of this last year. Avengers: Infinity War is a culmination of 10 years of good films that mostly lives up to the hype. (8/10)", "After reading some negative reviews on here, I fail to understand how the filmmakers could've made a better movie then what they brought out. People are saying there is no plot or story. To me it's a movie about a big giant villain that's trying to get the 6 infinity stones (that's been mentioned pretty much since the first guardians movie) and his quest to get them and a band of different heroes joining forces to stop him. What more do you want? I thought the Russos did a good job with the amount of characters they had to deal with. Ok some of the jokes were dumb but not as dumb as the ones in Ragnorok. I even read a review from someone saying they are not a marvel fan and he/she doesn't like any of the movies including this one. That is just telling me that you're an idiot. Why put yourself through all that? I watched the first 2 Harry Potter movies and didn't like them so I stopped there and not watch the rest of them. Ok I'm getting off topic. The movie was great, the CGI was second to none, in my opinion all the characters got their fair share of time. The editing was pretty good, the music drew me in, Thanos was a really interesting villain. It wasn't the best dialogue I've heard but it was far from the worst. The acting was great by half the cast (Elizabeth Olsen and Zoe Saldana to name a couple) and decent by the other half (Benedict Cumberbatch and Chris Evans to name a couple). Looking forward to part 2", "I really enjoyed this film, the acting was spot on, the CG effects were pretty good, but could have been better in places... The fact that Joss Whedon wasn't attached makes it all the better... But the story could have gone in a much different direction if the protagonists had used a little common sense. SPOILERS BELOW!\nThere's the point in the film where Iron man, Dr. Strange, Spiderman, Starlord, Draco, Mantis, etc... Have Thanos subdued and are attempting to pull his gauntlet off... Surely if Thanos was that big of a threat.... could they not have just killed him there and then? We know the Avengers, guardians of the Galaxy etc aren't above killing to save the world, so why would they not kill him to save the whole universe? Surely that should have been one of the 14,000,605 possible futures that Strange saw right?\nHow did Thanos know the mind stone was in Wakanda? No one told him it was there, the place is hidden from the world, and he obviously doesn't have an innate ability to locate them otherwise he would have easily known where the soul stone was.\nAnd how is it that the magical gauntlet managed to kill all of the heroes EXCEPT those that were in the ORIGINAL Avengers movie? Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie, but a lot of it seems awfully contrived just so they could make a sequel, when, in fact, it could have all been so easily resolved with just a bit of common sense.", "An awesome movie.. Two stories (one in earth and the other one is space) handled very well.. The movie doesn't bored the audience.. It has got Action, Comedy, Emotions all of it.. Desperately waiting for Part 2 specially for Dr. Banner with his issues with Hulk which was interesting, And for Code Red and for Tony Stark as what's gonna be his plans for the other heroes..", "I can't pretend that this film is the best example of quality film making, but boy is it a crowd pleasing blast from beginning to end. One of the most exciting nights at the cinema I've ever had (opening night in IMAX was amazing).", "This movie had me at the end of my seat. First movie I went to go see 3 times in theaters", "Let's admit it, people love watching sacrifices made out of love. We just can't get enough of that mushy pathos of the most pointless, irrational and simply plain wrong things being done just because it would lessen the suffering of a single human being (or maybe even a puppy), albeit just for a moment. This is humanity. And, judging by the rating, it is madly in love with Avengers Infinity War. Well, no surprise, since, for the first time in a while, Marvel Studios made a film that dwarfs most of the melodramas ever created in terms of making the soft-hearted people shed a tear or two. The war is waging across the whole galaxy over the topic of sheer survival of myriads of living beings, and our brave heroes, so eager to care none about the collateral damage before, have suddenly become too soft to handle the fact that someone might not make it eventually. And what a time to grow a conscience! Thanos is about, the looming figure from the past Marvel movies, the phantom menace of this cinematic universe, and he's come to strike it big this time. And with him, a huge army of creatures equally ugly and disposable and a few special units he calls his children, finally with a speck of individuality, but still ugly as the rest. Makes you start wondering if those Titan genes are really the best judge of the galaxy's fate. As for \"the good guys\", they are quite aplenty too. Maybe even too aplenty to actually have any decent interaction among each other, unless we count some quarrels and a few flashy co-op FPS action scenes interaction. Tom Holland does try to bring his old lively \"friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\" attitude, but he's severely outnumbered in this game of big talk and personal issues. Even Steve Rogers, the only guy who was previously known for bringing charisma and integrity into everything he's involved in, is demoted to a mere fighting machine. He's good at that, no doubt about it, but after Winter Soldier and Civil War you expect much, much more from that character. But this time your expectations are your own problem I'm afraid. The rest you have probably seen yourself - and if you haven't then you probably should, because, even with its somewhat generic and one-dimensional taste, Infinity War is still quite good as an action flick. The moving figures won't let you doze off too soon, and a few \"deep\" dialogue scenes will keep your palate from getting too numb if you have a taste for anything besides punches and gunshots. Still, after all we've seen from Marvel in these ten years, Infinity War leaves a rather dull aftertaste. Not as pathetic as Iron Man 3, but something between GotG2 and Thor Dark World. In other words, the intense buildup and high expectations make the actual endeavor feel faded. Like all those figures from the ending, this movie doesn't present any substantial endpoint - but rather flakes away, so that instead of feeling absolutely overwhelmed you simply go check on your Instagram updates while the (surprisingly rather impressive) ending credits score keeps banging, find no new posts and feel somewhat disappointed. The film wasn't bad per se. But most of the fan theories and memes people generated while waiting for this to hit the theaters were indeed more exciting. In a way, that does create a balance of sorts, something Thanos would have appreciated, but, as for you, I wouldn't be so sure.", "I have watched this movie several times now. And I am glued to the screen each time. The set pieces are beautifully rendered and the details in the costumes are phenomenal.  Thanos is probably the best villain the Marvel universe has seen. After 6 years of teasing...He is really worth the wait. He is dealing with his own demons as he inflicts his 'balanced' universe theory on our superheroes.  Our heroes...what can I say. After growing up with the original 6 from 2008 it is so good to see how they have come. They have matured and so have we as an audience.  For those who have not followed all the Marvel movies...this movie is a brilliant stand alone movie.", "Going to keep this short. Probably the best action movie of the year, if not ever. Has all of the Marvel Superheroes mashed up just like the comics do when massive scale events happen. This last statement takes me to all the negative reviews. Why oh why?? You guys do realise it is Part 1 of 2 right?? Before you give it a 1 star because, oh well you have no idea about the actual MU and MCU. I suggest you at least google \"Infinity Gauntlet\" which is the original story of Thanos, also the actual Infinity War from the comics. \nI am not providing any spoilers here since what I have mentioned can be seen in the trailers and synopsis, what I did mention was based on Marvel Universe knowledge. No idea which route the directors will take but please bear with the 2nd part before you tell people not to \"waste\" their time, that this is the last marvel movie or by giving it a score under 5 stars. Here are the main reason why this movie doesn't deserve the under 7 reviews it got: 1) It is a 2 part movie so bear with it until you actually watch the second part?\n2.a) Huge, massive scale event in the Marvel Universe. Due to Thano's goal every being in the known/unknown Universe WILL come to take him down. Frankly the movie didn't have every Superhero Character in existence, for example the X-Men and Fantastic 4.\n2.b) The supreme beings of the Marvel Universe; an all-star lineup including Galactus, Kronos, Epoch, the Living Tribunal, and a bunch of others like the personifications of concepts like Chaos and Order come after him.\n3) Many many people and superheroes would have not realised what Thanos did until after he snapped his fingers. So don't go crying that it is the end of the world.\n4) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 - End Credits - Hint hint Adam Warlock. Even though he may not make an appearance in the 2nd part.\n5) One of the most powerful superheroes in existence and not quite as known should make an appearance in the 2nd part to help out. End credits, Carol Danvers.\n6) Following point 3 (for all the whiners), anyone can put the gauntlet on and snap their fingers one more time... and... wait for it, wait for it... undo what has been done. I hope you enjoy this amazing movie.", "Great story. Great visuals and characters. A movie you can watch with your family and friends (yay). Loved the fights and plenty of humor for a movie that seemed more serious than most in the MCU. Great cliffhanger, I will definitely see the next one. Sad ending. RIP spiderman. My eyes got a little wet when all those people died. Most people might enjoy avengers: infinity war.", "... I don't understand, yes some of the characters that were dusted we'll know will be back because they've more films announced but seeing the deaths of some of them during the dusting scenes were still an emotional gut punch, anyone who wasn't moved by Tom Holland's acting during his death scene have to be emotionless morons!\nThere have been 18 films in the MCU prior to this not as some have said 31! All those prior 18 films have had plot threads going into Infinity War. Thanos is the best villain Marvel has had in all their MCU films and Josh Brolin even in motion capture/CGI still made Thanos an interesting character who in his own twisted way did what he did for the right reasons. Part of the problem I think some reviewers had was the number of characters who had more or less screen time than they thought they deserved, and yes we know most if not all the characters who were killed will probably be back by the time the credits roll in Avengers 4 but this doesn't distract from the steller job the directors & screenwriters have done with such a huge story and cast. Believe the more genuine reviews rather than the overly critical ones, at least Marvel know how to make a superhero film work which is more than DC/Warners are doing with their films (I thought bringing Josh Whedon in to tidy up Justice League would help but unfortunately it didn't).\nThis is by far the MCU's best film and I would imagine there are others who agree with me on that!", "It's a great time to see the movie in theaters, even if you didnt go, go buy the digital copy or blu ray and use surround sound if have a speaker system. About the film this is very entertaining, I recommend to anybody who saw the last 3 movies", "Since I have watched a lot of films & anime, I rarely am excited at the movies. But the great Titan Thanos has blown my jaded mind to pieces. A must watch masterpiece, not just for the story or action or direction, but for how well balanced & entertaining it was.", "What a film. Best marvel Avengers film to date.  Everything about this film was perfect. I don't really have any more to add!", "WOULD 100% SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN, loved everything about it the way it all came together and the ending OMG what an emotional rollercoaster i can't wait for the next one......i loved what they done at the end but it leaves me woundering if they will come back or they will have new ones take over this would be awesome to see as would more marvel movies around the advengers i can not wait XD!!", "I rated this a 10 because it delivered in every way possible. It may not be the greatest movie ever, but without giving anything away, it addressed everything that was hyped. We wanted a movie to kick start the Infiity War, and a movie that was great in its own right. I think that's what we got. And it made the original Avengers (an epic movie when it came out) look minuscule in scale. \nThanos is not just a mindless killing machine. We could even grow to understand him. The other characters may still be in their own box, but that's they way we love them. Despite that, they've all developed over the last 10 years, been through their troubles and triumphs.\nKeen as to see the next chapter in the Mavelverse for Earth's Mightiest Heroes.", "Its rated 8.8 they should put it in top 15\nNot 20 . Marval very good company for movies", "We don't deserve this movie. There was some sort of glitch in the matrix. See it while you can!", "It's getting old. And there is too much reliance on different matchups of Marvel celebrities (the movie frames these moments in a way, with a pause, for the \"ahhh\" factor - \"wow we got a cameo from so and so! And he's fighting along so so and so!\" Thanos character development was pretty good though. Marvel needs to stop relying on its fame and past success by taking easy formulas with no unexpected twists, and simply sugar coating it by putting their now famous characters together.", "This movie is a 10 for me.  Glued from the beginning to the end. It was awesome to see how the Producers were able to connect such a huge story, different fight scenes and a huge number of characters. Understandably that most people are furious about how the movie ended, doesn't make it a less better movie. In fact this made me more curious as to what will happen in the next Avengers movie.", "So this is what the whole previous 18 MCU movies were working towards? WORTH IT. This movie was dark, funny, and just pure awesome. The opening scene will put a chill down your spine, and it's only when this scene is over do you truely understand what your watching. It has a great mix of humour to make this movie not too dark, but a perfect amount which DC may be lacking. And once the movie is over, you will walk out of the cinema wondering \"what did I just watch...\" this is truly is a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come, nothing can top this.", "Avengers: Infinity War is an incredible show that should leave all fans of Marvel speechless before the work done by Joe and Anthony Russo. The film has everything to be the new benchmark of the blockbuster as it connects the visual prowess If James Cameron would like the public to get tired very quickly Super Heroes movies, it is clearly not with this kind of feature film that it risks happening . Perfectly punctuated and filled with offbeat humor and intense emotions, the feature film is one of the best Marvel with the first Avengers and The Guardians of The Galaxy. A new cardboard insured for Marvel Studios which we wait the following impatiently", "This is a movie like joker in batman,thanos is as emotional,intelligent and enlightened as joker", "First of all, don't spread unfair hatred because of your love for DC. I love both of them to death and if you are a real fan then you will love this movie.\nnow the review:\nI felt the same amazement when i watched the Avengers 1, you wont realise where your time went. It is entertaining, engaging, has a good story and actually makes you feel for the villain. Thanos is a worthy villain who actually has a motive which even you will agree at some point. the cgi is amazing, it feels so real. the movie is less funny than other marvel movies and i thank the russo brothers for that. In the end it just makes you wanting for more.\nmy personal guarantee that you would love it.", "When I watch this movie I've got the same feeling when I saw Thunder Cats the Movie ... that moment when you saw all your heroes in one movie ... This movie is perfect in everything, story, characters, VFX, SFX, Music and everything else", "I love this film. For the scale and sheer mass of a project like this I think the Russo's did an amazing job. The exposition is key for me: too much and I'm clearly watching a Michael Bay film.Too little and well, it would be a straight to DVD flick. This is just below perfect for me. It's a 9 because there are inconsistencies in logic that slightly tarnish an otherwise excellent film. I have to remember that it's only 50% of the story so maybe I'll track back and change this amateur review.", "I am a huge fan of the MCU, I feel Marvel has been on a roll recently. Every film they make is different then the last. Avengers Infinity War brings most of the heroes of the MCU together to fight Thanos. The movie is full of amazing action, cool visuals, emotional moments, a great humor, and a lot of surprises. Every character gets time to shine. The film's ending will leave you waiting for the fourth Avengers film.", "Don't listen to these low raters because they don't know what this movie is", "This movie is better / as good as the previous MCU movies.\nat the time of my reivew the average of 300,000 reviews is 8.8\nwhich is crazy!\nwho would rate it 1 or 2 start? XD haters and jealous people who can follow the storyline or not interested at all!", "I am not a fan of marvel but, they should make \"THANOS STORY\"\nI am damn sure that will be 10/10 hit.", "When you combine a decade's worth of characters all in a two-and-a-half hour movie, obviously you're going to have to keep the character development to a minimum. It also won't help if you haven't seen all of the 20-ish movies leading up to this one, where the character development is pretty well utilized, especially for a studio now putting out three to four of these things a year. I knew this going in, which is why I didn't expect some deep character piece. Still, I felt certain scenarios and characters could have shown at least a bit more energy, instead of just seeming like some cardboard cut-outs, but again, it didn't detract from my experience, because I wasn't expecting much from individual characters. I think it's also pretty clear that this isn't a movie that focuses on the heroes. This movie does something new, where the bad guy takes center stage, and is the one with the character development. Finally, we get a villain that we can understand. He isn't trying to destroy half the universe for absolutely no reason other than to be evil, which is one thing the MCU has been lacking.  The ending made me feel very different from any other ending I've seen. Seeing things transpire as they did was shocking, but not surprising...and what I felt is still just so indescribable because no movie ending has really done what Infinity War has done. Thankfully, certain lines from a certain character insinuate not all is as it seems. Bottom line is, if you're expecting Tarantino, Hitchcock, or Kubrick filled with deep themes, emotional character studies, or groundbreaking cinematography, then you clearly don't understand the genre. If you're expecting an exciting movie filled with moments that make you want to punch the air, an ending that will leave you stunned and a bit confused, and a film that begins to wrap up over 20 movies, then you'll have a good time, like I did.", "Best Marvel movie be a long shot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "If you like action, humor, and drama, this is your movie. With a climax that is BREATHTAKING! The best character in the movie is Thanos. He has so many layers. Even though he's the villain he can be very loving. He truly does love Gamora. This movie is just amazing.", "I don't normally review movies but seeing this at 16 on Top 250 is severely heartbreaking.  \nThis does injustice to movies like Matrix, Gladiator, Seven Samurai, Goodfellas, City of God, Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, The usual Suspects, Spirited away, Pianist, Whiplash, Departed, Prestige, Memento, Apocalypse Now, Django Unchained, Wall-E etc. which are multiple times better than this CGI laden story for kids that took 10 years in the making.", "Loved it! It had everything- humor, great effects, Thor, drama and did I mention Thor? The pirate/angel man!", "Big love from huge fan from Vietnam. I don't care much about people mixed review. All I needed from a perfect movie is here, to conclude all great previous effort of Marvel studio have putted into their fan. Only someone who have time following the cinematic timeline of MCU can truly understand the ultimate meaning of A:IW.\nStory: Everything is inter-connected and solid (from objects to characters). The pace is not too fast and not too slow for us (fan) to enjoy it.\n*Spoiler Alert*\nThe movie continues right after ending of Thor: Ragnarok, showing the battle between Thanos's forces and Marvel super heroes (include almost any heroes from previous we have seen so far). Thanos, who looks like a chaotic lawful super-villain. His ultimate purpose is to destroy half-population of entire universe (including Earth) as a solution to over-population on universe which bring so many terrible things to mortal life (such as starvation, planet pollution, resources exhausting, wars for survival....). I can rarely see any movies which can deeply depict into a super-villain this far, to show how their defines justice. Thanos is like a god-like hero in his own right, with extremely will-power and determination to achieve victory over our beloved Marvel superheroes.\nI can not say how I feel after so many deaths of our heroes. But to be honest, I am grateful for that, because that means we can see more interesting characters in the future. This is not only a definite meaning to the MCU itself but to Marvel studio and viewers as well. \n There are so many great things on this movie that I don't need to say. You can see other great reviews as well about movie CGI, smooth fighting scenes, how they well-correlated with each other. Unbelievable good job, Marvel studio. Thank you for bring this movie to us.  My Rating: 10/10 Funny fact: The movie is also a thing that make me waiting for such long times like never before and also bring satisfaction like never before. It brings so much fun, sad, emotion together in such a short-firm period. \nThis is my first review in IMDB so don't judge me please. :))", "Yes yes yes yes yes eys eys eys eysyeyses yesyes let me post this so the movie gets a higher rating aggh", "This movie blew me out of the water, as a comic book fan I was skeptical of such a large scale movie with my beloved superheroes. \nHowever, the movie was phenomenal, such a ground breaking film. Breaking records here there and everywhere and so worth it. Definitely living up to the hype.", "This is the movie we were waiting for 10 years. TEN YEARS CARL! Ten years of work lead to this very moment. Truly historic event. I am very happy to live in this time and see such an amazing things happen on our planet. This is the movie when you come out of the theatre stunned by WOW-effect. I'm sure this movie would hit 2bln. $.", "This movie was Amazing ! i actual think this is the best movie i have ever seen.", "If you consider yourself a fan of the Marvel universe, you can stop reading here and just go watch \"Infinity War\". Of course, your mileage out of it will vary depending on your investment with the MCU, so it should be stated that while I have seen all the other movies in the franchise save for \"Doctor Strange\" (just haven't gotten around to watching it yet) and even a couple of their TV series, I wouldn't consider myself a big fan. That is to say, I don't generally rewatch most of the films in the series, though I have enjoyed all of them, some more, some less.  I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did. Bringing together all the characters from 18 different movies, most of which I have half forgotten since their respective release dates, in a two-and-a-half-hour superhero science fiction action epic that inevitably is going to act as a jumping-of-point for another couple of sequels and also has to throw in fan service for people who have been following this franchise for ten years much more obsessively than I did, that sounds like a movie that could make my brain hurt a lot. Thankfully, \"Infinity War\" is about as good as a movie like that could realistically be. If it were any better, I would seriously have to call it a masterpiece.  Especially in its first half, \"Avengers 3\" is incredibly entertaining. The various meet-ups of Marvel characters seems fairly fluent (though there are a few convenient coincidences that drive the characters together), and the superhero banter rarely gets in the way of the story. Thanos is a good villain, and the script goes a long way in making him out as an intimidating and interesting threat.  The Russo brothers have also staged their action scenes quite well: Though there are a few moments where the camera movements were too quick for me to make out what part of the carnage I was seeing, most of the fight scenes are a lot of fun to watch, thanks to great cinematography (when it was filmed in an appropriate tempo) and choreography. For the kind of movie it is, there is even some restraint in those scenes, as the final battle doesn't outstay its welcome and most of the action scenes feature a rather small amount of villains - though fans of gigantic battle scenes obviously need not worry, there's enough of that, too.  Emotionally, the film is - as advertised - much darker than the rest of the franchise, though Team Feige is too smart to turn their flagship movie into a depressing, joyless melodrama. As in their own movies, the Guardians of the Galaxy sometimes even ruin emotional scenes for me with some ill-placed punchlines. But there's still many moments in which even amidst all the effects-heavy destruction you can see how good the actors in this movie are.  There are a couple of missteps that the movie takes, most of them all but inevitable. Not all of the 30+ main characters of the story would have needed to be in the film, and occasionally their presences are a bit distracting, if only for the fact that I found myself thinking \"What is --- doing right now?\" when a scene doesn't give them much to do and instead focuses on the bigger players. Furthermore, as was hard to avoid, making the Avengers split up into several sub-groups on their own individual quests means dividing the main story into many subplots, and, not all of them are equally interesting. Particularly frustrating is the part of the film in which a number of action scenes happen simultaneously in different places, yet as if that wasn't enough they also had to throw in a slower scene that runs concurrently (and would have fit much better into an earlier section of the film).  This film is far from perfect, but the fact that I enjoyed it at all is a minor miracle to me. If you've enjoyed (most of) the Marvel movies up to this point, it almost goes without saying that \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is a must-watch. I would not go as far with my praise as others have, but I did have a great time watching it.", "Marvel have embarked on a massive project to link up many movies over a decade to a grand finale featuring all of the main heroic characters of the movies. However, the inifinity stones are more of a thread linking the movies than a story in itself. The story of the stones is what infinity wars is about. So it's a new story but populated with characters already developed so the character development is that of Thanos, the villain. Josh Brolin is brilliant as Thanos but his back story is a biit lame, perhaps as a result of distillation from the comics, but still for a movie of this scale a bit thin. All of the Marvel characters are involved and it is just too much for the film, giving it an air of contrivance, Comic relief is probvided largely by the Guardians of the Galaxy even that is not so fresh anymore. On the whole it is enjoyable family fluff but falls in many respects due to ridiculous levels of suspension of disbelief.", "Excellent adaptation of the comics Infinity Gauntlet Saga! Thanos steals the show, Iron Man is awesome in this flick. It leaves you wanting to see more, personally i hope they will show Adam Warlock in Part 2. Oh yes, do remember this movie is a Part 1 of two parts saga. Part 2 should be very interesting. The Infinity Gauntlet War saga shatters the universe and it may start events of cosmic and interdimentional proporsions (as in The Beyonders ;-) ) We will see how the MCU will evolve from the ending of Phase 3 :D", "This movie knows how to do serious moments. And comedic moments.\nThey put together a truckload of characters and it somehow works. Really well.", "The all film is good for stories and artists grfex", "Avengers: Infinity War could just be the greatest marvel movie.... oh wait..... it is!! This movie is bone chilling and ground breaking. The action, characters, score, visual effects are all amazing! And Thanos, oh boy Thanos. He is the best marvel villain without a doubt. He is complex and sorta makes you emphasize with him. Josh Brolin does an amazing job adapting the character. He even cry's! And that's motion capture. The standout is Robert Downey Junior though. Best Iron Man performance. You know what, everyone is great. The ending will 100% make you cry and is breathtaking!! 10/10!!!!", "This movie - WOW. Everything about it is amazing. After years of speculation and anticipation Marvel/Disney truly delivered on their promises. I'm not going to spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, but I will say that this is the best Marvel movie to date.  The combination of the Avengers, the Guardians, and all the other heroes and supporting characters from each of the 18 movies leading up to this is a feat in itself. All the characters have remained true to their past versions, and the proper introduction to Thanos was that indeed - proper. I have been a marvel fan my entire life, so when I read reviews from casual viewers who were disappointed or had trouble believing how Thanos can do things/overpower characters they are used to seeing (yes there are many bad reviews), all I have to say is they know nothing. In the comics Thanos is an unbelievably powerful character, so my advice to the casual viewer who doesn't know much about these characters is to get informed. If you know what you are walking into you will be extremely impressed with what you see. It's not just the power perspective of Thanos, but also the emotional aspect of his nihilistic ways that can somewhat be understandable and allow to you see things from his perspective (in no way condoning his decisions). As for the movie it contains many moments of laughter, great action sequences, and for those with any knowledge of the comics some powerful, emotionally charged scenes. This movie is now my favorite Marvel movie, which was previously either Guardians of the Galaxy or Captain America Civil War. I left the movie in awe and can't wait to see it again, and a whole year until the sequel is going to feel like a lifetime. Oh, and see it in IMAX if you can, it was specifically shot with an IMAX lens and it is well worth it.", "Don't go for the story. Don't even think about watching it for the hype that it has. You might even start treating it as overrated if you are not a fan but just want to judge everything (and of course, the end). But there's a lot more to it than that. You are literally watching 20 or more, greatest actors of this decade, all together in a span of 2 hours 30 min. Included with some of the best visual effects put with such creativity that shows each of their powers used together as a team. There's every bit of detail kept right on top. Even the characters portrayed have been top notch while crossing over not just for us audience but also meeting for the very first time in the plot. And the kind of reactions they have is exactly what we were expecting. Maybe even better, obviously because they defeat each other at sarcasm. You'll obviously need a lot of past information before watching this one. I'll leave that to you. The movie starts with the kind of dark tone it has most of the time. It tries to make you laugh and we all do. We scream, we laugh, we \"Ohhhh\", we cry. It is a whole bunch of emotions. It is for every Marvel Fan. And for those who are not a fan, it is for you too, because this is history, my friend. You ought to be a part of it. I hope they remember you.", "While the movie was a extremely fascinating and exhilarating the movie had too many characters. Non marvel fans wouldn't understand all of the characters back story and their history. Also the ending left many people crying and in sorrow while leaving the theatre. As I said the movie was amazing but confusing to the unknowing.", "I had such high expectations for this film due to all the hype around it but WOW it actually exceeded all of my expectations.\nI've never written a film review on here before, I just needed to express, and let everyone else know how amazing Infinity War really is.\nThere were so many moments where I laughed, cheered and cried. The best Marvel film ever, the best film of the year. Everyone who had any part in creating this masterpiece needs recognition but the Russo's really did it.", "Loved it! Leaves you on the edge of your seat and devastated - all hope is gone! But... as a new movie is on the horizon, a glimmer of hope sparks in me...", "Action-packed, emotional with some laughs along the way of course! Thanos is the most powerful villain EVER! The team-ups are great and so is the banter of course! There's only one thing I was devastated about was... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RIP LOKI :\"(", "I went to the movies with expectations of being a little confused since I haven't seen a lot of the Marvel movies that came out in the last decade that passed. But still, this movie was able to give the perfect amount of background story to make it a compelling movie and then some. I cannot believe how good this movie is. I won't spoil it for you but the last 10 minutes of this movie are amongst the best I have ever seen of any movie. I also noticed he use of foreshadowing for the final scene with expanded my fing mind ever more. The action sequences are incredible and the whole cast did an amazing job, not only with the great comedy the writers blended into the story, but also the heartbreaking and very mysterious sequences of this movie. With all that being said there were some moments in this movie I found to be a little dull (such as the piece of trash that decides to be selfish). I cannot recommend this movie enough though, even for people who aren't particularly fans of superhero movies.", "If you're a fan of the marvel universe, this is for you. Have fun.", "We all knew going into this film that it would be one of the best Marvel has ever produced. With Anthony and Joe Russo as directors, it couldn't disappoint. And seeing as it is a cumulation of 10 years of action packed marvel films, it had all the ingredients to be a great film. And that's what it was. As one of the most highly anticipated films of the 21st century, Avengers Infinity War certainly delivered. From the opening 10 minutes it set the tone. Thanos made a statement killing the much loved Loki and Heimdall whilst Thor was made to watch, and that he abused Hulk to the point that he didn't come out for the rest of the film was terrifying. Although certain characters such as Captain America, now going as Steve Rodgers and certainly not Nomad, and Black Panther didn't get enough screen time was annoying but the standouts such as Thor and Scarlet Witch was promising with a lot of goosebump moments and the best villain Marvel has produced, Thanos. The final deaths were not as emotional as it is likely that they will return, but it definitely sets up Avengers 4 nicely with that film expected to end the storylines of the original avengers (Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye). But similar to Drax when he says at the end of GOTG \"Ronan was only a puppet, it's thanos I need to kill\". Fans are left saying \"Infinity War is only part 1, it's really Avengers 4 I need to see\".", "Thonos is the best villain so far. most of characters are useless. Fight between spiderman, Dr. Strange, iron man and Thonos is just great. will recommend to all super hero movie lovers.", "What were you expecting? \nA long review?\nJust watch it already if you've seen at least 6 MCU movies.", "Let me start by saying I am your average viewer who kinda likes super hero movies and doesn't like crap super hero movies. I thought the first Avengers was ok whatever, Avengers: Age of Ultron was super boring. The first Iron man was good, all the others super sucked. Dr Strange was pretty good, and Batman vs Superman was pretty crap, just saying. Now that you have a sense of what I like, please listen.  I was expecting another Avengers movie where I come out thinking ya whatever it was an ok movie, and I don't know what I watch these movies, knowing they usually suck. I am stupid but hey its a movie But after watching this, I very uncomfortable have to say, this is one of the best Avengers, nay best Super Hero movies I have ever seen, Yup I said it, I just cringe saying these words, but I must. Everything in this movie is great, so great that I will say it is the benchmark by which all super hero movie should be made now. Its just soooooooo good, I never thought I would say this about a Super Hero Movie, what have I become, what have you made me into Marvel, what is this feeling WATCH THIS MOVIE, thats it", "If I would have chance t vote twice I would vote for thanos character,\nStrong appearance even he's quite..\nDon't talk much, if he do so, straight to the point..\nEmotional but strong physically and mentally..\nHe knows what he's doing..  Love that kind of characters . I assume thanks would be same in next part..", "10 years and 18 previous Marvel films have led up to this moment. Some of the preceding films were better than others but the ensemble of characters have been established for us nonetheless. Thanos (played by Josh Brolin) is the villain of the piece, and against my expectations, he's actually fleshed out really well as a character. From the fleeting glimpses of him we saw in some of the earlier films, he didn't really leave much of an impression, which caused me to fear that he would be bland and one-note like a selection of some of the other Marvel villains. But, no, he's given depth, motivation and they make him somewhat understandable. So, as the title and premise suggests, Thanos is on an intergalactic conquest to acquire all six Infinity Stones to power his gauntlet so that he can decimate the universe, for the sake of 'balance.' Makes sense in a very twisted way, but he's still a madman. Meanwhile, the Avengers slowly but surely get made aware of the threat and band together, albeit in different groups, relative to their locations and circumstances. Each group have either the possession or the knowledge of at least one Infinity Stone, so Thanos dispatches his minions of the Black Order to retrieve them for him. Also, side note: Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw (Squidward), good god, he is brilliant!! Perhaps I'm biased because I'm also Irish and I loved him in Love/Hate, but he is such an underrated actor. But getting back to the topic of how the story is laid out, and this is one major gripe I had with the film: it is cluttered as hell!! Don't get me wrong, I know how difficult it is to incorporate 20+ main heroes into one film, but the constant jumping back and forth between subplots makes you constantly have to remind yourself what happened to the previous group. The characters work well off one another and there are a couple of funny lines, but some of our heroes were either underdeveloped or out of character. For instance, Star-Lord. I know that he's been shown to be juvenile and immature in a funny way in previous films, but he comes across as an insecure, impulsive joke here. There's a pivotal moment in the film where he single-handedly ruins a plan in motion, that could've ended the threat for our heroes.  The action scenes are fairly decent. The Wakandan battle scene was very well captured, in my opinion. I've probably become desensitized to these superhero action films, merely because of the sheer frequency I've looked at similar looking battles, but for the first time, we're shown a Marvel film with ACTUAL STAKES! No spoilers, but for the last five minutes of the film, my facial expression was frozen to one of absolute shock, which is a first for me. They've given us a decent cliffhanger for the next film, at least. So yeah, generally, it's a competently produced film. The Russo Brothers continue to do a good job in the MCU. The drawback for me was the pacing and the jumping between the different groups. \n(Also, mild spoiler: What the hell was Peter Dinklage doing?! I full-on laughed at every one of his scenes. His accent as that character was ridiculous and kinda ruined my suspension of disbelief) Not the best Marvel film for me, but it's in my top 10, at least.", "Marvel took a huge risk in making this movie and fact that it turned out this great is absolutely phenomenon. Hats off to you Marvel. Job well done for all the directors and the crew that worked on this movie.", "I like these movies because they explain the backstory to most of the main characters. This movie did just that and we loved it! Hope you all go see it and love it as much as we did!!", "I was 13 when I first saw Iron Man in 2008. Now I'm 23. Wow.....", "Third Marvel movie I enjoyed after Iron Man 1 and Thor 1.", "Finally got to see this gem today. The hype was real. I've been a fan of the MCU since its inception and, with the exception of Iron Man 3 and Guardians 2 (and a barely passable \"meh\" with Ant Man), I have thoroughly enjoyed each installment. I was 25 years old when Iron Man first hit theaters and now, 10 years later, the first part of the finale assaulted my senses in the best possible way. Right off the bat, you're presented with dead bodies and a calm voice telling you that you're lucky to be dead. This movie wastes no time in setting the tone. In fact, you could start this film right off from the end credits scene in Thor: Ragnarok.  The trademark MCU humor is present, but it feels toned down. This could be because of the dark and foreboding atmosphere that permeates the film, or maybe because the filmmakers listened to the criticisms of past films and toned down the quipping. Either way, it's refreshing to hear when it comes and feels like a natural extension of the character's personalities. The clash of ego's between Dr. Strange and Tony Stark is especially good. The deaths all have an impact as well. I expected a kind of mass-murder thing, but each on-screen kill takes its time, even for \"lesser\" characters like Heimdall. We get to watch the light leave their eyes or watch them vanish from existence, and it leaves a mark. A lot of people talk about Peter Parker's reaction to being erased from existence and how it tugs at the heartstrings, and they're right in saying so. With all of the powers and abilities, you almost forget that he's a high schooler thrust into a galaxy-spanning battle for universal survival, which is a lot to lay at anyone's feet.  My favorite moments include the return of Steve Rogers, my favorite character. He just looks and is bad-ass throughout the whole film, especially when he joins the Wakandan army to fight off the invasion of Thanos' army (or a part of it) and is the only one that can keep up with a charging Black Panther. It was really cool seeing them sprinting headlong into battle together. I also like how the romantic relationship between Vision and Wanda plays out.  I do want to know what is up with Bruce Banner and the Hulk, though. For some reason, after getting his ass handed to him by Thanos he turns into some kind of coward and refuses to come out. Bruce spends his time in combat in the Hulkbuster suit that beat him in Avengers 2. Also, the end credits sequence teases Captain Marvel being paged by Nick Fury. Where did she come from? How does Nick Fury know about her? I guess these are things that will be revealed in the second installment. I will definitely be viewing this movie again, and it will be very difficult to top. However, the filmmakers must do so to make the epic conclusion to a series over a decade in the making successfully conclude. As Dr. Strange cryptically stated, \"it's the only way\".", "I don't need to add much more than what has already been said so I'll instead sum up the pros and cons of this movie. Pros: \n Cons:\n And that's my review of what is easily the greatest MCU movie, the greatest comic book movie and the greatest movie of 2018.\nCongratulations Marvel/Disney, you have once again shown why you are the juggernaut that you are!\nDC wishes it was you lol :p", "This film has broken me in many ways. But really there is not much to say, i am not going to include the spoilers but can honestly tell you that this time you can believe the hype!", "I loved this Movie saw it twice Both times it was Great", "I wanted to see the second movie right after when i left the premiere one", "I definitely am pleased with how this film developed. I loved the first Avengers movie and was okay with Age of Ultron but this was a home run. Now that the majority of the characters have origin movies, it is like watching a group of friends work together. The dialogue was rapid fire and on point. I am a huge devil's advocate type of person so I see Thanos, the villain, almost as a tortured hero, sacrificing all for what he deems to be the greater good. I know that a loto of people were mad at how it ended but come on people, we knew going in there was to be a part 2 so that had to leave off somewhere. \nI highly recommend this film. It can be a date movie, solo viewing or group outing. Well worth the money and I am ready for the next installment.  FYI not sure if there are really any spoilers but better safe than sorry!", "A superhero movie you deserve to watch, all Marvel whizs out all, exciting and thrilling. Not much I can say, other than please you watch this movie with your family.", "What can you say? I knew it was going to be huge and it truly is. What Marvel did is marvelous tbh. A definite must watch.", "Marvel's Infinity War is the most complex and intense movie of the Marvel Universe. This film with its numerous heros may seem pretty challenging to follow if you're not a hardcore Marvel fan. However, even though there were 19 movies before this one, Infinity War did a fantastic job of bringing all the movies together into a plot that even a first time Marvel movie watcher could understand and enjoy. As said before Infinity War, movie number 19 of this connected movie franchise, has brought all of their heros and movies together seamlessly into an all out war against one very powerful super villain named Thanos. It's very entertaining to see how the groups of heros interact with one another. Black Panther and Captain America gives the viewers someone to look up to and respect. Dr. Strange and Tony Stark's egotistical outlook on themselves really make a good comedic relief between the many intense fight scenes. The biggest comedic relief however comes from the Guardians of the Galaxy ranging from their old music classics, to their funky way of running their operations really gives the audience something to laugh about amongst the chaos, the chaos of course being Thanos. There is so much background to this villain's rise for power so I'll sum it all up for you. Thanos is on a quest to find 6 gems. Each gem, even though they look like something out of a bedazzling kit you got when you were eight, hold very powerful and specific powers that ultimately will let him kill off half of the universe's population. This is the biggest, baddest, and scariest villain yet, not just because his goal is to wipe out half of the universe's populace, but because he is convinced that he is the good guy. He believes that he is doing the universe a favor by making the hard decisions for it. By killing half of the universe, it makes room for more people to have resources and food to go around ultimately leading to the survival of millions of different species. Obviously the Avengers and all the other heros don't agree with this, and tirelessly try to keep the stones away from Thanos. I will not spoil the movie for you but the ending is much more grim than you would expect and leaves you with more questions than answers. That fact may leave some people metaphorically with a bad taste in their mouth, but we must remember that this is the Marvel universe and not everything is as it seems. So in the meantime appreciate the fact the Marvel's Infinity War has the biggest wow factor in the Marvel Universe so far.", "When I first got my tickets for infinity war, I wasn't expecting much, horrible writing, unfunny puns, and a bunch of horrible fights but I got something completely different. to start off the character development Thanos gets is incredible. We get not only his backstory but also the motivation behind his acts and how it affects the story as a whole. something else I really enjoyed about this movie is the fact that is one of the first superhero movies that the villain actually wins. this aspect shows that superheroes do not always win. A great movie totally recommend it!!!", "Feels satisfied of this movie. This one of the greateat superhero movie ever", "Probably best Marvel movie yet to come.... the hole movie is based on one thing and it's thanos and the infinity stone ....every one got their own space the gardens and thor had the most funny part ....captain america and falcon got the serious part .. spider man is hilarious .. Dr.strange is what the mcu was missing ....the ending is a shock giving you a hype for avengers 4", "I did not go into this movie with very high expectations, it looked to me that it would be a mess with all the main characters. I am very happy to say that I am wrong. The way that this film handles all the main characters is great and and did not expect it to be this way. I honestly can't say this is a film, this is more like a three hours of straight climax which is actually done really well. Another thing that this movie does well are the characters themselves. While some characters get more attention then other (for example War Machine gets a lot less screen time than Iron Man), most of the characters are given adequate screen time. One more note about the characters is that Thanos is genuinely the best character in this movie. He gets the most character development of any Marvel villain and any character in this movie. Most of his development in the film is spoilers and I don;t want to deprive anyone of this amazing experience. For those reading this don't spoil the movie for anyone, don't kill the moment some have been waiting ten years for.", "Perfect blend of humour, action, syfy. This was a Marvel of a film (pun intended.) i genuinly believe if a film can make you laugh while keeping you on the edge of your seat pluss add an ending which can leave your heart in your mouth and emotionally involved......you deserve oscars.  All the best films come in trilogy's, I'm sad this is just a double. Only rubish thing about this film is I can't go back and watch it for the first time again Great CGI, great acting, mind blowing story and amazing film.", "A fun film. Undoubedly. The acting was great, the story was very interesting and new, and Thanos is perhaps one of the best movie villains of recent times. Not as good as Joker in 'The Dark Knight', but definitely a villain that all other Marvel villains would now be compared to. The ending, was unseen and surprising, and you did understand Thanos' reasons for doing so (despite them not actually being perfect plans). The only standout performance is Thanos, as this film's main focus is indeed Thanos. As he has not done much but try to look threatening, there was a lot that could've been done, but I'm glad they did what they've done. Despite Thanos being the only standout, all other actors are still excellent even though characters like the Guardians of the Galaxy's introduction to the Avengers didn't drag away from the characters they were built up to be in their own films. Peter Quill wants to be a feared and respected leader but lacks the dominance to properly be threatening. Most characters were given the screentime that was needed, exclutions include Drax and Mantis (although too much of them may have been annoying) and Black Panther among others.  Despite it being a quite long film, it never felt like there was a scene that should've been removed because of results created by every decision made. The cinematography was average, not too many interesting shots, but the 'shaky-cam' didn't get too annoying. Also, the CGI was amazing, but that's to be expected. The music was loud and dramatic but didn't distract myself from the film.", "Avengers: infinity War has been 10 years in the making from easter eggs,references and hints to this very movie throughout all of the MCU and it was all worth it.The Story was well written and thorough,the cast put on good performances,the action scenes were epic,the tone of the movie was one point and it was just an awesome experience. From the beginning of the it starts of with an intense tone,action packed and yet that contained that Marvel humor and this happens consistently throughtout the film almost near to perfection, thanks to The Russo Brothers directing this continuing their success from Captain America:Winter Soldier and Civil war.The first act was amazing as the movie introduced it's characters swiftly and didn't feel rushed at all with some clever writing and stellar action and gorgeous visual effects.Characters like Ironman.Doctor Strange,Spiderman and Thanos are great from the get go.You really felt there was a genuine danger unlike other Marvel films. The second act continued with this momentum as you are introduced to more characters like the Guardians,Captain America and more and the movie expands on the villain's plan and motivation as Thanos was a great villain,the best marvel villain if not then at least Top 3 although his goal was to destroy half the universe which is generic,but the movie clearly explains why he wants to do so and his clear motivations,as Thanos is also intimidating and also rather emotional helped by Josh Brolin's terrific performance as Thanos so is the rest of the cast who do a good job potraying their characters,the best performances coming from Zoe Saldana,Robert Downey Jr,Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen. However since this was a very long movie the pacing was a bit slow and dragged a bit during the second act,but thankfully not too much and i have to say some of the characters from previous movies didn't get as much screen time as others like Captain America or Black Panther which is kind of disappointing their play a minor role in this big superhero film but but that's understandable as there were so many characters in this movie and The Russo Brothers did a fantastic job of balancing each one right even if it mean't some key characters didn't receive a lot of screen time. Also i have to say some minor thing bugged me a little without spoiling to much this arc involving the Hulk and Doctor Strange which doesn't get full explanations only because it's convenient to the plot and some of the humor from the Guardians of the Galaxy characters was a bit much because of James Gunn not being majorly involved with the movie but again this doesn't ruin the movie,just some minor issues,. Now to my favorite part of the film,the last act which was completely bonkers,the actions scenes were wonderful and looked like they came out straight from a comic book,the visuals were dazzling and story accumulated satisfyingly and there was a sense of unpredictability from the movie as the movie was dark,intense yet fun at the same time and the story was left completely wide open for Avengers 4 as it ended with a twist. In the end i think that this is indeed one of the best comic book movies ever made for sure,the best movie of 2018 so far.It had nearly everything heartbreak,a compelling story,some unpredictability,incredible action,fun humor and more and all i have to say if the wait for this movie was totally worth it.", "First, I don't like MCU/DC or any superhero movies, I just watch them for free to waste time. But this movie is one of the boldest movies ever without mercy or holding back. Brutal ending and I loved it! The story - I dont wanna waste brain cells to understand why people asking for a story when you have 100 super hero movies leading up to this movie which is ALL OUT WAR. They fight all the time, its WAR not DRAMA. Understand the genres! Characters - No need for introduction. Each character has its own movie. Go watch them. CGI - mind blowing. Humor - for the very first time there is a good humor and in right place in superhero movie. I had few good laughs. For last - finally they are going to chill on this genre (hopefully) and we can get other blockbusters in genres crushing the cinemas, cause I'm sick of this genre.", "So this is the big one. Ten years in the making, 18 movies in a franchise leading to this. Despite the sky high expectations stemming from the popularity of its preceding films, AVENGERS INFINITY WAR delivers the wide appeal, casual friendly entertainment one has come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe brand. Only that this time, Marvel studios takes it a notch higher. AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is bigger from the get go. The scope is expanded from earth to the entire universe as the alien warlord Thanos' personally expedites his quest to retrieve the powerful infinity gems for his own ends. Gems which are closely tied to the fates of this world's greatest heroes. Through perfectly logical (within the context of the story) means and reasons, the actions of Thanos and his servants end up bringing together heroes from across all the past MCU movies. How does the movie juggle so many characters at once? Well it does so very well. All the characters get a decent amount of time in the spotlight. Half the fun is seeing these characters that you grew to love in their respective movies come together and interact on screen; characters who merely years ago would have no reason to be interacting. Who would have imagined StarLord, whose adventures are at the far end of the cosmos, would be talking face to face with the earth based Iron Man? The cast is perfect in every way with decent chemistry even among those interacting for the very first time on screen. The one thing i really appreciated was the more serious tone, carried on from Black Panther earlier in 2018. A pet peeve of mine has been this obsession with throwing in random quips and comedic moments into the middle of a hectic battle, a tense dialogue or a tension filled face off. This has plagued more than half of MCU movies and all it serves is to trivialise the stakes and destroy any attempt to take the movie seriously. Thankfully, the stakes here are more dire than anything ever seen in the MCU. INFINITY WAR does have witty banter, but this is kept separate from the drama; a very welcome change.  I can safely say that the movie entertains. Its energetic script and fast pace makes the long run time zoom by. There are multiple sub plots but nothing too complex if you are paying attention. The awesome action sequences are finger bitingly intense and the highlight of the entire movie. All this is set to some of composer Alan Silvestri's best musical work yet. S  I can also safely say that this movie is not perfect. As amazing as the action was, some of the fights are just overly choreographed, more like a dance than a fight. Personally, I would have preferred something more raw in the fights.  The story too comes across as a little shallow, especially compared to CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR and BLACK PANTHER which managed to weave in some relevant sociopolitical commentary that generate discussion. INFINITY WAR touches on themes of self sacrifice, and a Machiavellian take on population control, but it never brings those themes front and centre.  Instead what is front and centre is the laughs, the action, the tears, and other simple emotional appeals. The fact that all the characters enter and leave this movie \"as they are\" rather than undergo development through the course of the narrative makes it feel like a season finale to a saturday morning cartoon. Whatever development comes about suddenly in the closing moments rather than organically as the story plays out.  On a whole, I would describe AVENGERS INFINITY WAR as this big reunion party. It sells itself on the experience rather than the story. The experience of a loyal fanbase being rewarded after 10 years of loyalty. The experience of that roller coaster ride through flash CGI graphics all \"woohoo\" and \"yea!\" and being able to enjoy it in the company of like minded individuals. It is a party more than a movie. Who cares about overly convenient events that drive the plot, who cares about unremarkable cinematography and overly hectic action sequences. Who cares about deeper themes, symbolism and narrative depth. It makes me feel awesome. Exactly like a good party.", "For all the people who rated this movie badly, SHAME ON YOU not Marvel. Every movie doesn't have to be a happy ending with shining rainbows all day round. Infinity War has broken the traditions of having good endings. Thanos is the biggest bad-ass in the universe and YOU SHOULD ACCEPT that fact. Infinity War is basically a Star Wars-esque movie and Marvel did it brilliantly. It is called INFINITY WAR, yes WAR for a reason so the pacing is a little bit faster than usual yet cost us more than 2 hours. If you are a true deep-thinking Marvel fan, Infinity War is basically a new beginning of something bigger than itself. Kudos Marvel.", "I think its best movie for avengers!  I am very excited for the next part", "I don't get what all the negative reviews are about. People seem to dislike the elements of homour and/or the length of the film and/or there being too many sidestories to keep up with.  To adress the first critique: This particular brand of humour, with random jokes thrown into the movies to make it more lighthearted, is the whole reason the adaptation of Marvel movies from the comics have transitioned so well the past 10 years. If you look at the movies produced before the whole sucess story of the MCU: X-men last stand, the first 3 Spiderman movies, the fantastic four movie and so on, the one thing they all lacked was the humour. There has to be some kind of humour in superhero-movies, as well as some kind of self awareness, otherwise the movies come of as comletely lame. I mean, we have people in spandex running around and calling themselves pretty corny nick-names - it just can't be all seriousness and action. As for the second complaint, ragarding the running time being too long, I don't think you can cram so many characters into one movie without making it at least 2+ hours long. Otherwise people would just say that it felt rushed instead. Thirdly, I understand if the different characters and plot can seem too much if you haven't really kept up with any of the previous Marvel movies. But if you have, I see no problem in understanding eveything that goes on in the movie. They even make it clearer by writing in text on the screen where the story takes place.  I don't think this is a 10 star movie simply beause it's cut in half, there being a second part and all, but it surely deserves more than a 7 star rating.", "Marvel Studios reaches ten years, in wich we experience great films and also some not good enough. Despite ten years of Marvel movies, Kevin Feige and all his crew make a terrific job in making us love a film in wich we saw all the well known superheroes working together in order to stop te greatest villain in their hole Cinematic Universe.", "Fun isn't something one considers when reviwing movies. But this(Avengers infinity war)... does put a smile on my face.", "Just WOW , The Russo nailed it, hand down from me they did it again. Part by part is interesting to watch , some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones.  One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together.  This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave, brilliant and better than it has any right to be. Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks.  And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible.  For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight.  Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe. Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next. 10/10", "I went to see this movie over this weekend and let e tell ya it was brilliant i laughed i almost cried there was a rush of action and plenty to keep you entertained i totally reccomenmd seeing this movie i only caution sencitive folks that some parts are rather sad but as for everything else i say go see this movie solid ten out of ten", "This movie was nothing more and nothing less than I expected. It was fairly well directed, there were some good performances, it was fun. I was surprised at how good the scoring was, it wasn't great but the music had more of a presence this time around. A great thing about this movie is that now a fight with iron man has stakes, a fight with Thor has stakes, there's a chance someone will die because everyone's got a movie and their contracts are running out so I can actually care. The movie had nice use of colour, nothing was boring to look at, especially in Wakanda. That whole country is pretty cool, it had a nice blend of futuristic things and real African culture. **SPOILERS** If you haven't seen this movie and plan on doing so, stop reading here \nAbout the ending, do you honestly believe that everyone that turned to dust I permanently dead? If you do you're actually retarded or you don't know anything about how this works. Spiderman hada sequel in the world, the guardians have a sequel in the works, black panther had his first movie two months before this one, they will be brought back, this ending means nothing. In conclusion this movie was... good. Wasn't groundbreaking, wasn't hot trash, it was fun.", "I was so excited before watch the movie. After watched the movie, I was freezed, couldn't think of anything else. The best movie I ever watched. I laughed, cried and so much involved. I have never enjoyed any movie like this much. It us must watch film but please at least understand what is going on in previous film before you go to movie, you will definitely love this movie. Please dont miss this awesome experience", "First of all this has to be the best Marvel movie to come out of MCU. Just give it a thought. So many characters to bring on the screen, 150 minutes of runtime. It nevers looks that easy and smooth, right? Well, Russo brothers and Marvel have done an outstanding job to make it possible. During the whole movie, I never felt if any character was underutilized or vice-versa. They have done a fabulous job to fit everyone in the runtime and still keeping it interesting till the very last minute.\nIn most part of the movie, Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order have the upper hand. But there are a few moments in the movie, where you will not just be happy but also have goosebumps. Trust me, Steve Rogers entry in the movie and Thor's entry in the final battle in Wakanda will give you goosebumps. When I was watching the movie, whole theatre turned into a stadium with the chants and roars for these two beloved superheroes.  Now coming to the bad reviews given to this movie. If it was a happy ending, most of the reviewers here who gave less than 5 stars would have appreciated the movie. Considering that Thanos and Infinity Stones story-arc in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going to continue in the Avengers 4, its common sense that this one would not have a happy ending. Also, if you haven't seen any other marvel movies and you just watch infinity war for the hype and buzz, you are not going to like it considering the dark nature of the movie. We all know that there has to be some superhero deaths in the movie to make Thanos look most powerful and baddest villian in the MCU. So if the reviewers here do not like the film, they must have not used their common sense or haven't seen the previous movies of the MCU. I do not want to mention any spoilers here, so I would just like to tell that if you are genuine Marvel fan and have been following the MCU right from the first Ironman movie, then this movie is totally for you. I don't think any Marvel fan would be disappointed with the movie. But if you haven't been following the MCU and are just going to the movie because of all the buzz around you, don't blame it on Marvel Studios or the directors because it's not there fault but yours.", "Constantly on the edge of your seat. Great action and multiple narrative threads.", "It is the best MCU movie in my opinion, it is refreshing, emotional and has a really great villain. It is a wonderful experience", "Now, I'm usually not one to cry during a movie, but dang, this one hit me in the feels. I won't discuss any specific characters that did, but let's just say you'll need to be emotionally prepared before stepping into the theater.", "Entertaining? Reasonably and never completely dull. If you're a big fan of lots of CGI and battles upon battles and displays of \"power\" where one party wins and other loses arbitrarily, you'll have plenty of those. But unlike Thor Ragnarok which just created a fun arcade like environment that didn't take it's material very seriously, understanding it for what it is, this movie does take itself seriously and that's part of the problem.  Thanos is scary. Brolin is a great voice and the CGI is better than good, even if you're reminded in a few places. The problems begin with far too many forced jokes and product placement. It was noticeably awkward at times. Without ruining the film, I will briefly tell you the premise, which in itself was silly and is an example of how the film is reduced to a plot that only kids would buy into if you really want to think about it. The villain wishes to kill half the people in the galaxy to control the population problem in contrast to available resources. Well isn't that brilliant because it will only solve issues for a short time since if 2 beings have 3 children then you've got the same problem all over again. At first I ran with it but, in towards the end, the silliness became apparent. The other glaring weakness. This did not need to be two movies. And it is OBVIOUS what the sequel will contain and how it will resolve. Why? Because it has to in order to generate $$$$$$$$$. Bad move.", "This was the first time in thirteen years I had been to a theatre to see a movie and what movie it was. This is the greatest superhero movie of all time hands down.", "Best marvel movie, and naybe the best superhero movie ever.", "First of all i appreciate both directors who make this movie to next level and really enjoy each and every camera works and also had a good story line up like nolans movie a must watch film for everyone and do watch it on theatre then only u can enjoy the effect of 3d and all last thing is bgm \none of the best bgm ever made", "I just loved it, wonderful movie. Definitely deserves a 10", "I literally cannot stand up or barely move after the end credit, not only because the excitement and stunning I had, but also this movie breaks our heart so badly. When I looked around, most people remained seated with dilapidated faces. I never felt like this after watching movies. The feeling of despair tormenting my heart. Although it is easy to anticipate probably in the next avengers, Time Stone's gonna solve this fading-way-in-the-dust massacre of super heroes, which was definitely shocking and heartbreaking for MCU funs. \n Avengers Infinity War was the great mixture of humor and tragedy. It has a rhythm and I felt like I'm on the roller coaster, as GOG team finally encounters Avengers, Drax and Star-Load bring good taste of jokes and banters exquisitely. A lot of beloved characters die in this movie and that scene is hard to watch, but after those poignant scene, those joke scene follows to alleviate our sorrow.\n In my interpretation, it was the only way to defeat Thanos to give up Time Stone so that Tony Stark can live and this is the vision Dr. Strange saw. \n Anyways this movie has just created a new history, which you can't miss! Anyone who hasn't seen movie yet, just go to the theater.", "Obviously since this is Thanos we're talking about here I knew the first part wouldn't be as much of a happy ending, but I never expected this. There was of course plenty of action packed scenes, comedic relief, and I was surprised with how well they were able to keep the story going while it was surrounded with SO many different characters. So yes, it was one of the most tragic things I've watched (because I grew up in marvel stuff) but it was such a good movie and I'm so ready for the finale!!!!", "Innovative movie. I have waited and theorized for years. The movie was awesome.", "Avengers Infinity war the greatest movie ever I love it so much cant explain Russo Brothers proved that they are the elite directors of this era absolutely the best of the best i mean the action in this movie is out of this world i waited for this movie since i saw Thanos at the end of the Avengers and it totally worth the wait this movie will and mean WILL drop your jaw my heart was pumping so hard three times faster than normal and i am gonna see this movie hundred times again cant wait .", "No spoilers. Only the truest of Marvel haters or incompetent reviewers would give this movie anything less than a 8. Everything you could want in a superhero film. The baddest heroes vs the absolute baddest villain. Need I say more?? Watch it and be amazed..... This movie was a true spectacle and brought out tons of varying emotions in viewers. The theatre I went to was packed and every one in their loved it! Everyone!", "This movie was perfect from start to finish. Waited 10 years for this big moment between the Avengers and Thanos. Was not disappointed. Had the perfect balance between suspense, drama, and humor. Can't wait for Avengers 4 next year.", "I can't remember the last time I was so hyped for a film like this. Probably back in 2008 with the release of The Dark Knight. Well, ten years later here I was doing the same routine. Watching trailers over and over, avoiding all possible spoiler news about the film, and aching to watch it on opening day. Finally, the wait was over and I finally watched the film. While, I still don't think its my personal favorite Marvel film despite expecting it to be, the film is overall a very good film despite its different tone. Furthermore, there are no plot spoilers in this review, there may be thoughts but no real spoilers. The film is the next installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which sees the Titan, Thanos, on a serious quest to find the Infinity Stones. The various stones let him control basic aspects of the world and make him powerful. The collection of all of them could change the universe drastically and make him the decider of anything that occurs Of course, The Avengers and surrounding heroes make it a mission to stop him and so we see our heroes unite (and split up) to attempt to take down this force that is unlike anything they've ever seen before. There are a few negatives of the film but nothing that really bring down the quality of it so much. I think the Russo brothers did a generally good job of doing this ambitious crossover combining many characters from different films. However, some do not get enough screen time. Its nothing crazy, but it was expected. There are a lot of humor moments, most hit but not all. That might bother some of the viewers wanting less of that. Also, there are some major plot points that were dumb and questionable, not getting into it though. I highly appreciated Josh Brolin as Thanos. One weakness of previous Marvel entries was a weak or generic villain. Finally we have one with a well fleshed out back story and one that is unpredictable. Thanos is legitimately threatening and you feel scared for the superheros when he is on screen. There are some moments that feel emotional and it ropes you in well. I feel like the tone and nature of this film is darker than anything in the MCU which I liked. Finally, things feel like they have consequences. The battles are for the most part fun and what you expect. The film is definitely incomplete because it was shot together with the next Avengers. I have a lot more to say but feel worn out, in a good way. The real strength of Infinity War is being able to see characters you love interacting with one another. Ten years of films, were all leading to this and you can tell the filmmakers but a lot of effort and heart into it. It won't please everyone and does come with flaws and complaints but I think its an event that every comic book fan has to see in the theaters. I am ready for the hype for the next Avengers. 8.5/10", "We've spent ten years with Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe. Whether you think it's a groundbreaking character driven story or a corporate cash cow, the MCU has managed to not only adapt the famous comics of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (yes, I know there were a lot more people involved, so let's say all of those creative artists and writers of Marvel), but has managed to change how super heroes are seen on the big screen. They can have grey lines, they can be anti heroes, they can have moments where they don't even trust the government. I've personally love the MCU movies and will keep coming back to them to see where our heroes end up next. Ever since The Avengers, the MCU has been teasing the upcoming villain Thanos. He had spent a good chunk of these movies on a throne, hoping that one of his minions can acquire certain stones, such as the power stone in Guardians of the Galaxy and the reality stone in Thor: The Dark World. Time has finally come for the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to team up in the major crossover event movie that is Avengers Infinity War.  What I won't do is list all the actors, but I'll give a brief look at the story without going into spoilers, as much of the film's enjoyment is what you don't know. We open on Thor's ship where Thanos and his children has caught up with them and have acquired a couple of the stones. Thanos understands that if he can collect the rest of the stones for the gauntlet, he'll have the power to control the universe, time, and the fate of every living creature within his grasp. A last ditch effort sends Hulk/Bruce Banner back to Earth where he meets up with Dr. Strange, Iron Man/Tony Stark and Spider-Man/Peter Parker.  Meanwhile, Thor manages to get a distress call out where the Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Racoon, Drax, Groot, and Mantis, respond. Their fully aware of the danger that Thanos possesses and agree to help. Back on Earth, Vision and Scarlet Witch are attacked by Thanos' children, but saved by Captain America/Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Falcon/Sam Wilson who all sense the danger. They make it to Wakanda to meet up with T'Challa/Black Panther. Together, all of these heroes end up in different areas as they try to stop Thanos from getting the rest of the Infinity Stones. While Avengers Infinity War has a lot to live up to, I decided to not keep my expectations too high as I know that this is a tough movie to pull off. The good news is that I was very happy with what I got. You get your favorite superheroes and a lot of action that's warranted from the film's villain and his scary desire. I'll start off with. Josh Brolin finally gets to shine as one of the most complex villains of the MCU (which has not had a good track record of villains). The heroes face a villain who is genuinely scary, thanks to several scenes of them fighting which I won't spoil and a lot of his view of the universe, which I also won't spoil. He is beyond powerful, smart, and does have a moral compass; just not a traditional one. We get more time with him and his relationship with Gamora and just what his children mean to him compared to the bigger picture. The other villains too, prove to be powerful, even if their not as memorable. It's made up with their overall impression of worship and how a lot of that driven emotion can generate into persuasion. For a movie with a lot of characters, Avengers Infinity War has a lot of work juggling them. I'd say that one of the bigger flaws is that the editing around that is not done well. It'll spend a good twenty five minutes in space with dazzling effects, but then suddenly cut back to Earth in Africa. While we definitely see the consequences for the heroes, it doesn't give us enough at how the rest of the world would deal with such a threat. Why couldn't have more of the marvel heroes from ABC and Netflix also get involved? I can't blame them for this, but the movie might have benefitted from being longer, making the editing of the longer sequences feel justified. I'll give this eight Infinity Gauntlets out of ten. I think most Marvel fans will be happy with the movie and the surprises it throws (yep, there are a lot of them here). If your not as well read and haven't seen the other movies, I'd recommend watching the other Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange first. Again, I was happy with everything, given that I wasn't asking for too much. More might have been done to really make this an epic masterpiece like Ben Hur, but for a lot of people, this will be a Marvel to sight.", "This was a blast. more than an avengers flick as most of superheroes were in like guardians of the galaxy and black panther and others. only the justice league were not there so to have a complete superheroes mixture.  finally they understand that we are sick of useless videogame action effects.\n sure there were a lot of such scenes in the film but not as much as u would expect.  2/3 of the film was character development and full of emotion and plot story and only a third was about war and not all of those scenes were mindless action.\n compared to the previous avengers films this was a huge improvement in this matter.\n I remember the first film was a total failure as it was a boring action videogame.\n watch the first film and then this one and see the huge difference in everything.  this film had it all even humor. at times it was more of GOTG movie than an avenges movie.\n story kicked ass as thanos tried to get the stones ending the world but the best part is the ending.\n no one could tell what would happen. finally we got a realistic kind of sad ending but finally they tried something different than he usual end where always the good guys win somehow.  all in all it was quite a timed before I really enjoyed a marvel film like this one.  best film of the year so far.  grade // A", "I was afraid at first, the MCU movies are often not as great as they were in past times, but boy was I satisfied. I found little of the things I dislike in super hero movies, instead I found (finally) interesting dialog and action sequences more unique than others. This was not your typical boring \"city destroyed by someone\", it was more unique and differently choreographed and I definitely enjoy the action sequences. Don't get me wrong, I personally disliked some things, but over all I was pleasantly surprised by a fun movie going experience instead of another predictable super hero movies. I am normally disappointing by super hero movies, but this one held me more than most, and its definitely well above average as far as MCU is concerned. The humor was also really ood and not corny like previous MCU movies, but I'll explain why later. So I said what I liked and I will say more, but lets talk about what I didn't like. First of all, I wasn't a fan of Captain America's beard, especially since he's my favorite, but thats my personal opinion. Without giving to much away, I didn't like the alterations to Spiderman's suit. Also I didn't like how they re-wrote The Hulk's condition. In canon, it happens when he gets angry, but now suddenly The Hulk side decides whether or not he shows up, as if choosing what type of angry will trigger him. I LOVED the additions of the Guardians of the Galaxy to the Avengers movies, the truly brought their specific type of humor to the film and I thoroughly enjoyed it, they fit in so perfectly and added a new style to the series. All in all it was much better than the average MCU film, and I would recommend it to people who now dislike super hero movies.", "As we all know that this movie is going to be a Huge Surprise for everyone.\nAll the story telling relates and holds our attention till the end and I am very happy to see it on first day first show which is one of the best feeling in the world as you have no idea what is going next and I can not explain how many goosebumps I have in this movie. There some scenes that will blow your mind. This is the only time that I have seen that everyone is yelling at each and every scene in the theater. I have watched this movie in IMAX 3D which is best and I only recommend everyone to see this movie in IMAX because it tells much more. I am a Huge fan of Marvel Movies and I can say that this is the Best Movie till date and I am expecting that they will make upcoming movies more and more entertaining.", "I saw avengers infinity war last night and I had to pick my jaw off the floor. While this movie is huge and filled with some amazing hereos it should actually be named Thanos: infinity war. While it mainly follows thanos on his journey we see just how powerful, and intimidating he is. The Russo brothers had high expectations for this movie and they delivered. This movie is too big to just see once, good thing I'm seeing it again tonight!", "This film, by a universal account, is the best Marvel film I have ever seen. To start off, I am a fair critic of film, and I cannot say that I have full enjoyed each Marvel film, however this one does not fall in that category. The promotional aspect of this movie falls very short in how amazing Avengers Infinity War actually is. The performances were stellar, the action was an achievement, cinematography will blow your mind, and you will be shocked over and over again. You will laugh, your will cry, you will truly enjoy this amazing film. Thanos is given a dynamic the likes of which I have never seen in that character, and I was completely glad to see how they were able to bring him to life on the big screen.  If you've been waiting for this film to come out, wait no longer. Go see Avengers Infinity War, and mark yourself a proud fan and filmgoer. This will be one that cinematic history, and marvel history will not soon forget!  Best Marvel Film to date!", "The movie is great l loved I was waiting for a long time ppl will prolly say the ending was bad it wasn't it was just a cliffhanger so that they can make the movie avengers 4 more interesting", "Very mild spoilers only. I feel like I've been hit with Thor's hammer. This colossal, ambitious, terrifically engaging movie literally took my breath away. And not because of the awesome action scenes (and they are awesome). But because of the heart and soul the film puts out there. This is mainstream cinema at its very best. The cast are all great. But Josh Brolin is absolutely fantastic as Thanos. He banishes forever the accusation that Marvel villians are not up to much. Chris Hemsworth's Thor is astonishingly awesome in this movie. Whereas The Hulk was the go to guy for gigantic damage in the original Avengers, here it's the Golden-haired. \n Avenger. And boy is he angry. Hulk, however, is largely absent, even if Bruce Banner is not. No Hawkeye too, although it is explained why he's missing. I walked out of the cinema shell-shocked. How brave of Marvel Studios to do this, to really, really go for it. And they did. Thank you Russo Brothers. This movie has passion and impact in a way that even the best of the previous Marvel movies does not. Marvel's bravery is to be commended. In many ways this is darkest film they have ever done. I do think there will be a reset button somewhere along the line. And yet it's also very funny. The writer/directors juggle the tonal changes (and there are many) like master magicians. Thank you guys,. There are plenty of plot twists, and almost all of them are suprising. Just do yourself a favour - ignore the DC trolls (dead universe breeds spite) and go and see this. The culmination of a great cinematic event. And prepare for that blow from Mjolnir.", "Very well done movie\nTense\nGripping \nFun \nClear \nExciting  My only real critique is that there were moments that were meant to be very emotional that kinda fell flat. But that wasn't enough to make it a bad movie. If you like Marvel at all, watch this movie. You won't regret it.", "Action packed movie that seems like it was an hour long", "Best marvel movie so far. \nMust watch.\nTwist at end was super good.", "Just got out of watching this movie in Imax 3d and although I love this film, it will have some negativity simply because it involves so many characters and only 2hr 36 minutes to tell the story. Ok let's start, the first act starts at a frantic pace just after the events of Thor Ragnorak and we instantly find out Thanos malevolent intentions, he wants all the 'infinity stones' to balance the Universe by wiping out half the Universe's population. After this showstopping first Act we are whisked off to New York where Dr Strange meets Spiderman and Iron Man for the first team closely followed by Hulkless Dr Banner. Thanos, Knowing that Dr Strange and vision has two of the stones on earth first heads to 'knowhere' from the GOG franchise to pick up the third stone from the collector drawing out Gamorra who is critical to the main and sub plot of the film, after using the reality stone to defeat The GOG he now tries to locate the 4th stone, the Soul gem which is hidden to all but one, before he will venture to earth to collect the final 2 stones. Thanos sends his children , 'The Black Order' to locate and find the two stones while he searches for the most difficult. During this rollercoaster of a ride that at times feels so similar to the cut scenes of the DC injustice movie, Thor meets the Guardians, then with Rocket and teenage Groot journies to the planet of the Dwarves to forge a new hammer called \"Stormbreaker\". All this is happening while Capt, Falcon, Black Widow rescue Scarlet Witch and Vision from the black order and then seek refuge with War Machine in Wakanda. \n Also concurrently in the film we see Iron Man, Spider Man and Dr Strange hitch a lift to Titan, homeworld of Thanos where they meet the GOG all intent on stopping Thanos reaching Earth to collect the final 2 stones. Ok as you can see the plot is so fast there is no time to pause for breath and this is where some of the critics will have a field day but the film achieves its goals with brilliant pacing, fight scenes, special effects and great moments for all our heroes and villains alike and some stunning shocks that leave you gasping and exhilarated both at the same time. The ending is brilliant but you know especially with the aftercredits scene that the franchise simply can't end this way so Avengers 4 will be another must watch movie!! \n Joss Brolin is rightly getting plaudits for his portrayal of a wonderful villain but for me, he's only the 2nd best in the MCU, behind Killmonger and still a distant 3rd in Comic book movies behind Heath Ledger's Joker, netherless his brilliant emotional arc of the character and in paticular Thanos relenting unerving motivation is what elevates the film to top 5 in the MCU behind Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Avengers 1 and Civil War. My only criticism is I wish there was more Wakanda in the movie but it does host the one of the best battle scenes witnessed on the big screen.", "Hello there , after seeing Avengers Infinity War this morning I felt I had to share a fraction of my enthusiasm for this movie. It's a rare thing indeed that a movie lives up to its hype , how often have you went to the cinema only to discover that the best parts are all in the trailer ? Well, fear not , because this is the best Marvel movie so far. The first 5 minutes are awesome and hooks you straight away but hang on because this is truly a roller coaster ride that just speeds up from this point. Whilst some people might worry that at 2 hours 20 , this may be a bum-numbing experience , but rest assured , this movie flies over all too fast and leaves you wanting more . One major advantage this super hero film has over the rest is the main villain, Thanos. This is the first time I can actually remember a murderous tyrant having a rational reason for destroying half a galaxy and Josh Brolin's performance is nothing short of incredible. Seriously , go see this movie NOW before someone reveals the many great scenes or plot twists - YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED !!!!!.", "So just why was it as I believe everything that we, the fans of the Marvel Universe could ask for, we finally got to see the separate bands of heroes work together and although it was inevitable, it was orchestrated that well that we would struggle to find issues with it. Even looking at it from the view of your general film spectator it had all the key aspects you would look for in a great film from Comedy to a feeling of sadness towards characters (even thanos himself) as well as Action to Mystery.  With many critics and even fans thinking the series would struggle to sustain itself with it being such a large series of films thus far, Marvel have once again pulled it out of the bag to produce one of the best live action comic book movies of it's time.", "Wow! Just, wow!! Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building up to this movie for ten years. This movie is glorious. All I can say is, you will not be expecting what happens. It left me screaming inside. I still cannot believe it. The storyline is about the Avengers and their allies needing to team up to stop the titan Thanos from collecting The Infinity Stones and destroying half the universe.  Now, because all the Marvel characters are finally coming together, Marvel fans will obviously be excited. And when basically every single character appears on-screen, the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy. I always love it when a studio or company can make people feel such excitement for their characters. It's just really cool.  This movie features lots of different locations that the characters travel to. I must admit, some of these locations are absolutely gorgeous and others, totally desolate, but still incredible. I love the shots in space and on different planets, especially the snowy planet that Thanos goes to at one point. In fact, the whole movie looks fantastic. Everything - from the costumes, the camera angles, the scale, the special effects - everything! I was so invested in the visuals the entire time.  Also, let's be honest, this is Marvel, we all expect this movie to be absolutely hilarious. And it is. No surprises there. I laughed so hard at Iron Man and Doctor Strange arguing, Star Lord being jealous of Thor and basically all of Spider Man and Drax's dialogue. Comedy always seems to be Marvel's greatest strength. The writing, in general, is fantastic. I love the interactions these characters have, even the dramatic moments. That's coming from someone who usually hates dramatic moments, because I hate being sad in movies.  This is a superhero movie, so obviously there are some pretty cool action scenes. And yeah, this movie has some awesome action scenes. Probably my favorite is the huge fight in Wakanda that is shown in the trailer. The fight is absolutely massive and straight up amazing. The shots and the way the characters work together are just glorious. I felt so immersed in all the action. Since this movie is connected to the other Marvel movies in their Cinematic Universe, there is the possible question about whether you need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one. I would say, not all of them, but at least a few certain ones. I recommend that you brush up on your Marvel characters before you go, just to be ready. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, as it gets pretty dark.  Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.", "Many complaints about lack of character development, when it seems that many have been missing the biggest development of all: Thanos.  Infinity War is a film about an antagonist, not a villain. Thanos is a tsunami - a wave of destruction with no preference or ideology - with no mercy.  Our superheroes have had their development through the 100+ hours of origins and sequels, so it's no disappointment or surprise to see the Avengers \"assemble\", and simply \"get on with it\", and after everything, we still with part II to come and conclude this epic. But for now, this is about Thanos and his story, everyone else is in the background as Josh Brolin dominates the role.", "\"Avengers Infinity War\" arrives, after 10 years. Everything the fans wanted to see is here, from grand battles to exciting moments. Finally seeing all the characters built over so long is rewarding. Thanos is scared and powerful, becoming Marvel's best villain. Stop what you're doing and go see \"Infinity War\" is a very fun and epic experience, and the end will leave everyone waiting for Avengers 4!", "I watched painfully as my childhood started to break piece by piece, hero by hero. This is a film that will live in our hearts, in our mind as one of the most (maybe even the most) emotionally intense movie we will ever see. That night I did not sleep as I was so broken inside. This movie lives up to the hype and gives us even more than what we ask for. We do not deserve this movie. But it does deserve us, as in front of me I saw a group of 3 friends which were dressed up as: Nebula, Star-Lord, and Cap (and also a grumpy lady which threw me popcorn as my friend teased her). This is the best MCU, maybe even SUPERHERO movie that exists. 10 years of movies leading up to this. This does not happen regularly.", "I was very impressed with AIW. It has restored my faith in Cinema as an immersive experience after the debacle that was TLJ, which I know some loved but overall it was a let down after all the hype. Again the critics loved this one but as many TLJ customers didn't I tried to not get my hopes up.  Put simply, it is awesome.  AIW starts at a relentless pace and does not really let up. There are times when the galaxy hopping gets a little annoying but considering the cast of main characters everyone gets their moment and the story is pulled together exceptionally well. There is definite peril in this one. Our heroes are up against it and each knows they may not get out alive Having learned from Ragnarok, there is plenty of humour and it is delivered at the right times to great effect (one area where TLJ was awful). Despite this being a bang, crash, wallop blockbuster there is plenty of character depth and some superb acting. Peter Parker / Tony Stark anyone! Even the backstory to Thanos may even have had you rooting for him a little. (He is still an insane galactomaniac!) Anyone who goes to see this and doesn't genuinely enjoy the experience is dead inside. Is it the best film ever, maybe not but it is certainly up there as one of the most enjoyable 2 1/2 hrs I've had in a cinema. Marvel have nailed this front and centre. I will be really surprised if this doesn't go on to be the highest grossing movie of all time.", "I watched the movie yesterday and it was just beyond my expectations. I didn't expect this ending, it just broke my heart. The story was told very well and thanos was portraid and explained great! It was just his movie and his quest to collect all the infinity stones. I just had the idea at the ending that only the first avengers were left over. But there were also some other people left alive. But at the end the movie gets a big 10 from me!", "A moment to rejoice! Welcome to Phase 3 of the MCU. First things first, clever writing from the Russo brothers. After a long time (since Spidey's Homecoming) the critics are totally in sync with me. Last month I watched Black Panther, and thought it was media-hyped! But today, I found something refreshing. This is the best Avengers assembly ever made! I watched A:IW in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the galaxy, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a slight chopping of the picture. The images are larger than life. Although they don't confuse the eye but I am still having a strain. Along with 12,000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing! It may have taken 10 years and 18 movies, but the superheroes have shown redemption. This may have room in the hall of fame! Spider-man is just a teenage boy but yes,Tony Stark can convince any one and it was watching both of them together again. Thor appreciates Roger's beard. And the suits even support the tone of the film. Some people in the theater started crying in the end, but I didn't. I don't want to spoil anything, so save your bucks for this blockbuster. Expect a few BO records to be broken and don't forget to watch the end credits.  My significant digit score: 8.5/10", "This is what you waiting for all this years, great plot, one thing I would like to see diffrent, the black order they should be more powerful but that's a detail, Thanos is the best villan so far.", "The movie blow my mind and it is beyond my expectation. Just go and see it for yourself. It is just that good that it makes me write my first movie review in my entire life.", "Watch it. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You won't be disappointed", "A must see blockbuster that will make you laugh, shocked, silent, and tear up!", "As a fan of comics my whole life, one must have long ago come to the understanding that adaptations fro mone form of media to another are never going to come close to capturing the nostalgia and true impact that came before.\n Though I have been pleased enough to see Marvel revitalized with the films of the last almost 20 years, to me, and no doubt countless die hard comic fans out there, the Marvel Cinematic Universe falls short of greatness, occupying a slot just below the somewhat lackluster Ultimate line of Marvel titles.\n A never impressive Hulk, a sickening to behold Thor, a HUGE lack of characters that are mainstays of Marvel comics, but have, like with the trend in comics themselves, been retconned out of films, the avengers series are okay at first, but lose value after rewatching but a few times.\nEnter the most pathetic Thanos this side of a poorly written What IF issue.\n( Dont get the reference? Well too bad, go read some old comics ya posers)\nThanos, voiced by Josh Brolin, sounded less booming and profoundly intimidating than the \"Mad Titan\" should have. Also quickly doing away with Thanos' armor in lieu or undergarments that make it seem like he just came from the gym, brah, and way too much emphasis on Thanos being overly emotional, and not that bad a fella, I felt myself getting sick through some of the film. Alongside what seemed like a very rushed story, even for the first of a two parter, there should have been more meat to the bones of this film considering how few big league heroes were actually present. But it seems this was kinda glazed over with the multitude of second string characters introduced in the VERY recent Black Panther film ( and perhaps that was partially the intent upon its own release). \nStill the nostalgia was more palpable than all the other films combined, which was no doubt Disneys intention so as to best satiate the lust for that bygone era of comic sanctity that so many have longed for. Seeing a few of the avengers mish mashed, with different hair colors, or a bear, or lack thereof, almost added some much needed character depth, but was too obvious a ploy to be convincing of how hard times had lead to even harder ones. \nAt least the jeers, tears, and reactions of people in the theater, comprised of many age groups, was sufficient enough to swing me toward a more moderate positive vote.\nInfinity war had a decent amount of action, emotion, but still felt too forced.\nSo for nostalgias sake, I can give this no more than a 7/10. Enjoy, but Brolin will likely do better( not saying much) as Cable in the upcoming Deadpool 2...>,;,<", "This avengers movie takes it to the next level then all the other ones. All the avengers are in a race to get the infinity stones before thanos gets all of them. Thanos is the best villain in the avengers movies so far. And how powerful and dominant he is. And just how powerful anyone can be with even just one stone. At the end thanos gets the last infinity stone and then snaps his fingers so the population declines by 50% This movie was all around great and just shows how good this movie is", "This may arguably better than the 1st Avengers movie, depending on who you ask. The ending made me sad, the Wakanda battle had all the action I wanted. It also had all the laughs it needed.", "Love Marvel Universe, love iron man, love the star baron who hit the double 4 with one punch, love the big hawk eyes that didn't appear, and loneliness, but in fact, it's the extermination of hegemony that many people's hearts portray, love all superheroes, marvel for ten years, the hero is immortal!", "Despite Avengers being a Marvel commercialism and attempting to unite all these characters into a cohesive narrative, the movie does a good job of integrating them in a way that it does not feel forced or expendable. They all have their little cameo and do not have excessive presence that creates random and out of place scenes. I mean it somewhat does, but it is bearable. What makes this movie stand out above all superhero movies - except the Nolan's Batman Trilogy - is the deep meaning and implications of the clash of ideologies between Thanos and the Avengers. Thanos follows a narrative of a redeemer, a godly presence, coming to restore order in the universe. He is not a sadist; he even feels burdened by this purpose. At a certain instance he confesses: \"I ignored my destiny once, I cannot do that again\". He is one of the most humane villains I have seen in any movie. He is willing to risk everything to get the six infinity stones and reduce as much as possible the suffering of people by just snapping his fingers and disintegrating everyone. Simply Thanos wants to maximize the pleasure of all living beings by reducing population and providing everyone the resources for a happy existence, instead of what he perceives a chaotic and damaging organization of living beings. The dialogue is adequate: The avengers are continually given a chance to demonstrate their uniqueness and role. The directors gave them dialogue to express their idiosyncrasies and personality, and it was entertaining to watch the usual quips and jests by Iron Man or the Guardians of the Galaxy. Even though the movie was two hours and thirty minutes the movie never felt dull, and the inclusion of new scenes always had a purpose in the major plot. Maybe the movie had too many action scenes for my personal preference, but maybe I am asking too much from a Marvel film. Thanos achieving his goal the way he did was definitely a surprise, and I feel like I don't get surprised that often in films, so Kudos to the Directors for raising the tension repeatedly, and instead of, like in most movies, the superheroes achieving their goal we had a very spiritual, multi-faceted villain that accomplished his goal. I have to say that Thanos continually justified being a worthy villain to face all the avengers.", "I have seen many films when there is so much unnecessary action ,but in this film all the action is necessary - which makes the film so good.", "What imbecile was responsible for that final battle scene? Permeated with tactical errors, the final battle in the fictional world of Wakanda has got to be the most teeth-gnashingly horrible battle put to screen. Honestly, this makes Return of the King's Osgiliath battle look like genius. Let's look into the what mistakes they made. The location: The battle takes place in a fictional country protected by a force-field shield (think Gungun army from Star Wars), inside the circular shield is a city in the middle with grassy plains around it, but still inside the shield. The battle started with the enemy troops landing outside the shield and being forced to walk through onto the grassy field. Apparently the Avengers decided to meet them there, on a flat, wide plain where the numerical advantage of the enemy would work most to the hero's disadvantage leading them to be easily encircled and slaughtered. The Avengers do not take advantage of the city's walls and mounted cannons we can clearly see behind them, nor do they use any aerial fighters excluding the ones among them who can fly; no planes or helicopters are used, nor is there a reason given as to why not. The weapons: I have already stated the moronic absence of aerial superiority, but that is not the end of it. Despite being an advanced culture facing a haphazard mob of monsters armed with nothing but fists and teeth, the Avenger's army is outfitted for the most part with spears, swords, and shields. There IS one smart guy in the group, Bucky Barnes, who systematically machine-guns down the enemy without letting them get near him. That was the smart thing to do, but the rest of the heroes charge the mob head on, allowing the enemy to take the most advantage of their weapons (fists and teeth). The organization: The Avengers don't have any battle plan or trap of any kind; the plan as far as I can figure is \"Go get them!\". There is no formation of any kind, besides a homogenous mass of soldiers charging en masse into the arms of the enemy. Why this is, we don't know. The scale: One thing that catches attention of this battle is that the Avengers treat it as the battle for the dominion of the earth. Indeed, if the enemy were to win, half of the universe's beings would be wiped out of existence. But if this battle was indeed so important, why wasn't any nations army there? Granted the US government would be skeptical sending troops over to an African country to help spandex sporting soldiers, but as seen in Captain America Civil War the Government DOES take the Avengers seriously and would likely do even more after a giant spaceship appears above Manhattan previously in this film. I digress. Having only a platoon of Marines could dramatically alter the battle, what with machine guns and explosive grenades. Heck, the enemy army could be wiped out without even reaching the city walls using a couple Apache helicopters armed with miniguns and rockets. Once again, these enemies are armed with only fists and teeth; any ranged weapons such as guns would completely wipe out any charge without a casualty. (There's a reason WWI ended mass charges, it was a bloodbath whenever someone tried). Somehow drug cartels can get mounted machine guns, but \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" can't? Just imagine what modern tanks and a squad of heavy-machine gunners could do to Thanos's pathetic army. The decisions: The orders given during the course of battle by the Avengers are also failures. When the monsters begin to force their way into the shield and encircle the Avengers. In response to this, the Avengers order to open a portion of the shield to center the enemy's forces so they can kill them better. Now a more successful tactic would be to maintain the shield and retreat to the city, killing any of the enemy that make it to the walls, as only a couple enemies get through the shield and it can be seen that walking through the shield burns and amputates the monsters. However, if one does want to open the shield, it would be better to open and closing it systematically, using a military tactic known as \"Defeat in Detail\". This tactic allows smaller armies to defeat much larger armies. In this case, the shield would open, letting a small portion of the enemy army into the inner circle, and then close it, trapping a small army against the Avenger's much larger one, allowing the Avengers to slaughter the enemy with near no casualties. This could be repeated as many times as long as there is still an enemy army standing. Oh yeah, and don't even bring up the extremely powerful superpowers that some of the heroes use once and never again. And Tony Starks Nanotech is the stupidest thing I have seen in one of these movies by far, and they don't even try to hide it's CGI.", "This movie is dope and insanely good. I love how the characters clearly portray the role that is given to them", "After the Thor ragnarok ending. Thanos is on his hunt for Infinity stones. Avengers are split up and without plan. Thanos has a plan, and a great one. Thanos is ready to sacrifice, but the Avengers arenot. Thanos snaps completing his destiny and removing half the life. This movie is about Thanos and all the setup that was set for him in Infinity Saga. Thanos is right in his conscious and is just watching the sunrise at his Garden!. He justifies the role of character. Black order is weak. They couldve been more fierce.\nYou have to deal with emotions and the deaths.\nThis shows if you have a plan, execution and will you can do anything. and also when to strike the enemy (at their weakest) and till now they havent lost and when they lost, they lose big time.!", "This has to be the best Avengers film. I love them all, but the ending of this one leaves you on edge which I LOVE!", "Infinity War... where to start with this one. Opening night was something spectacular for me when it came to this film. I went in with the same anticipation I had for most Marvel movies- which is to say excited but not expecting anything more than good. I am so glad that what we got rose above that threshold to be something I will never forget. From the very start the film grips you by putting the focus almost entirely on Thanos as it's central figure and killing off characters that were just saved only a movie ago in Thor: Ragnarok. This cold open was enough for me to be sold on Thanos as a character and the film enhances him more and more as it goes on. I have to give huge props to Marvel for letting the Russos, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Marcus be more impactful with this movie and it was well worth the hype. The action scenes carry the movie and are all well thought out, engaging, and creative to the big screen. Not one scene is wasted and the forward momentum keeps you enticed. Alan Silvestri- what a comeback for his time with the MCU. He had previously only scored Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers before being dropped in favor of other composers for the next few projects. Him being back on for Infinity War gives the movie a score that enhances it's operatic weight to heights I did not expect. I knew his score would be great but so many moments are made by the music alone. The triumphant Avengers theme playing at the beginning as I had hoped since Age of Ultron was satisfying and the ending, that ending, was film score perfection. One of the best end credit suites to most recent blockbusters. Another thing that was striking was the Russo's approach to color in this movie as most Marvel movies all share the same 2010 gritty bland-gray look and take away from some of the fun costumes. This time around they nailed the look, allowing for scenes to pop with their greenscreened backgrounds by having the sets lit identically to how they wanted them to look on film. One of the biggest achievements of this movie was Thanos himself and all the VFX work that made him believable. That's extremely commendable but has done so too many times and I would rather praise the great VFX and artwork in general. The sound design and CGI blend to create a cosmic comicbook world that looks like something straight out of a conceptual artbook. There are tiny details in every VFX shot that sell these characters' interactions and action beats. Iron Man's nano armor was a stand out and the great colors of Nidavellir contrast the rest of the film to sell the third act. The ending is what made this movie as big as it is- the heroes lose, what's not to love about that? It felt like The Empire Strikes Back for this franchise and a true epic finale to every story we had been presented so far. Getting to see these characters beat down was satisfying and had some of the most poignant scenes in the end. The infamous porch scene is a standout and is incredibly memorable- and daunting. No one was prepared for this and it made this movie all the more special. There is so much more to say about Marvel's greatest achievement (in my opinion) but I think most of it has already been said. This is my favorite superhero movie of all time and I don't see any other topping it any time soon.", "What a movie! This movie is exhilarating. The excitement never ends. Extremely well-crafted, with awesome characters, jokes, and action. One of the greatest endings I've ever seen in a movie.", "I love this movie the first time I see in the theater it was like WOW all the heroes together except Ant Man And The Wasp but they appearance in Avengers Endgame I love it. The first scene of the movie it was one of the biggest scenes of all time for me CONGRATULATIONS!!!", "This movie is better than the first I like the part when thanos and the hulk fight in the beginning", "This for me is the best of all the Avengers movies. What makes it is the character of Thanos, he is not an out an out bad guy but somebody who sees what hes doing is for the good of the universe. Added to this is that he has strong feelings and compassion. End game just doesn't have this aspect. I think the ratings for this is right, for me the plot has a few flaws and some CGI is a little off but that's it, so close for a 10 for me. But unlike some great films you can watch this one a few times.", "The hero's are outmatched and the arrival of Thanos lives up to all the hype. 2nd best film of the MCU.", "Thanos' quest to find all the Infinity Stones and his mission was what made him a greater villain than any other from the past Marvel movies.", "Thanos was on a mission, and it was a terrifying one. The way Josh Brolin carried the Thanos character made the movie very awesome.", "This movie was so jam-packed with story, dialogue, and events that calling it a movie might be an understatement.", "The Russo brothers did a great job of making this movie a great one.", "Honestly, what made this movie truly spectacular and unique was the writing and the pacing which will keep you wanting more.", "I thought it would be more mediocre, but in the end, I can say that the whole movie was breathtaking and definitely lived up to its hype.", "This is the greatest super hero movie of all time.", "This movie came out last year, but it hasn't really changed in any way. It's still one of the best MCU movies, especially in phase three. This movie encompasses one of the most interesting villains on-screen. Thanos decides to eliminate half the population of in the universe because he believes thinning out life will get rid of conflict for resources that would otherwise kill us. And like everyone has said by now, the CGI on Thanos is fantastic. Mix that with Josh Brolin's performance and you got an amazing character. But while Thanos is the biggest part in this movie, all the other characters get plenty of screen time. And each scene just feels organic and the pacing has a really nice flow to it. It also looks great, a lot of really good camera work, and the music is pretty good. 9.0/10 (Amazing)", "Look, whether you look at this film as a marvel fan, like me, or like a critic, like me, you can't deny that this movie subverted your expectations. This movie something very interesting which I haven't seen before; making the character who appears to be the villain be the protagonist. From the very start of this film, Thanos had been attempting (and succeeding) in obtaining all six infinity stones. This movie wasn't about the Avengers, or Tony Stark, it was about Thanos, the protagonist whom nobody wanted to see succeed. But as many movies do, the protagonist wins in the end, and we all leave the theater crying and upset about this. This isn't my favorite movie of all time (that title goes to The Dark Knight), but it most certainly is in my top 10. A must-see spectacle that will truely last throughout the ages, Avengers Infinity War will always have a place in my heart, and in other hearts too.", "When I saw the trailer for Infinity War I was like any other MCU fan boy...I squealed and screamed and I was like HFS this is going to be amazing!!!!\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Infinity War delivers on every level despite having the unenviable task of telling a HUGE story and somehow balancing this story that takes place on two planets with more super heroes then there have been in any super hero movie before or since. This is a task that would be difficult for even the most seasoned of film makers. Fortunately they brought on the writers from Captain America The First Avenger, Winter Soldier and Civil War. Of course the one thing that made this whole thing work was the Russo brothers. At the end of the day those two guys and all the talent involved pulled everything together and delivered something truly special. Infinity War finds Thanos and his Black Order: Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian searching for the Infinity Stones. Along the way, the Guardians meet up with Thor, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-man in an effort to stop the mad Titan. Coming back from his self imposed exile is the man himself, Captain America who realizes that even though the Avengers are scattered, him, Black Widow, Falcon, Bruce Banner, War Machine, Black Panther and the armies of Wakanda are the only ones who can possibly stand in the way of Thanos carrying out his plan to destroy half the life in the universe. Infinity War is a staggering sci-fi, action-packed, highly emotional piece of cinema that will bring out the tears in even the staunchest of movie critics. The finale of this movie is... something to behold. You know this movie worked when it leaves you thinking \"My God... NOW WHAT?!\". Avengers Infinity War has everything I wished the first two Avengers films could have been, and it's obviously necessary viewing for anybody who wants to see Endgame. Obviously though, a LOT of MCU movies are mandatory viewing for going into Endgame anyway. Filmmakers will be hard pressed to make something more compelling for many generations to come.", "Here comes the \"Marvel\" movie with sympathies for a supervillain, introduced first in 2012s \"Marvel's Avengers\" post-credit scene. His name is \"Thanos\", motion-capturly performed by actor Josh Brolin, known for Academy Award winning \"No Country for Old Men\" directed by the 'Coen Brothers'. The badass character is coming from outer space to enslave Earth as pathway stone and sweep the entire universe from, in his perspective scum of the galaxies. What the directors 'Russo Bros.' and producer Kevin Feige achieved here on an 300 million plus production budget comes close to perfect digital movie-making. All characters involved, interlink with there predecessor movies since 2008 \"Iron Man\", starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, who again also here leads the storyline to an inevitable thunder-slashing showdown at \"Black Panther's\" Wakanda battlefield of clashing \"Marvel\" superheroes versus \"Thanos\" supervillain army of beasts. I liked this picture very much. It reminiscences films from my youth, when political correctness were stretched to the maximum, winning 'Best Picture' Academy awards and the protagonist's nemesis won the rules of the game; as in \"French Connection\" (1971) Fernando Rey's drug-trafficking crime kingpin - \"Silence of the Lambs\" (1991) Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter - \"Scarface\" (1983) Al Pacino's 'The World is Yours' striking Tony Montana, and surprisingly cliffhanging devil pirat 'Davy Jones', performed by technically revolutionizing mo-cap acting Bill Nighy in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" of summer 2006.", "Being a huge comic book fan for over 50 years, I would have given this movie a 10 out of 10 but for only the way they treated the character of the Hulk badly .Especially in the confrontation with Thanos at the begging of the movie. In my view Hulk was not shown anywhere near his past representations of what I know of the Hulk to be. I always believed that if you start a fist fight with him you will loose. He is known for getting stronger as he gets madder. Just look at the fight with the abomination in the Hulk movie. Which is part of the MCU Universe canon, that why I was very disappointed when they diminished his worth as the character to what I always knew him to be etc..Anyway I still very much enjoyed the movie.", "The build up of this movie to get to where it is at during it's time of release is just insane. From the 1st Iron Man Movie and all the following movies after such as Captain America, Spider-man home coming, Thor, and Avengers Infinity War to name a few. It took about 22 movies (I could be wrong) to get to this final one, the end of all end, to where a new phase will begin. It's insane but how they did, the way the did it, is just superb, not perfect, but better than most. Thanks everyone behind this and please make sure Spider-man stays in the same universe! it's a must!", "Infinity War was clever. Endgame is just silly. You could write a novel about all that is wrong with it, but let's mention the most glaring examples:\n1. Time travel. Never use it as a plot device. It becomes dumb, and removes any sense of consequence. It is basically a reset button. And Endgame takes the price for amount of self contradictions when clumsily making use of it.\n2. Thanos was an interesting character in IW; here he is just a cartoon villan.\n3. Everything with Thor. Ragnarok identified him as a true god of thunder; the hammer was just to focus his powers. And now suddenly Steve Rogers can call lightning?\n4. Political correctness. Cap's main motivation for several movies has been his old pal Bucky, but now at the end it's suddenly black wing guy who gets the final moments with him and takes over the shield? I guarantee that was NOT the original plan. There's lots of PC in the movie, but this is the most glaring example. Another grating example is the whole presence of Captain Marvel; over-powerful, and yet useless.\n5. Humor. In IW it was clever. Here it is mostly reduced to fart jokes.\n6. Don't just copy yourself, Russos. The soulstone sacrifice in IW was moving. Here I could not care less.\n7. Thanos, again. In IW a handful of Avengers almost defeated him when he had the glove and most of the stones; they only failed because of the emotional stakes (again, clever). Thor bested him after he got the whole thing. And in Endgame the whole lot of them, including supergirl cannot get in a good punch when his only weapon is a big axe? There's tons more, but I'll pause at that. Final thoughts: Infinity War was clever and more importantly full of tension, from the very first scene. Endgame was boring, and more that a little annoying. I found myself distracted by my phone whilst watching it, which only happens with really bad movies. What bothers me the most is that is makes a mockery of all the ground work laid down by the best of the Marvel movies; Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, Civil war, Infinity War. It is comparable to Alien 3 after Aliens - there are good moments but you mostly want to un-see it.", "Much more engaging and far superior to its predecessor Avenger films...Infinity War is the movie we were all waiting for . 10 years build-up and it came down upon us, with sheer epic scale and gut-punching resolutions.\nIt may over-entice its somewhat bloated array of storylines with somewhat unbalanced character dynamics along the way. But this is not meant to be an ordinary film. It's a Super Smash Brothers Brawl type feature and a blockbuster like no other.\nReaching places visually and emotionally that this MCU franchise finally needed to take. Carried by a fabulous performance by Josh Brolin as Thanos, he makes this movie his own, as the Avengers are just there to do their best. But is their best enough. Such an epic experience. It's an event more than a film, and be sure to ready your expectations. Because the Russo's send us off with pure cinematic, shakespearean-esk illuminations. Setting up for maybe an even better Avengers sequel. But let's just hope they don't get too predictable on us.\nOne for a generation. What an experience.", "Here's my review of AVENGERS INFINITY WAR. That's right I had to type that title in caps cause that's how big this movie is. It's a Visual 'Marvel'. Get it ? Visual \"Marvel\". That's a bad attempt at humor.sorry. Moving on , iw is directed by the Russo brothers and stars almost everyone ?!. Now the story has a lot of arcs to it but is centralized to one Thanos. I loved how they set up character introductions along the way and made sure there was no phasing issues which is really important in a movie close to 3 hours. This movie is a really dark one but the one liners and humour are spot on and are never forced anywhere unlike justice league *cough* *cough*. I also loved how they took time to explore other worlds in the movie while there was so much going on , there is a lot going on in this movie , like a lot ! . But just like any other movie on the hype train it does have it's flaws. Remember how I said there were many arcs , sometimes the switch from one arc to another takes a really long time . Other than that , ok what else ? . The CGI in this movie is amazing but personally I thought they could've done better with iron man's armor. And even the little details on Josh brolins face were really good. And when you finally feel like these arcs are gonna combine and all for something bigger , then BOOM ! A cliffhanger right there.And it's an ending I'm still trying to figure out. In the end , avengers infinity war is something which travels beyond expectation , with great characters , a gripping story , great visuals and a cliffhanger ending for the avengers to actually \"assemble\" in the next movie (hopefully) .", "Avengers: Infinty War is a great set up to the big finale for this saga. The characters meet each other and team up without it being forced, and the tone perfectly is set from the very beginning that s**t it hitting the fan. Thanos is not just evil, he genuinely believes hes making the world a better place. He needed to be the best villian of the series and he easily is. The things he does in this movie. Sheesh. This is his movie. These characters have come such a long way, and we got to be there for it all. Which makes it so hard to watch as they all fail, and inevitably fall. Theres tons going on but it's so well balanced. I love this chapter. The only thing I could say is some heros dont seem that strong or important but other than that...amazing. 90%", "It shoudn't end this way (starts crying). However, it was great. Marvel really knows how to entertain.", "But couldn't get it to it like I did the other movies.", "Infinity War is Thanos' movie, and it works. It's told from the perspective of the Avengers, but the whole film is to build up the character of Thanos, and he will be remembered as a pop culture icon for years to come, much like Darth Vader for Star Wars. When we remember the big villains of the MCU, Thanos will come to mind, and Thanos makes this movie great. It's special effects are also probably some of the best in movie history, as to be expected from the budget, but even some movies with similar budget can't pull off special effects this good *cough* justice league *cough* This is the ultimate gift to a marvel fan, this and Endgame, and I would say this would be amazing to watch back to back with Endgame as a two-part epic.", "Thank god for marvel, for this beautiful heroes, I love you.", "It sucks... I don't understand the hype.\nYou could foresee half the things that happened in the movie.\nSure the special effects were cool, but that's about it.\nI guess you have to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy it and they must be the only ones seeing and rating this movie since it got so high rate. Save your time and watch something else!", "This movie is absolutely Incredible. Perfect balance between the actors, great prelude to the storm ahead in Endgame.", "I had almost no expectations for Infinity War when I entered the theater chamber to see it last year. It was several weeks after the movie's initial release so the theater itself was fairly light on visitors for Infinity War in particular. I was pretty much alone through my experience of the movie. For context, I have only a surface level knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have seen quite a bit of the older movies but only know most of the more recent characters through friends and online reviewers and the like. So, as a normie without any great attachment to most of the prior films, you can imagine my surprise when this movie becomes one of my favorite superhero movies ever made. Much like the finale to the X-Men Cinematic Universe from a year before, Logan, Infinity War blows all expectations out of the water and provides an experience that stands above all of the prior films in its respective universe. But whereas Logan does this by providing a small-scale character study, Infinity War outdoes its predecessors by going bigger than ever before. A bigger cast, bigger fight scenes, and a wayyyyy bigger budget. Understand me when I say that I am not a big fan of superhero movies, not even most of the Marvel ones aside from Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor: Ragnarok, and maybe the original Iron Man. But the culmination of all these stories really is greater than the sum of its parts. I believe a big part of this is because the directors and writers took several loathed superhero tropes (giant CG fight scenes, scary alien villain, the MacGuffin) and did them well. This movie, to me, is a shining example that the only thing keeping a trope from being good is how much effort you're willing to put in. As this movie and Avengers: Endgame are the ultimate finale to the \"Infinity Saga\" of the MCU, almost all major characters introduced in the past movies are featured here. You have the original five Avengers (excluding Hawkeye), Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, etc. All in all, the movie has around 20 major protagonists to juggle. This sounds like it would be an absolute trainwreck if it weren't for the fact that the film dodges two of the biggest problems that Marvel movies tend to suffer from: bland scripts and meandering pace. The dialogue is solid, the story itself is interesting with plenty of unexpected turns, and every scene of the film pushes the story forward. If you want to see a great example of how to fail at these, I'd recommend the Antman movies. All of this, however, would only amount to an alright movie if it weren't for the main antagonist, Thanos. In a cinematic universe filled with simplistic, uninteresting villains (with exceptions like Loki and the Winter Soldier), Thanos breaks the mold by being an intriguing, quotable, and identifiable villain. Despite being a warmongering space tyrant, Thanos has one of the most altruistic motivations for his evil doings; Thanos wants to destroy half of life in the universe to keep them from depleting the universe's finite resources and plunging into squalor. At first, he attempts this by manually traveling through space and slaughtering half of every intelligent species he finds. At some point, he realizes that his initial will never work and decides to track down the Infinity Stones, five gems that can manipulate the universe to the user's whim. With those stones, Thanos could peacefully and instantly erase half of all life in the universe with the snap of his fingers. Much of the fun of this movie is watching Thanos and his minions hop from place to place, interacting with the many different heroes and collecting the stones. The interactions with Ebony Maw are some of my favorites. Another plus for the story is how it breaks from the formula and features the MCU cast losing to Thanos and many of them dying in the resulting universal mass killing. It adds much needed emotional weight to the movie since you don't know who could be next. It also helps that most characters dying or reacting to the deaths are effective in conveying genuine emotion. As memey as it is, the final scenes where characters just fade into leaves gives me chills. Shoutout to Drax, Bucky, Scarlet Witch, and Spider-Man for making me really uncomfortable. All of these positives are held up even further with excellent production value. Visually, almost all of the settings are incredible. I have to give a special shoutout to the scenes in space as they are particularly beautiful. Most of the settings on Earth are nice, too, excluding Wakanda which looks so washed out compared to the rest of the movie. Wakanda is also the location of the weakest fight scene in the movie. In a movie filled with great fight scenes, it's not that bad, but it's the only one that features two giant armies of nameless characters clashing with one another. I prefer the fight scenes featuring prominent and important characters because that leaves more room for fun interaction with dialogue and choreography. Despite my complaints, I still overall enjoyed Wakanda in general and these quibbles should only show how much I love the rest of the movie. The fight scenes have a nice ramp-up, starting small and crescendoing to interplanetary mayhem; most of the humor works other than a few weird outliers like the Starbucks joke from one of the Wakanda scenes; the music is surprisingly nice here, with the orchestral pieces feeling more prominent and characterized than the more generic scores from past Marvel films. Before I leave, I can't help but shout out the CGI team on their work here. This move has some of the best CGI in a live action movie I have ever seen. I don't just mean to say that looks advanced and expensive (even though it does), but rather that the models are well-integrated into scenes and they're stylized to age much better than contemporary renders. It honestly boggles my mind that the company that funded this is also funding the movie where Will Smith genie looks like an Adobe After Effects edit. The character design and animation of Thanos, along with the great performance by Josh Brolin, carries the character (and by extension, the movie) and saves him from being a laughing stock like most other CG superhero villains *cough Steppenwolf cough*. To put it simply, there isn't a single thing that Infinity War does wrong. Pacing, action scenes, CGI, dialogue, art direction, comedy, drama ... While it isn't high art and won't satisfy someone with a palette that goes against Marvel movies even when they're good, I'd say that almost anyone other than those that are expressly against superhero movies will find something to remember and appreciate this movie for. For me, it's just about everything the movie does and the occasional slip-up every few scenes is nowhere near enough to put me off of rewatching it.", "Yes, this is a superb movie. So many characters\\heroes and still managable. Thanos as villain perfect. He has reason, not just a dumb evlil nobody. Good job. I wish Endgame was that cool as this movie.", "I think this is the best marvel movie ever, better than endgame. thanos is an amazing villain and the action and scenes in this film are breathtaking, the battle in wakanda is great plus thor appearing with storm breaker during the battle was sensational", "Marvel supervillains have been laughing stock . Be it Loki or Ultron, they have looked easily defeatable. Thanos looks invincible and deadly. Great movie", "With every Marvel Cinematic Universe film, the stories get better and they each get deeper. They also are getting longer, this film runs for 2 and 1/2 hours. Well worth the runtime, and you'll get a glimpse of nearly every MCU character to date, which is cool. Is the end of the MCU coming? Maybe in a few years from now (2019), it'll be epic!! The Disney studio has done a tremendous job with bringing the films from script to screen. I may be a tad biased, but the MCU is much better and higher quality than the DC universe. In twenty years, the MCU films will be remembered much better. Infinity War is a great comic book film! Watch the entire MCU to understand the story though, or you'll be lost. Happy watching.", "Reviewing this after end game. This movie is hard to beat. They did an excellent job with this MCU film. Thanos was excellently presented.", "Watched a bunch of times can't understand how people don't get it", "The film goes straight to the point, already begins with Thanos putting his plan into practice to get all the jewels of the infinite and thus complete his plan. The film is totally focused on Thanos, the film is his, to introduce the character to the public and, consequently, to understand the idea of him and, because he wants to kill half of the universe. The end of the movie, by the way, was unexpected, I did not expect the heroes to lose and half the universe to die. But it is not because the heroes have lost that it is a bad movie, for min is even better, a different movie, worth watching.", "Arguably, the best MCU movie ever made, and yes, I watched Endgame. Many people say Infinity War is the action and Endgame is the brain and I agree totally with that, but in Endgame there are many things that can be questioned, the decisions, things that did not make sense, things that can't be explained, some rushed choices and many more. But Infinity War is perfect, it is balanced, it is well written, it is action-packed and the most important thing, it never gets boring, not for a single second. There is always something happening, something big and exciting, heart pounding and stressful. There is happiness and there is grief, there is team work and there is power. Incredible re-introduction of all the characters that we've seen throughout the MCU journey with some of the most amazing visuals and CGI effects ever seen in the movie theaters.", "Too dumb for words. I don't buy Andy Dwyer as anything close to a badass.\nAnd a tween Spiderman?\nExplains a lot about the people who rate this high.", "Much better than endgame Till now since last year i watched this movie 6 times and\nI can watch it again and again and again Storyline with character development was amazing", "I have watched it and feels like something more to have. I watched 2 time to understand the plot. So what is happening to it. Hopefully it will Releasing soon..", "I remember when the first Avengers movie came out all people lost their minds from the biggest crossover of superheroes in history; six years later the snowball has gotten bigger and now the boulder of awesomeness is rolling to crash us. The trait of Marvel that has always attracted me is that every film is a part of an enormous puzzle that leads to the picture that stands out from everything that we have ever seen. A continuous story leaves no choice but to take a hold of the feelings from the last chapter and ride that wave again with all the worries and excitement. The scale of the performance is gigantic - it's not a brawl on the streets, not a journey between two cities, the action is literally everywhere. All the characters that throughout the history of the universe caught our eye are there in one way of another, not every one of them knows each other but in the face of the grave danger they will have the acquaintance of their lives. A rather fast change of sets does not let you rest and prepares all the ingredients for the main dish that will be served afterwards. Overall the motivation of the characters is straight and understandable, however, some decisions don't show lazy writing but are there to screw with the future of the universe and could have been avoided with a snap of fingers. I totally agree that Thanos is one of the greatest villains of all time: ready to do whatever it takes to reach the goal and the sweetest part is that he is unpredictable as hell and considering that he increases his power with every step the fate of our heroes is in constant and imminent threat. The hallmark of Marvel is a solid plot with ultra-quality effects and this case is not an exception. Multiple incredible eye-pleasing moments leave you with an open mouth and keep making you wonder if ever the imagination well of screenwriters will dry out. Recovering from one of the best cliffhangers of the recent years I will say that 'Infinity war' is so far one of the best movies of the MCU - nearly perfect roller-coaster of emotions accompanied by superb score. Let's hope that from this beautiful egg will hatch an outstanding creature that will live in our memory forever.", "The 10 year build up of Marvel movies was definitely worth it, and certainly worth the hype. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" (2018), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Josh Brolin, and many more! All I can say is, just like \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" (2014), this movie was mind-blowing. Mentally, I was not prepared for this masterpiece of a movie. I went in there with high hopes, and those hopes were exceeded. Everything ranging from the acting, the special effects, the story, etc. It was all first-rate (AND THEN SOME!) Now, one thing that can ruin a movie is annoying one-liners, or jokes. Marvel movies are full of them! However, this film keeps them to a minimum, which was very refreshing. They're finally realizing how unnecessary most one-liners are in their movies. What jokes they do have in \"Avengers: Infinity War\", are funny, and they are few and far between. It is a very well-balanced film from action, to comedy, and to drama. It was one of those rare experiences where a movie was so good, that the theater was silent during the whole movie. When that happens, you know you did a good job with your movie. I do have to confess something. A lot of you know that I didn't like the \"Black Panther\" (2018) movie, I also really hate the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies, \"Ant-Man\" (2015), and the \"Doctor Strange\" (2016) movie. I was worried that those characters might ruin the movie, or be distracting. But, they were not bad at all. Like I said, Black Panther works better as a team player, and so does Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy. In solo movies, those characters are dull, boring, cringeworthy and sometimes obnoxious! However, when they're part of a team, or playing side characters, they're not obnoxious at all. Also, since Ant-Man isn't in this movie, he's not a factor! Is this the best superhero movie? It's phenomenal, but there are some that I still personally like better. Is it the new best Marvel movie? Well, it's certainly in my top 5 on my Marvel Cinematic Universe ranking list! Overall, the cast is insane, but Josh Brolin as Thanos really steals the show. I will not spoil anything about this movie for you. You'll have to go see the movie to find out for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job! I look forward to the sequel, and other future movies with your involvement. It's worth the money to buy on DVD, or to find some other method of watching it. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen \"Avengers: Infinity War\" yet, what are you waiting for? You must check it out!", "Infinity war is not one single thing. It is not all great, but at it's best it is easily worth an 8. Some of the action scenes are mind blowing. Unfortunately it is unable to keep the greatness through the entire film. Maybe, when I have seen Endgame I would want to change the score.", "Yes, it is one of the best superheroe movies till this day. Yes, it is one of the most spectacular ones. But I think there are still some flaws like the \"mini boses\" which have a minimal screen time.", "The film develops so well its plot that at any moment of it feels some moment of filling, has good moments of action, suspense and comedy, even for some people the film is cut short although it lasts about 2 hours and 30 minutes.", "It's been 10 years since this cinematic universe kicked for with 2008s Iron man. And oh boy does this film deliver on everything. It's action-packed, hearbreaking, thrilling and everything it should've been! This film was well worth the 10 build up and now it's just 1 year for the next one to see how this story unfolds.", "This movie was amazing. The plot and synopsis is extremely well written, and the visuals are stunning. My favorite part was Thanos' character development. When he threw Gamora off to obtain one of the infinity stones, the movie portrayed him as a villain with real emotion, not like a general villain that does bad things without remorse. I was extremely impressed with this movie. Probably my favourite movie of 2018.", "If you are a Marvel fan then you've probably already watched this movie and really enjoyed it. I thought that there was more of a story than a lot of the other Marvel movies and the special effects were very well done. But... I am not really into the whole lore of the Marvel universe and for me it was a bit of a so-so movie. Eye candy and fight scenes really only hold me for so long when watching a movie.", "This is the best yet and it most definitely made history", "I always have difficulty reviewing Marvel movies become I'm a huge fanboy and I have to remind myself that I must be objectively honest. So, to be honest, I went in with very high expectations for this movie because the Russo Brothers have shown time and time again that they are story-first action-second Director's, nothing like your Michael Bay's. Additionally, this is one of my favorite comics from when I was a kid and I was thrilled to see all my heroes come together on the big screen. Even then, this film still exceeded every expectation that I had. I was shocked, confused, excited, happy, sad, distraught, invested, heartbroken, and hopeful. So many emotions. This film stands on the shoulders of the 18 films before it, sure, but I can't find it in my soul to say that it's anything less than a spectacular story. Anyone that hates on this film went into the theater determined to be disappointed. It's so easy to enjoy this film that if you don't, it's because you didn't want to. I've seen a lot of people complain about some of the Vfx, so I'll address that. Yes, some of it is bad. I can think of a couple times myself where I felt like I was taken out of the movie by the bad cgi. However, this is a $500 million movie with 50+ heroes and villains, over 1,200 vfx shots, and a nearly 3 hour run time. What do you expect? Come on. None of the bad cg ruined anything for me. Thanos looked amazing throughout the entire film. A 9 foot tall pink alien with full body scars that has more screen time than anyone else in the movie looked INCREDIBLE. That alone is miracle and a technological milestone. Remember where vfx was like 15 years ago? Honestly, it's incredible. Technology has advanced RAPIDLY to catch up with the demand for cinematic blockbusters like Infinity War and they did it right with this one. I look forward to Avengers: Endgame and I can't wait to see what the Russo's have in store for us. They captivated the world with Infinity War, Endgame will captivate the universe.", "All I can say is wow, been a marvel fan since the 80s and this just blows any other superhero movie away love love love", "I was very pleased with this movie. It seemed to be a none stop thrill ride and leaves me wondering what is going to happen after watching the showings following the credits.", "In my opinion, this is one of the best movies I have ever watched. I waited a long time to see this movie and I wasnt disappointed. The special effects were fabulous and the story line was amazing. The actores were great and grey did an outstanding job in portraying this characters. I recomend you this movie, specially if you love science-fiction movies.", "Way too much i.e. endless fighting, CGI expressions take far longer to develop than human, barely any semblance of a plot, whether Save the Cat! or Hero's Journey it's weak and disorganized. And despite another reviewer claiming I'm \"not worth listening to,\" I have seen all other Marvel movies, many of them multiple times, and this one twice. The first and third Iron Man movies were far more enjoyable. If they'd left another hour's worth on the cutting room floor, this could have been a significantly better movie.", "I thougt super heros were undefeatable. Not in this action packed CGI laden film that gathers all the Marvel Comic characters for a battle to save the universe. Yet the plot seems to be all over the universe with the Avengers having a tough time in the war. The downer comes with an unfinal ending geared so you will fork out cash to see the next installment. I won't be wasting any more money on this BS.", "The CGI is great, the acting is good, the action is wonderful, Thanos is really scary, every hero (almost) is here. And yet things make little sense. There are again confusion between forces that have many orders of magnitude between them, there is little strategic or, indeed, tactical logic in this \"war\". I enjoyed the film and I am sure it's going to blow so many people away, but it was so damn pointless.  Anyway, the idea is that the movie is just the first of a two parter so my recommendation is to wait until both movies have been released and watch them back to back. I know it's hard, with all the references flying around you and friends wanting to discuss how Star Lord destroyed the universe (oops!), but I think you will enjoy the ending a lot more knowing you will be watching the rest in a few minutes and not next year.", "Such an action packed movie. A lot of sadness action and comedy. Greatness.", "This movie is probaly the best movie i ever saw warning HUGE SPOILERS so as i was saying this movie had everything you want from a movie action comedy suspense just to name a few this is a movie for everyone but some people will be upset because of thanos's snap i was espesaily spiderman, black panther, gamora ( not because of the snap) overall go see it!", "Great movie!!!!!! Love how they brought everyone from the MCU together for this. Looking forward to Avengers 4!!!!!", "Infinity War was incredible. It provides a perfect balance between both heartbreak and laughter. Wow.", "Not a major fan of Avengers, but this is the best of the lot but there are many flaws with Infinity War, one of them is the Thanos powers are not clearly consistant. The battles happen in a here there and everywhere fashion. It sometimes feel like different movies all put together and sometimes hard to follow whos doing what and for what purpose. The battles scenes are great with exceptionally visuals and cgi but the purpose to defeat one undefeated villian is jumbled up. Infinity Wars is clearly an overated movie but deserves credit especially in the visuals and a simple plot which the movie intends to make it complex. I didnt feel the superheroes powers like we did in their stand alone movies, its like a buffet. The worst performance was The Hulk, he had absolutely no business in being there if he was not willing each time to show his powers.  I expected more from Infinity Wars since the big hype and thought they could have done more fighting as united Avengers to defeat one main villain. I know this might be done deliberately so that we can spend another 2,5 hours again for the next installment. Nevertheless its still an entertaining movie that I liked but not love or drool over it like some fans, has its ups and down with top of the range visual effects.  Some say that it is so sad in the end, honestly I did not feel anything for them at the end, the ending is just bad, and it might turn out diffently in the next installment. Between Black Panther and Infinity War, I would prefer Black Panther as it was more focused on the characters and story which is a better made film overall. To have a rating of 8.6 on imdb is undeserving as these are mostly fanboys superior ratings.  To give where credit is due is only in the visuals and cgi and maybe in the difficulty in making such a huge movie with a huge cast that is why I give a 7 out of 10 M", "As i know The Russo brothers they would do anything for a good content and as you see in the movie they even did they killed the half of the cast from the movie now i dont know what they are preparing for part 2,but whatever it is should be good.If it isnt than MCU would suck like justice league=DC.Me personally i liked the part when the fight begin.Hey,8.6/10 it is just better with 8/10 thats it no more or less", "Great movie. Great movie. Great movie. Great movie.", "Before watching Infinity War, I was really tired of the MCU.\nBesides Homecoming and GOTG, I felt like all the movies were cookie cutter garbage, including the \"classics\". \nHowever, IW made me feel excited for a franchise that was pretty much dead to me.\nIt took risks, which was what Marvel needed for a while.\nI'm glad they decided to end the movie killing off the money makers of the franchise.\nThis may sound rough, but I hope most of the characters remain dead. \nLet's just hope Marvel actually learns from this movie and stop playing it safe.", "The Big Bang created six stones that each govern aspects of the universe. Somebody wanna 'splain me why they aren't scattered in galaxies billions of light years apart, maybe in the cores of planets, instead of being in one small region of space where they can all be collected? So Thanos, mastermind of the previous attack on New York, has a theory that saving the universe means bringing it back within its carrying capacity by killing half the sentient life forms on every world. So he sends his minions to earth to collect the stones he's still missing. To combat them, all the various Marvel characters come together, and it is indeed great fun to see them. There's a climactic battle in Wakanda, where Thanos completes his quest and people, including some Marvel folk, begin disintegrating, presumably because Thanos can now will their disappearance. We see Thanos sitting under an alien moon, and given the reassurance that he will return.  Okay, where do they go from here? Just imagine the chaos if half the human race vanishes. It'll make the \"Left Behind\" scenario look mild in comparison. What will Thanos do for an encore? He already has the Infinity Gauntlet. And do they fight Thanos with magic and psychic powers? No, plain old \"Biff\" \"Pow\" mechanical force. Stuff that the military does quite capably. So wouldn't a few F-35's help a little bit? Wouldn't a few gunships help with that attacking horde at Wakanda?  So a lot of very fun stuff that fizzles out into yet another chaotic mass melee and a profoundly disappointing ending.", "This movie is actually better than I expected but not in the top 100 movies of all time nor in the top 10 of this year.\nDon't expect much or any character development in this movie. \n95% of all the characters were already introduced in previous Marvel movies.\nYou would have had to have seen at least ten others marvel movies to get any joy out of this movie .  So this one goes straight to the action .The super heroes are in groups and they fight separate fights and the movie seems scattered . The obvious plot does not make up for it, the characters do not develop further , it often feels more like a good computer game then a movie. \nSo cannot give it more than a 7 * .  It is not as bad as you might expect from such a movie and the plot does get a bit more interesting, however simplistic it is... \nSuper heros are no longer invincible , unfortunately many of them are still far from human . We cannot really identify with them or estimate if any of their actions actually make any sense - we are a spectators, like spectators of a video game we have never seen before..\n For example how much punishment can a super hero or super villain take before he dies, we have no idea and there is no gauge. Sometimes they just get up again other times not..  The movie does have some interesting sub plots and parts to it , yes even the villains have a human side. Nevertheless the main villains motive for wanting to destroy half the universe is unsatisfactory, at best .  The good part is that it is not too predictable, the movie has good CGI and well actually good actors in most of the roles.", "Maybe my review is really different from another perception. I always watch that Marvel movies (under Walt Disney Company) is similar with DC Movies.. like Avenger Civil War is similar with Batman VS Superman, and now Infinity War, that Thanos search power stone is similar like Steppenwolf search Mother's Box to accumulate his power to become unlimited.. but we should admitted that Marvel is more attractive than DC", "Infinity War was hyped up to be an incredible spectacle, but although there were some incredible moments, especially with most one-liners being absolutely on point, some parts feel unnecessary; some drag on somewhat (Vision is a boring chap); and the whole film, especially the start, feels overtly Star Wars-y, which really confuses the viewing experience of a Marvel film, and leaves it overall as acceptably good, but not great.", "There are a lot of movies that are rated worse than this one that are clearly better: inception, lord of the rings, matrix, usual suspects, and the list could go on. I know I'm not the first to say this as many people have stated this in reviews before. Although, I really liked this movie and thought this movie was an 8, the ratings need go down.", "Good action, good special effects, and a terrible stupid and predictable plot. You know a movie is not good storywise when you keep looking at your watch to know how much time is left before it ends. And that's what I did when watching Infinity War, because the movie was so absolutely predictable that it got tedious. Also, it had not one, but TWO instances of one of the cliches I hate the most, the \"save a loved one, let the world die\" cliche. And both are announced from miles away. When Vision makes the correct decision of committing suicide by having the mind stone destroyed and everyone is stupidly against it and when Dr. Strange says he will let Tony or Peter die rather than surrender the time stone. Sure, let half the universe die (including many of your loved ones) so you don't have to see THIS ONE PERSON die or kill them. And no, there's no circumstance when this will ever be right. In the case of Dr. Strange, just to make the NEXT movie even more predictable, it's clear that giving up his stone was part of a plan to make the one future where Thanos is defeated come true. That means I already know in broad terms what's going to happen in the next movie, especially with Fury calling in Captain Marvell in the post-credit scene.\nAdded to that is how terrible the fight scenes were. Not in that they were badly choreographed or executed, but in how stupid they were. I'll just mention two instances, so keep from being repetitive.\n1. Dr. Strange or Wong could have beaten Thanos and his minions instantly. Just materialize a teleport opening around their necks and close it. Problem solved. This is as stupid as not using the luck potion or the time-travel amulet in Harry Potter to defeat Voldemort.\n2. Why the hell is Thanos wasting time punching people after he got the reality stone? Just do what he did to Drax and Mantis to everyone. Turn all of them at once to confetti or cotton candy. Wish the mind stones off Vision's head and into his hand. And so on and so forth. This, in its turn, is as stupid as Green Lanterns making those constructs of theirs because writers think they look cool, when they should just disintegrate their enemies using their allegedly omnipotent rings of power. Only limited to your willpower and imagination still gives you a lot of leeway to use the best possible option: death rays.\nIn short, as I expected, Marvel people have ran out of ideas. Now I see clearly why Thor: Ragnarok was a comedy. If they had tried to make a serious dramatic movie, it would ended up being as boring as Infinity War.", "Everything about the movie was just meh. They know if they put everybody's favorite characters into one movie people will go see it. The problem is that there's no time to focus on any one. Theres no character development. With just a simple story keeping the characters going. and then just non stop fast paced action. for 3 hours straight. and then little funny one liners from characters in between action. These cross over movies are only made to sell out in box office. They do this by looking at statistics. It seems that's the only thing they consider when making these movies.  There were stupid character decisions and plot holes. I get that Thanos has his inifinty stones and he's very powerful. but how come all our heroes are completely useless with their stones? Dr. Strange can go in the future, see scenarios play out and rewind time. This is by far the most useful stone and for some reason he doesn't do anything. At one point they are pulling off Thanos's glove which will pretty much save everyone, and then it gets ruined because starlord hits him and wakes him up. Ok so hes stupid. he hit him. why couldnt dr strange just rewind that part and do it again. Then you have the mind stone and the character vision. Apparently it lets you control peoples minds. Should be able to work on thanos and change his mind to not want to destroy half of all life. Heres a better idea. lets stab vision repeatedly throughout the movie and then give the stone to thanos.  At the end of the movie I didn't even know how to feel. Everybody in the theater was amazed by the ending. Omg the good guys were supposed to win. but they didn't for once. What a masterpiece. like what? Since when does a simple plot twist excuse a bad movie. I know I can't be the only one who feels this way. So anyways we know there will be a sequel. And of course marvel isn't going to kill off half their characters. That would be a lot of lost money. The soul stone can apparently trap peoples souls in another world. My bet would be that Thanos didn't actually kill everybody but rather just used the stone to transport them somewhere else. Looks like we have to wait another year to learn what we already know. The good guys will win! I am not disappointed about this movie. Everything was kind of expected. What I am dissapointed about is how this is being rated at 9/10. This movie does not even come close. A fair imdb rating would be 6/10. sparkly vfx do not count for +3.", "As always I went into this film believing it was going to be one of the best Marvel movies of all time but once again I am disappointed with the outcome. Don't get me wrong as far as what the fans want to see such as good CGI, their favorite heroes all together, descent action sequences, and random comedy; this film is not bad at all, but I was hoping for the MCU's tenth film to be their very best. two hours and thirty minutes is more than enough time to give each hero the spotlight and display their abilities or heroism but it seemed as if Thor and Doctor Strange were the only two with that wow moment I was hoping to see with almost everyone. RDJ has mastered the art of timing when it comes to comedy and jokes and I loved seeing the bond between him and Tom, but aside that this film was just so ehhh. Banner was Hulk literally for three minutes then for the remainder of the film is bruce which is the exact opposite of what the fans were hoping for. Towards the end of the movie during the climax I was expecting some of the best action sequences Ive seen in years and they were so mediocre. I feel like it was such a waste of talent from the actors themselves and for the heroes. Overall the film is a great blockbuster to take the family to for a good time, but I would not see it twice.", "Prepared for 10 years, infinity war was definitely the best movie of Marvel series ever. \nFirst of all, let's talk about the characters. Iron man, Tony showed his responsibility to save the world, after the civil war. That meant he didn't stick to the rules but followed his will to save lives. Captain American still fought for his justice, so do other heroes, such as black widow, black panther, and scarlet witch. Thor felt sad, angry, and helpless, but he still stood out and fight for the people. In addition, even though Star lord looked easy about the destruction, he knew that he had nothing to lose; that's why he was angry about Thanos when he heard about Gamora's death. Most important of all, the villian, Thanos, also had lots of stories. We knew that he had a dream, that the balance of the universe could persist. Consequently, he searched infinity gems with all his heart. There were so many other characters that could not be analyzed thoroughly in my review. However, that meant the movie was successful about building characters. \nSecond, this movie gave us a strong emotion, despair. At the begin of this movie, it showed us how much powerful Thanos was. Until the end fo the movie, we still couldn't figure out any solution to defeat him. That stressful plot made audience to gave more concentration. Additionally, some funny parts really spiced up this movie and made this movie not so sad. \nThird, the action scenes were designed so great that I couldn't take my eyes off the movie. Take some examples, such as Dr. Stranger's fight, the invasion of Thanos's army, and the fight against Thanos. \nThere were a lot advantages that I couldn't mention in this review. However, there were still some defects of this movie. Take an example. Thanos's love to Gamora was not so obvious, that I couldn't feel sad for Thanos.\nOverall, this was the best Marvel movie ever.", "Yes this is a POPCORN EPIC ACTION COMIC FLICK! But the Stakes are Real, We can feel the Pain of Loss and Wow!!! The Villian is Far more Complex than Anything I had Expected! This is a Must Watch for Marvel MCU Fans! Loads of Winks, Nods, Payoffs, Laughs, and WTFS!!!", "I was not disappointed!! This movie was a roller coaster of emotions but I loved every single scene. This is a must watch!!!!", "Avengers Infinity War is a good movie that continues to make the same plot mistakes and the same abuse of comedy. For a story arc as important as Thanos's, this joke takes away seriousness and in no time you connect with that threat. The action scenes are very good and the CGI excellent although it also has moments in which it is very bad ... if you do not see Bruce Banner inside the Hulk Buster so that they realize. An entertaining movie but full of empty plot and I'm telling you that NO, it's not the best superhero movie in history as they do not try to sell it, it's not even the best Marvel movie to date, that's what Iron Man is for 1, Captain America Winter Soldier and the first of Avengers that are still better, much less is on par with the great movie of Nolan The Dark Knight as they try to make us believe too, that is still the best superhero movie ever created. My rating is a 6.5 out of 10.", "I liked the movie, but I have some problems with it. -There were too many jokes. That doesn't mean I didn't like them, or that they ruined the mood, but half of them were unnecessary...they could easily use that time for story and characters. -Too many characters. The problem isn't exactly what I said, but mostly \"the focus\" of the characters, some characters were there just to be there...they were ok (not bad), but I would rather see more important characters. In my opinion the best characters in the movie were Thanos, his servents, Iron man, Doctor Strange. A little bit less, but also Thor, Star Lord and Gamora. But for all of them I wish they had more screen time, to be even better. Wanda and Vision were also pretty important, but personally I didn't really like them that much, I mean they were ok. Vision was also kinda disappointing in terms of power (remember, he was very important and powerful in Age of Ultron). I also wish that they would spend more time on the stones, their story, powers and things like that. There are also some other things I want to say (positive, or some nitpicks), but it's really not that important and I don't want to go too much into details. Oh, effects were very good, better than in movies before, so that's why I mentioned it.", "Infinity War is by far, one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. The movie also not only lives up to the hype, but exceeds it. The acting, cinematography, and story were phenomenal, and I was engaged throughout the entire movie. Also, this is not your average Marvel movie. The deaths of Peter, Bucky, Dr. Strange, T'Challa, Falcon, etc. felt real. It actors made the audience feel as if they were watching real people with human emotions die, something not often seen in a superhero film. In conclusion, I strongly recommend going to see this movie.", "So on thursday i went into this movie an i had REALLY high expectations !  But sadly for me it was way too much of \"coolness\" or \"fun\" and way too less story and character interaction. All those superheroes you like and those you don\u00b4t are thrown into one movie and then it becomes a movie with so many different locations and storylines that its just to much to be good or suspens. A lot of those storylines are irrelevant and don\u00b4t matter for the \"big story\" at all. The important stroylines on the other hand get way too less time and are often rushed because the movie \"needs\" time for more.... I hoped that the story would have some exiting parts or some secrets that get revealed but it seems all so meaningless cause you know they are going to make more movies with some of those characters. Its all just a big and expensive commercial for part 2 and you could just see a short cut of this and then go into part 2, without even loosing a single bit of story. For some specific scenes i like or didn\u00b4t see down below. \nOh and sorry for the intermediate english.  SPOILER:  Some scenes really pissed me of !!! For once, why ruin the great scene between Starlord and Gamora with this StUPID joke? It wasen\u00b4t even a good one, just the typical marvel humor that is easily made by building a serious situation between characters and then breaking the tone with something so stupid that you have to laugh (which i did) but after that you realize that it destroyed the whole scene and you cant take as emotionale as it should be. Or the fact that all those fights seemed so without impact to me. I mean Thanos throws a fucking METHOR at Iron-Man and he just shrugs it of?! And then he gets seriously hurt by some piece of his armor and you think this could actually get interesting but seconds later he just heals himselfe and all is fine... \nBut the scene that pissed me of the most was when Starlord ruins it all by stupidly going nuts on Thanos AFTER he already was ok with killing Gamora for the greater good. This made one of my favorite characters just stupid and i hated it cause they build up so much tension and then blow it of just like that... \nI think i will watch the last Avengers in the cinema just to know how they end it, but i am really bored and disappointed in this one (and in a lot of marvel movies before this one) and i hope they ether start it from a new perspective or they just let it end.", "If you thought the Russo movies was making a serious movie after they made Winter Soldier and Civil War, think again. This is just another Joss Whedon movie with crappy jokes and one liners throughout the entire movie. Also some of the characters I liked the most were underutilized in the movie like Captain America and Black Panther. Instead they focused on the Guardians, Thor, Iron Man, Spider Man, Doctor Strange, and Hulk. All these characters were full of crappy jokes and one liners in a movie that's about a mad titan trying to destroy half of the universe Also, the actions scenes were disappointing. There were some pretty impressive action scenes like Hulk vs Thanos and Iron Man/Spider Man/Doctor vs Thanos in the end. But there's really not a single action scene that is as memorable as the highway fight scene in Winter Soldier or the airport fight scene in Civil War. Most of the action scenes were people just flying back and explosions and it almost felt like a Transformers movie sometimes. Another strange thing about the action scenes is that when it would get really good it would cut into another scene somewhere else. Thanos by far is easily the best thing in the movie. He actually has depth to him and his scenes with Gamora were some of the strongest scenes in the movie. He also didn't say stupid jokes like Ultron did and was mostly serious for the whole movie which is a huge plus. I did laugh in the end though when he snapped his fingers and people were turning to ash, it was so overly dramatic that I chuckled when some of the characters disappeared. The other villains which I believed are the Black Order all looked like villains from a Warcraft game, all cgi and they looked stupid except for Ebony Maw who died too quickly.  All in all, this should have a been a much more serious movie along like the lines of Winter Soldier and Civil War and most of the actions scenes had too much going on with stupid jokes that undermined the tension of it. The story also wasn't really that good except for Thanos's character who was so good that I was rooting for him instead of the stupid sitcom characters known as the Avengers.Very disappointing movie.", "This review contains minor spoilers. There are few things you will be doing right after you finish watching this movie.\n1- You will most likely be completely silence or speechless.\n2- You will want to watch the 2nd part ASAP!\n3- You will search the Internet for \"What powers does Cap. Marvel has?\" or read her bio on wiki sites.\n4- You will be wondering WHY did Dr. Strange not ONCE used his time reverse trick on Thanos? Now to the quick review. The movie is GREAT spectacular fun with best CGI created sets and scenes out there. Typical Marvel trademarked one liner jokes are just there for laughs and they an ok job to make you either giggle or laugh out loud. Since it is the first part, you will feel like you were robbed off the full story but don't worry, 2nd part will finish it up. Onto some \"keep your brain at home\" things. You will see Spiderman struggling to breathe when very high up in the air, which makes sense and all. BUT, later you see your super heroes move around in space on an alien planet / rock without even their masks. How are they even \"breathing\" up there? Where does the oxygen come from, if there's any in the atmosphere at all. I hope Honest Trailer guys will have the balls to point that out when they make one for this movie. Since Dr. Strange has the time stone, WHY on earth would he NEVER uses it to his advantage during the multiple battles with Thanos? Why not use the same time loop trick, \"Thanos, I've come to bargain!\" or at any other point in time? How does Thanos decide who will live and who will die? Is it just random after he snaps his finger or has he already chose those who will die? You just see some of the heroes and random people die while others live. WHY not kill ALL the superheroes in a snap if he has the power? The way \"Time Reversing\" works (at least in MCU and in theory too if it ever does). You reverse EVERYTHING that happened back to a previous point. For some reason, Thanos very conveniently just reverse the shattering of Soul Stone ONLY while everything else that happened during and after that just stays as it is. Once again, I hope Honest Trailers can point out this glitch in the matrix too. There will be plenty of MCU fans who will blindly rate this movie as 9 or 10 probably just like they watched the movie while keeping their brains at home but if you think even a little bit, this is FAR from perfect, the best MCU movie yet!, OMG this movie is EPIC, type of movies. It has it's flaws, you just need the courage of Captain America to see and admit it. :) This is the first MCU movie that I don't have the desire to watch it again. I am however waiting for the part 2 just to see how the story ends.", "This film is absolutely epic! Reading the reviews above I get the sense that these reviewers who didn't get it weren't really invested in all the build up since the first avengers movie. Let's be Clear here, this film delivers on every level. From the opening jaw dropping scene that sets the tone of what Thanos is about, to culmination of each character and franchise. Seeing Tony Stark trade egos with Dr Strange and star lord and to see captain America back in his less than 'boy scout' attire was growth enough and I don't think the story needed to spell out anymore than we'd already seen.  I haven't had my head blown off like this since the first avengers movie and The Dark Knight before that. If you can appreciate its loyalty to the original material and its beautiful narrative for the big screen then I think you're going to witness a masterpiece and also the best movie of the year.", "By the end of the movie, half audiences were gone. Must found it boring and left in the middle :\\\n.\n.\n.\n.\nOh wait a sec...", "Marvel sure know what they are doing. The storyline is well-designed. VFX scenes are super satisfying. Lovable heroes. Intimidating villain. Very creative in every way. So many characters yet handled so well. It was a visual feast to the eyes. I saw it in IMAX3D and it was just perfect. There might be a few goofs during the movie but hey, all movies have some. It is such a pleasure to see the development of Marvel's universe and heroes. They evolve through out the films in a best way possible. Totally recommend the movie.", "Best Marvel cinematic universe movie ever !! \nWith such a big cast .. and so much build up ... hype .. everyone expected the movie to disappoint . For me it didnt . It succeeded in all aspects . \nThe action and cgi was better than in any other marvel movie before. \nthe best villian in a marvel movie . the movie itself was emotional , let room to grow for some characters ..even tho i mean thanos especially cuz it was kind his movie ... but also gamora .. thor ... ironman .. had character moments. \nBlack Panther was a good movie for the first 30-60 mins but became shallow really quick.. it was more of a bad written and bad directed James Bond Marvel version to me, even tho the acting was pretty good.. but Infinity War felt like a true Marvel movie..", "The recast so genius\nthis movie\nmovie genius\nunpredictable\nbla\nbla\nbla", "Avengers Infinity War its more than good, its funny, exciting, sentimental and manages to find a balance when using its characters, thanos is a better villain of the MCU, and the truth revives by much my love for the genre of superheroes.", "Infinity War was just about as hyped as a movie can get. It had the most viewed online trailer ever, was #3 all time in pre-sales, and was first teased back in 2012 with The Avengers, and most of the MCU movies since then have all been building up to this. Ever since the Infinity Stones were first introduced in the first Thor movie, people have believed that we would see Thanos' quest to collect the all on the big screen. Perhaps most impressive is that it had the biggest opening weekend ever, beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the U.S. with $257,000,000, and beating Fate of the Furious globally with $640,000,000. Now, it's impossible to talk about this movie without spoilers, so be warned. \nGiven the sheer number of characters and plotlines in this movie, there's quite a bit to take in. It alternates between sets of characters such as Team Cap+Vision, the Thor/Rocket/Groot combo, the Guardians/Iron Man/Strange/Spidey combo, and, of course, Thanos himself. It's definitely true that there isn't enough screen time to go around, which for casual viewers, may be a problem. However, for fans of the MCU, it's fine. It doesn't introduce any new major heroes, so most of the character development already happened in the previous films in the franchise. It also has some good humor and several memorable lines (Get lost, Squidward!) There is some development to be had. Thor does deal with Loki's death and the aftermath of Ragnarok. There are new things happening with the Guardians. However, some characters, notably Captain America, Black Panther, and Bucky don't get enough screen time. If there was one thing this movie absolutely needed to get right, it was that Thanos had to be a great villain. And he was. On the outside, he was everything he needed to be; threatening, serious, cruel, intimidating, and still really believes that what he does is right. But yet on the inside, he does have some heart. Right after he kills Gamora, it really does seem like he's really heartbroken by it. Part of why the movie works is because Thanos is the central character. He gets the most screen time. It's called \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" but the Avengers aren't the central focus. This is really Thanos' story. The Black Order isn't really the best set of villains. But they are side villains, so it's fine that they don't get as much screen time. Ebony Maw was pretty cool. Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glave felt like glorified minions. Cull Obsidian was lame. Another part of why this movie works is because the stakes feel real. It subverts the tropes of heroes always winning, killing Loki and Heimdall in the first 10 minutes. Not only are the stakes there, but the situations where characters have to kill each other to prevent Thanos from getting a stone have a great amount of tension to them. (Star-Lord and Gamora, Doctor Strange and Iron Man, Vision and Scarlet Witch) You know they're not afraid to kill off their heroes. Whenever there's an action scene, there's the uncertainty angle. You don't know who's going to die, and it could very well be anyone.  The action scenes were absolutely spectacular. There are several of them, and they last for quite a while. The New York fight, which is Doctor Strange and Wong vs Ebony Maw and Iron Man and Spider-Man vs Cull Obsidian, was the first real fight, and a great, exciting action scene. The Battle of Wakanda wasn't as cool as we hoped, given how much it showed up in the trailers. Still, it was very fun to watch, very extensive, and has the same high stakes. Heck, it even delivers somewhat of a sword fight, between Okoye, Black Widow, and Proxima Midnight. Coming off Black Panther, though, it feels kind of rehashed, given that we saw this three months ago. The battle on Titan was probably the best. We saw a new Iron Man suit, new Doctor Strange powers, some Spider-Man one liners, and even Mantis gets in on the fun. And, of course, there's the part where Iron Man gets impaled. He lives, but it's shocking nonetheless. Then, of course, there's the elephant in the room - the ending. Holy crap. The shock factor was definitely there. I knew going in that there was a shocking ending. I thought it was either the Snap, or that Iron Man dies. The snap was absolutely devastating, taking out by my count, 6 Avengers, 4 Guardians, and others like Nick Fury and Maria Hill. I'd say the most shocking death was Black Panther. I thought he was untouchable given the popularity. But then again, by the time that came out, this movie was probably in post-production, so what can you do? Spidey's was really painful to watch. Doctor Strange hit hard personally. But it just felt cheap. Those of us who know the comics know that the snap got undone. You know they're coming back. There's no way in hell they'd kill off Spidey or Black Panther for real. But there's no other way to end it. Thanos was unbeatable with 5 stones, you can't have the whole movie be about #6. Plus, everyone who doesn't know the comics (which is the vast majority of the MCU audience) didn't expect it. The biggest spoiler they expected was that either Cap or Iron Man was going to die. But with the resurrections, it feels like anyone who died could come back. Except Heimdall. He's dead. Loki has \"died\" before. Gamora is in the Soul Stone. Vision could be rebuilt. But how else could this end? Like Doctor Strange said, this is the only way. Infinity War is quite the film. It's a lot to take in, but it's a very exciting, well paced film that delivers on most of the hype it's been building up to. Fans of the MCU will definitely enjoy it more than casual moviegoers, and some may find the ending leaves a bad taste. However, it's clearly a Part 1, and it will be interesting to see how it unfolds in Part 2.", "Yep, I said it, Many people are pissed upon watching the movie, and I understand the emotions there (No spoilers) but Jeez, Infinity War had me with a throbbing heart (even after the third time watching it) First of all, the Plot is brilliant, it broke down easily on the first time with few details I had to revisit the second and the third time, but it is brilliant, the movie did it boldly, and did it like no other super hero movie, One can say that giving the trends of Marvel movies plots, but this is like the highest you can go with stakes in a movie, it must be a gamble and yes it was for the directors\nI get why the ending was not everyone's favorite, but come on, there is a sequel, and the end is not what we would all expect, the ending was literally the last thing anyone thought, I feel like the directors did know what we were thinking and definitely surprised the hell out of us, but in all honesty, kuddos to the Russos, for interconnecting, engineering and building this masterpiece of a culmination, making all movies, all stories and all characters flow to this plot.\nSecond, Thanos, he has got to be like the longest for them to develop, to build a character so complex in his own thinking yet so simple in his feelings, building a villain is really hard, but creating a villain with a balance was plausible.\nThird, the production of this movie deserves 100 out of 10, the Visual effects are stunning, the action scenes are astronomical, the pace and the combustible stakes are just INSANE, I was really thinking wait How far can you take this and they did, take it to the highest extremes, I usually am very critical of production issues in a movie but this was remarkable\nLast, the actors have all been, without a doubt at their finest, Chris Evans is at his best, Downey was at his best, Vision was amazing, Ebony Maw was one of the most phenomenal characters, Hemsworth was sooooo EPIC, Pratt was at his best, Zoe Saldana did deliver memorably, Iron Man VS Dr Strange was one of the best chemistry on screen ever, which is usually a hard thing to do in a movie like this, and THANOS, my god that guy roared, breathed, cried and smirked like a VILLAIN, Brolin deserves at least multiple nominations for this Here is the summary for you, Avengers Infinity war is a SEQUEL, it stands by itself from a plot but is still dependant on what happened prior to it, A Masterpiece of acting, Chemistry, production and well engineered story, it is bold, it defies our expectations and it is pushing it towards Avengers 4 at a 200 Miles an hour, CAN'T WAIT!!!", "The only flaw I could find in this film is that it's best moments could be lost on the more casual fans of the MCU. Infinity War certainly rewards those who have spent years following the over-arcing story through the decade of 18 films. That said, Infinity War probably doesn't create many \"new\" fans, with the exception of those willing to watch the back catalogue. For those who have followed the MCU, Infinity War more than lives up to the anticipation and buildup of Thanos throughout the years. The stakes were not only high for the heroes in this film, but for the creative team who had to deliver on the work of countless others over the years. Infinity War May be the best summer popcorn flick I've ever seen! Ridiculously exciting, excruciatingly suspenseful, emotional and awe inspiring. The acting is great, the humor is on point and the villain Thanos is more than we could've hoped for. The CGI and effects were next level and I left the theater dying to see the next installment, as well as another viewing of Infinity War. I left with that feeling if stepping off a roller coaster and wanting to ride it again immediately!", "This Movie Feels Perfect from beginning to The end The Teams that Build up The Jokes everything is Amazing a Movie i whant to watch 2-3 Times in Cinema !", "I want to become thanos to eliminate half of humans in this world..", "The greatest asset of this action packed superhero saga is that not only it can stun you with many hair raising action and epic battle sequences but with the emotional grip that tones this fantastic film very well throughout the running time..\nEven, with the highly unlikable villain 'Thanos' the directors have managed to create emotionally tender moments giving quite a bit of a wider scope to how the villain is portrayed in this epic Marvel gem.\nEach an every major marvel Superhero gets to pay his/her contribution in fighting against the almighty evil 'Thanos' with convincing and rich performances majorly because of the wonderful screenplay adapted by C. Markus and Stephen McFeely.\nThe major sub plot turnouts and plot twist building up to the climax have been crafted so masterfully to create maximum impact on keeping the strong momentum in the flow of the plot.\nI must also admit that since the fantabulous and iconic Dark Knight trilogy by Christopher Nolan this is the next superhero movie in which I felt emotionally gripped with its storytelling and with amazing visual effects which in itself is a marvel to look at.\nDo not miss this epic saga by Russo brothers and regret it.", "It puts all of marvels other films to shame. This is truly incredible. I had my reserves because there was going to be so many people in it but it works. I need to see it again in the cinema.", "Nothing can prepare you for this cinematic event of a life time. \nWith 10 years of ambitious story telling and a teased villain, it's finally here!  It's time to assemble the team! \nWe have Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch, Vision, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Falcon, War Machine and more because I'm running out of breath!  After 160 minutes of this crazy rollercoaster the only words you'll be saying is \"Woah\", then you'll go straight back to the queue to buy another ticket. Yes infinity War does pay off.  Everyone gets their moments in the limelight. Tony Stark and Peter Parker, there's a fun nod to the movie Aliens and a squid ward joke too! Vision and Scarlet Romance, Bruce Banner talking to Hulk, Guardians meeting Thor and finally Captain and Black Widow, these pairs are a treat to watch. But this isn't all about the avengers, it's more about Thanos and his journey on hunting all 6 Infinity Stones to keep the universe in balance so that he can re-create all of creation in his monstrous image. We get a brief of his past, his lovely Gamora and what he will do to complete his destiny. Let's just say Thanos \"Throws\" away this relationship which has left Gamora feeling \"flat\" hehehehe.  You don't have to view all 18 MCU films, but they do help you keep track on what's going on like where the stones are, who this person is etc. It will make the experience much better and clearer.  This is an impressive achievement that they have accomplish, there's a lot going on this film and it's hard to even do a spoiler free review. \n \nThere are so many glorious moments in this film, from the jokes and banter to the insane action sequences in Wakanda and Thanos himself. I love how he starts off with armour then every time he collects a stone, a piece is fallen off. I even like the different abilities the gunlet has, it's nothing like you have ever seen before. But by far my favourite scene is the ending, it just ends. It may feel unfinished or feel like a half film, but it's more of a emotional punch that you'll never get over with.", "Avengers Infinity War isn't perfect, but it sure is one hell of a ride! This is a spoiler free review. I'll start off with elements that did not work for me (or at least, I thought, could've been better). There are a few VFX shots (such as fully-CGI characters, noticeable green screens, etc.) in the film that looked quite unpolished, but mostly very small aspects. But then again, the scope of the film is so huge that it seems impossible to fully render every element on every frame. Another element that felt quite lacking, for me, was the character development (especially for newcomers such as the Children of Thanos, and some heroes). No spoilers, but the purpose of the Black Order in the film is ultimately to serve as a physical threat for the heroes. Most of our beloved heroes have very little screen-time in this installment, both for the best and worse. However, there are some characters who get to shine more in this one.  Now, let's talk about what's great about the film! Surprise, surprise, surprise. There are tons of awesome surprises for the audience in this film, especially for die-hard MCU fans such as myself. Since 2012, fans have been anticipating to watch the Mad Titan, Thanos, wreak havoc and become a fully-realized, compelling villain. Let me say this: Thanos is easily one of the best MCU villains yet, ranking with the likes of Loki, Vulture and Killmonger. I would even say he's one of the best villains in a superhero movie ever. There's some emotional depth to the character, reinforced by Josh Brolin's amazing motion-capture performance and intricate details to his expressions and movements. Thanos truly dominates every frame he's in. Now, I want to give tons of credit to the writers (McFeely and Markus) and directors (the Russo Brothers) for giving Thanos such great care and purpose. Infinity War is ultimately Thanos' story, without questions. That is why, perhaps, some may feel that their favorite characters were under-used in the film. Ten years of build-up, and the Mad Titan gets the justice he deserves. While some characters take a back seat for the duration of the film, there are some who really get to shine (Iron Man's new suit is sick, Dr. Strange is more powerful than ever, Gamora plays quite a crucial role, and Thor!!!) Great character interactions (especially Dr. Stange, Spider-Man and Iron Man). The action sequences were fantastic - some work better than others. The final act of the film, in particular, was breath-taking. It genuinely felt like the MCU was at its peak. A couple of gut-wrenching moments scattered throughout the film. Tom Holland delivers one of the most heart-breaking performances in the MCU. Avengers: Infinity War truly felt like an action-packed, emotional and thrilling epic that will leave fans stunned and wanting more.", "If i sit the keyboard, i could create a better scenario for sure bruh.", "Just WOW! One of the best movies of 2019. The Infinity War is thrilling from start to end. The cast, effects, soundtrack, design, camera just everything is spot on .I expected to be disappointed, but this movie delivers on all fronts. Thanos is the best villain ever introduced and thankfully not only feels completely real in the CGI but also capture every last detail of Brolin's performance. The Russo brothers did great job. And that ending blew my mind straight to the universe, AMAZING Marvel's masterpiece.", "Absolutely loved it, the movie has so many amazing actors/actresses. Well done Marvel", "Some of the acting is terrible. Ruffolo is way out of his league, while others were fantastic.", "Although visually cool, the story is full of flaws only help a poorly deisgned plot. \nHeroes are nvincible or weak when needed by the story, Thanos is randomly cruel or nice, stones are used only when the story needs them... If you are able to totally shut down your brain for more than 2 hours, you might like some GCIs.", "What the devil won icant blive that I waste my time for thanos and all heroes are gone .. what's happening people \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude29", "Just like with Star Wars Episode VIII the latest Avengers are all about meaningless fussing around. A lot of familiar characters, a lot of action, a ton of CGI, a bunch of drama and tragedy... But nobody had any specific plan, they just tried to stop Thanos, period. Planning is not for superheroes, come on, right? And instead of analysing forces posture and making at least an imitation of plan, they acted impulsively like a dispersed group of amateurs or even kids. Above all that they didn't even have a clue about what was gonna happen very soon. The only meaningful move was Dr. Strange's decision to back off and let Thanos to win the battle - and that wasn't a result of long thinking through! Doctor just sat on his ass, spent a couple of seconds just to count possible outcomes and saying nothing waited until the very end. Coooooool!!! It's like they never heard of Thanos before and had no idea who he is and what he's capable of. Again and again, I catch myself thinking that Disney doesn't count on adults - they make movies for youngsters who aren't supposed to think on what they see. The more special effects, running, riding, fighting, shooting and meaningless death of favorite characters (hoping that they're gonna revive in the next movie, of course), the better box office results are. I'm disappointed with this comic circus. The first Avengers were almost a masterpiece (my respect to Joss Whedon). But this one is a total mess.", "Well, it's all started with a big hit operation credit, then it's all came with the most exciting action sequence in the MCU. I have no comment on the movie until the final fight, which it was so short but thrilling. Then I saw Thanos weak... So weak. I wanted to see more avengers vs Thanos. The ending was great, exciting and thrilling. Which is makes me so excited and impatient to see the next avengers movie, which I hope it has an epic final fight. But it really is the best movie in the MCU.", "I don't even know where to begin to describe how much I enjoyed this film. Let's start by saying that if you read reviews, please do not take the criticisms that say this film is without a plot, and those who did not understand what was going on in the film. Because it's really not true. The film makes you feel so many things: from pain, laughter, sadness, a little more laughter and more sadness.\nOf all the movies of Marvel it is definitely the best one.\nAnd to see the variety of characters in the film - absolutely amazing. Pure pleasure. The film leaves us with a lot of questions, especially about Marvel's future. This film is highly recommended for viewing with the whole family, and only with those who know the stories of Marvel -\nThat they will not tell you later: \"I did not understand\" or \"There is no plot here\"\nAnd I very much hope that you will enjoy and be filled with emotions like me.", "A nice movie to watch. Probably the best marvels movie yet.", "This movie is absolutly amazing. The history proves that once you try to make more than few heroes an more than one storyline, the movie become mess. But brothers russo created an amazing movie with deep, emotional story that the last 10 has led to, with over 30 characters they created a stable running plot that does not stop for a secound. Thanos is one of cinema best bad guys ever with a real agenda and complex conflicts that make it very complicated to not agree and the deep of the character made Thanos-the villain to movie main character and he is the one who gives the tune for the movie.\nVisually, the movie is avsoulotly georges. The visual effects and characters customs look just real and i have no complain for it\nI have no bad word to say about the movie so go and see it.", "Avengers Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie of all time. From beginning to end, I had a grin on my face. The beginning scene with Thor, Loki and Thanos was a great scene with true emotion and feel, but what I didn't like was that Loki has all of these powers that he could've used against Thanos, but he decided to stab him. This just doesn't make sense. I liked the scene with Dr Strange, Tony, Bruce and Wong was very great and their battle was better. Thor with the guardians was a great scene, Spider-Man with Iron Man was great, and all of the other Avengers in Wakanda was all great. When Thanos sacrifices Gamora to get the Soul Stone, you could see that he was genuinely upset and didn't want to, but he had to. And then the battle on Titan didn't have a single thing wrong with it, and you could see the genuine anger in Star Lord when he realizes what happened to Gamora. And then the end scene once Thanos snapped, it had so much emotion and was so unexpected that loud uproar in the theater made it even better. This was a great movie and I cannot wait for Avengers 4", "This movie begins to pit our heroes against a great menace .It delivers on the action and funny jokes to juxtapose against the great tradegy. At its climax the stakes are raised higher than ever before in any superhero movie. It ended with sad note that proganists do not always win", "The best movie, the action is the best of the last 15 years.", "A charismatic soldier and a villain that you can't hate.", "This is a superhero movie, and for the his category is a great great movie . Dont listen the idiots and the ridiculous arguments of them, really is very easy to answer to them but is waste of time. See and enjoy this movie for what really is, a superhero movie and more.", "The story of movie is very intriguing & to be honest unpredictable (which is very rare nowadays) But the movie has some odd things like, (Wakanda the most powerful nation) is fighting without any machine guns looks a bit odd.\nBut I am not here to tell the story.\nThe movie is great and has prefectly depicted the emotions of the characters. There are various emotional instances in the film which makes you feel sad about them.\nA must watch for a Marvel FAN even a DCEU fan should watch it. \nAs usual like other Marvel movie suffers from soundtrack.", "I dont have words for describe it, the best super hero movie of the all the times! Just it ^^", "Was good like all advenger movies. Had good story and action", "Infinity war was something that The MCU has been building up to for 10 years now!! Trust me when I say it wasn't a let down, This third installment in the Avengers Series Is absolutely incredible, Now like every movie it wasn't a flawless film, with 1 or 2 dragged scenes, and Some huge Plot holes! But besides all that The film was Amazing and cant wait till it hits Blu Ray so I can watch it over and over!!!", "I love it. Everything in the movie, except for a visual effect shot with Bruce Banner in the Hulkbuster suit near Avengers: Infinity War's ending, is perfect. The stakes are higher and, for me, Thanos is the MCU's best and most compelling villain than Killmonger and Hela.", "Decent comic book movie, but way overrated. This should have been spread out over a few movies instead of Thanos just steamrolling over everyone and everything. Thanos was a way better character in this movie.", "Worth it! 10 years of MCU!\nMakes your feelings and mind blow.", "World-shaking events are kid stuff in \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" the first installment of a two-part sequel to \"The Avengers\" and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" The whole universe is under attack from Thanos, an infinitely villainous villain sporting a multicleft, prognathous chin. Universe-shaking throwdowns succeed one another with truly stupefying regularity as the Avengers and their Guardians of the Galaxy allies take turns rising to the challenge. But moments that touch the heart are few and far between in this almost-culmination of a decade of Marvel Comics movies. The finale, scheduled for release in May 2019, may well bring the adventure to fittingly grand fruition. What's on screen now, however, is table-setting for events to come, a groaning board of superheroes, a superabundance of undifferentiated superpowers, and an ending that's more exciting than anything that precedes it.", "This movie is incredible!!!! It has the perfect balance of comedy, action, drama, and romance. First, the romance. The movie doesn't just include romance that characters have for each other, such as Wanda and Vision and Quill and Gamora. But also how the two teams care for each other. How Tony wants to keep Peter safe, or the friendship(or something more) between Steve and Bucky. How Thor mourns for Loki or how Gamora was willing to give up the location of the Soul Stone to save Nebula. They all have a connection to each other. An unbreakable connection. Next, the comedy. This movie was packed full of it. It wasn't too much, but not too little either. Most of it comes from the Guardians of course. How Quill envies Thor or how Drax for some reason is invisible. There's also comedy between Stark and Strange here and there. It's enough to keep us through the drama. Which brings me to the drama part. There's A LOT of drama in this movie. Lots of parts that make you want to crawl into a hole and cry for hours. Mostly, the deaths. There were multiple deaths, such as Wanda, Vision, Bucky, Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Quill, Loki(though I don't believe it), Groot, Strange, and of course, one of the most heartbreaking, Peter Parker. I cried a lot, even though we think they're not dead for good. They basically just disappeared for now. And now, the action. There were lots of action scenes. Why wouldn't there be, this is an action movie. The scene where Cap, Nat, and Sam came back or the Wakanda fight. This movie was the perfect balance of everything we love and the things we would prefer not to experience. All in all, this movie was spectacular. I give 10 stars to the Russo brothers. Good job. Hope the second part is just as good. Maybe even better. Guess we'll have to wait 'till May 3rd 2019 to find out.", "About a month ago I watched Avengers: Infinity War. I've been a fan of Marvel before the Cinematic Universe begin in 2008. After many Installments from Marvel, Infinity War lives up to the real hype compared to it's predecessors. We follow the point of view of multiple major Marvel Characters, The movie has a great line of characters and actors portraying their roles at their best. Thanos is one of the most complex villains in the entire marvel cinematic universe, Josh Brolin delivers the Mad Titan Thanos from the comics perfectly. \n \nThe Story has a very different style to it, as we focus on our characters we realize that our greatest heroes have thought this would be a victory like the other battles they fought but for the first time in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Avengers we're defeated and suffered from one of the most traumatic losses compared to any Superhero film that shows a character defeated by his antagonist. The movie will be having a Part II.  Now I hope that the Academy Awards will this time look at this film not only as a block buster with worthy visual effect. But I hope they see it as a film that changes Superhero movies forever.  10/10 A Flat Out Masterpiece since The Dark Knight!", "Great movie, best Marvel film yet. Thank you for not being predictable like all the haters seem to want", "I cant say anything about this film..\nafter watch this... i cant wait for next avengers trilogy. PERFECT!", "Okay Disney cats out of the bag that the gifted screenwriters under your thumbs are writing the MCU movies and the thus far way over-hyped flops have screwed up the Star Wars films except Rogue One which wasn't that hard to write being its the crawl to \"A New Hope\". Solos' uninteresting story combined with fact only Harrison Ford is / can be Han Solo, same will show in the recast of Indiana Jones. They would have been better off going way of CGI'd Han Solo voiced by Ford. There was just lame awkwardness from everything out of whatshisnames' mouth, so there was no chance for the lack of weight story within Star Wars Universe. All the would have been interesting backstory was just referred to in conversation like Han's days in Imperial Academy. Could you have imagined the mouths drop if they would have revealed Han's pilot instructor as the Dark Monolith himself, 'Vader'. Any chance for a Vader scene anywhere should be jumped on. It's what puts Rogue One in top three Star Wars films with Empire no.1 and A New Hope and Rogue I consider tied.", "THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!\nRusso brothers have done exceptional job. Everything thing, every piece, every character was used so perfectly that it created Exitement of what will happen next. And I can't wait to see part II.", "I was absolutely blown away by this movie. It was just as I had hoped it would be! I imagined a much darker feel to it and it definitely delivered!!", "I want to start off this review by giving each and every person who reads it some advice. There are 3 things you must do/understand for this movie to be fantastic. 1. This movie is titled \"Avengers Infinity War\" not \"Black Panther 2\" the amount of reviews I have seen that slam this movie for it's limited time in Wakanda with the cast of Black Panther is absolutely daunting. Black Panther got a movie two months prior to this film. It is absolutely OK for a movie to not focus solely on a character that just got their own 2 hours of fame. 2. If you haven't watched the other MCU movies leading up to this film I ask you a simple question. Why even go see this movie? Sure, you know who Captain America is because you have a crush on Chris Evans or yeah you know who Black Widow is because you have a crush on Scarlett Johansson. However, that does not mean you truly know/understand the story or characters going into this film. you absolutely at bare minimum need to watch 1 Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy movie before going into Avengers Infinity War. 3. There is going to be a part two for this movie. Lots of the blind hate I am seeing for this film is that the ending \"Ruins Everything\" and half of these people dont understand that next year we are getting Avengers 4 (which no one knows anything about btw. Its all just speculation at this point.) WIth that out of the way I can now start my review. Also be warned, there are spoilers in this review beyond this point. Avengers Infinity War is a nonstop ride from the first scene all the way to the final end credits sequence. Lets break this film down by the story lines of the characters involved. Tony: For years Tony has been cursed with the knowledge of the upcoming doom for the team. After his last minute decision to throw that missile into the portal in New York six years prior, Tony has had mass PTSD. In this film there is a two year time jump since the events of Captain America: Civil War. Pepper and Tony are preparing for their wedding when he is visited by Steven Strange where he gets a crash course on the Infinity Stones and a visit from Bruce Banner, whom he hasn't seen since Age of Ultron. Tony and his team are trust into battle ending with Steven, Peter, and Tony all on an alien U.F.O. headed to Titan. Tony's big moments comes when he is fighting Thanos one on one and he realizes that the mad titan knows him from similar visions before he is stabbed in the gut with his own blade. However, he survives to the end.  Steve Rogers: Captain America is back in a sense as the new character Nomad. Cap doesn't act on anyone's authority other than his own. This doesn't stop him from coming back when his team needs him. Steve's real purpose in this film is to introduce Wakanda to the rest of the team after his time there after the events of Civil War. Steve also survives. Thor: This film opens with Thor watching as Thanos kills his brother Loki with a neck snap and his best friend Heimdall with a blade to the heart. When we next see Thor he literally crashes into the windshield of The Guardians of the Galaxy. Thor soon separates from the majority of the team alongside Groot and Rocket to go to Nidavellir to forge a new hammer after his sister destroyed Mjolnir in Thor Ragnarok. Thor reveals his past to Rocket in one of the movies most heartfelt scenes (Which also shows that Chris Hemsworth and Bradley Cooper make a fantastic on screen team). Thor is 1,500 years old. He has killed at least double that amount. He watched his Father, Brother, Sister, Mother, and Best Friend die. His girlfriend left him. His original love interest was killed along with his team. But, he is ready to become the man he needs to be for those he loves. After a quick eye patch up from Rocket and discovering the star he forges his weapons at has gone dark Thor does what he has to for the weapon to be forged almost killing himself in the process. Once Stormbreaker is forged he goes back to earth just in time to help Steve and his team win in Wakanda. Thor survives as well. Peter Parker: Poor Peter is in this movie only to become an Avenger and then die. However, Tom Holland absolutely nails his role in this film. Also the Iron Spider suit is completely badass and honestly worth the price of admission alone if you're a Spider Man fan like myself.  Peter Quill: I completely understand what they did with Star Lord in this movie, They showed he was insecure and impulsive. However, in doing so they make him seem more like a whiny child than a grown man, which after a few scenes becomes a bit too much. Peter's one good scene is with Gamora when she is taken by the mad titan himself on the planet Knowhere. Chris Pratt did all he could with the script he had, but it just wasn't enough for me and is a reason this film gets a 9/10 instead of a 10/10. I just didn't care when he died. Gamora: Possibly the character that grows the most in this film is the daughter of Thanos, Gamora. Throughout the movie you learn of the secrets Gamora has kept such as the location of the Soul Stone on Vormir, Gamora is a broken woman who in her final moments before she is sacrificed by Thanos for the Soul Stone as instructed by the surprise comeback of Red Skull as the guardian of the stone after he was sucked into the portal at the end of the first Captain America movie.  Vision: The most important character on earth is The Vision. He has a literal Infinity Stone in his forehead. After Thano's Black Order tracks him down in Scotland he is saved by Captain America and taken to Wakanda so that he can have the stone removed so that his lover Scarlet Witch can destroy it given that her powers literally come from the stone itself. This doesn't work out which leads to Wanda having to kill the man she loves in a heartbreaking scene before watching as he is brought back via the Time Stone and killed once more by Thanos giving him the final Infinity Stone. Thanos: I have been saving this character for a reason. There are very few villains in movies that reach this level of excellency. This is Marvel's answer to Heath Ledger's Joker in Batman The Dark Knight. Josh Brolin is a fantastic actor. Not only did he pull this role off seamlessly, he also was a perfect Cable in Dead Pool 2 which released a few weeks later. Thanos is smart He predicted the death of his planet and proposed a mass genocide at random of half the population in order to save the lives of those remaining. When his planet Titan fell into death he waged war on the universe hell bent on receiving all six Infinity Stones so that he could wipe out half of all life. He destroys the Nova core for the Power Stone, He kills Loki for the Space Stone, He kills The Collector for the Reality Stone, He is given the Time Stone as a peace offering from Doctor Strange, He kills Vision for the Mind Stone, and he sacrifices his favorite daughter Gamora the only person he loves for the Soul Stone. In the end he is stabbed in the heart by Thor, but not before he can snap his fingers and literally wipe out half of all life in the universe. The film ends with him sitting on his porch watching out over a grateful universe just as he predicted.  All in All I am happy that i've seen this film six times and I would go back in a heartbeat to see it a seventh.", "I had to go to the doctor after... Didn't blink once for 3 hours so my eyes wouldn't close! Amazing storyline, great interaction between the characters and probably the best movie i've seen since LOTR, about 15 years ago!!! That's enough said...", "I hope you never enjoy marvel movies again in your life.\nYour review is boring as Justice League. I think you enjoy cartoon better and DC movies.", "Waited till May 11th to see it on IMAX in mainland China. The theatre was filled. The line of people waiting winded outside into the mall. People were excited before they went in, and hyped after they came out. The best cinematic experience ever.\nThere were indeed a lot of characters, each and everyone of them loved by so many fans, had their moments in the movie. Some has more screen time, some less, but not even one second was bad. All the pieces and moments were good, in a way that it either pushes the story line or build up the characters. \nAs someone who's more fond of the original Avengers, I do have some complaints about the Guardians' lengthy journey compared to the short appearance of my beloved Steve Rogers and Black Widow. But if you take the storyline into consideration, the Guardians were indeed more intertwined into the plot. So I understood what the directors wanted to do.\nBut, again, why can't there be more backstory about what Steve Rogers and Black Widow did after the Civil War? Instead, I had to look at someone eating snacks for over a minute~ I laughed at that scene, but, I still wished that I had seen more of Steve Rogers and Black Widow after waiting sooo long for this Averagers film.\nEven though I still LOVED this movie. It's definitely going into my blue-ray collection.", "This movie is one of the best I have seen in a while. The chemistry between characters is amazing (best was Doctor Strange and Ironman) and the action was incredible. Thanos is not like other Marvel villains he thinks he is saving the world and he cares. The cameos were spot on and didn't feel awkward about them and the story itself was phenomenal. The ending was probably the best and worst part of the movie and once it ends you won't be able to stop thinking about it. The one problem with this is that it will not be a good movie if you haven't seen the other big MCU movie. 11/10", "This is a really good action movie, but it has a rather large hole in the plot which is not irreconcilable, but it needs to be explained.\nDr. Strange claims he has seen millions of futures and they win in only one, making one think that he had to let Thanos have the time stone... 'it was the only way'.\nBut they appear to just about have Thanos separated from the gauntlet (it appeared to have just come off) when Starlord loses it after hearing that Gamora is dead. Starlord losing it, appears to give Thanos the opportunity to regroup and hold onto the gauntlet. You have to believe that Dr. Strange saw this future (he did this before Thanos showed up), so it would appear that they just have to contain Starlord so that his stupidity does not give Thanos a chance to regroup. I have to believe that this will be addressed somehow when the sequel is released. If it is not, I will be very disappointed. Star Wars went off the rails when the three prequels were released (presenting us with stuff that did not make sense). I have never been a fan of 'if we write it, the public will swallow it' writing. Marvel studios has stayed away from this potentially, up until now, and underestimating the intelligence of your audience has never been a good recipe for making money. I say Marvel Studios, since Marvel the publisher has gone down this road before with the result being that Marvel had to talk fast and trying to recover (and in the process, doing more harm than good).\nThis cannot be ignored!!!\nI did like the fact that Fury appears to call Captain Marvell (hopefully the original) at the end, setting up Captain Marvell to finally make an appearance.", "Many questions I am sure are intentional, but, many I bet will never be answered and just left to assumption...which is annoying given flow from previous films. How is Hulk so easily overpowered by Thanos (yes, I know in most cases Thanos would overpower him), but, then teen Spiderman, Iron Man, and company can hold him in place long enough for Mantis to try and calm him while they try to remove the Infinity Gauntlet? I find it a bit ridiculous. Not to mention, Hulk took much harder beatings from Abomination and Thor without being knocked out, yet, Thanos gives a throat chop, some body shots, and body slams him into unconsciousness? That ship's floor is harder than the arena walls on Sakaar? Harder than the gladitorial hammers? Harder than Mjolnir? Harder than every cement wall, steel object, explosive object and even the ground itself that Hulk has been smashed into or with? It just doesn't jive. It should have at least lasted a little longer and made the Black Order a little more concerned. Who are the Black Order? I know who they are from comics and reading about them, but the movie offers no explanation of them or their unique gifts or station with Thanos. Thanos does mention \"the Maw\" once. No development. Asgardians. \nStill no explanation of Where Lady Sif is and whether or not she died from Hela, Surtur, was on the ship, or was off world during all of this and is still alive (until possibly \"The Snap\"). \nValkyrie, Korg, Maek. Same thing. They were on the ship, at least at some point. Asgard was destroyed. The ship is all that is left of Asgardian people, with possible exception of some being off world during Hela's attack. Then the ship is destroyed, implying all Asgardians are dead, with known exception of Thor. Then later Thor mentions that half his people were killed. HALF? From what we saw, it was ALL. So if there were escape, hopefully it is acknowledged in the next film. Somehow, with this merrygoround of directors of Marvel films, I doubt it. And if Thanos can will away with a snap, half the universe, why wouldn't he be certain to include those that may challenge him in the future? Like Thor. I'd have liked to have seen more about the dwarves.", "The difference between Marvel and DC seems to be the lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek, clever and entertaining writing, directing and acting that Marvel has vs the dark, gloomy, pretentious plots, writing, directing and acting of the latest DC movies. I love the Marvel characters (intelligent, quick and witty) and how the movies seamlessly weave the characters/stories together to come to this huge climatic \"war\", with a cliffhanger ending that makes us eager for more. Can't wait for the next one. (Admittedly, I reviewed the wrong movie here first and it wouldn't let me delete my review, only edit it, so this is short and sweet.) Clever, exciting addition to the Marvel saga In My Humble Opinion!", "A solid narrative undertaking that explores the singular ambition of a titan to reshape the universe to his own liking. This Avengers movie brings together the threads created by the various parts of MCU into one big movie that needs a whole other movie to complete its full story.", "For a non-Marvel follower like me, this movie was too much for my senses. I did enjoy the effects and much of the action(atleast those that involved the characters Wanda or Vision because I found their relationship adorable) but felt for a sci-fi movie that's intention is to simply entertain, this one took itself too seriously and has left audience like me wondering that things could have been kept really simple. I wanted to be entertained the old fashioned way - a bunch of super heroes on Earth save the planet from a huge, aggressive, alien guy(or whatever Thanos is). Fight against him & finally destroy him, that's it. But here the story takes on many layers, I think with the objective to stimulate our minds and keep up thinking deeply about the characters. But these are comic characters, why complicate them? Maybe Marvel comics are for adults, not for kids. And I thought comics are created with primarily kids in mind... The performances, music, effects, action - all were mighty impressive(with whatever herculean budget that must have been offered, they better be) yet because these type of complex story telling is not my cup of tea, I rate the movie a 6/10. Verdict - if you are a Marvel fan, you'd probably love it I guess. Others, I wouldn't recommend it. Give me a B-grade monster movie any day.", "The first thing i want to tell marvel finally did it, but the film started action very early.\nThats enough to say about this movie, this film unearth our all emotes.", "I decided to watch this film because I saw it had a 9.2 on IMDB. In my head a film with that score must be good. The hype around this film leaves me utterly disappointed. There is little moral behind the story, cheesy lines, a poor script, stupid unrealistic action. I watched it thinking it had a chance to be as good as Batman the Dark Knight because it holds a similar rating. It is crap! It should be rated 6.4 not 9 or 8. There are to many egos following a plot that sends you across galaxies that are hard to follow. The difference to this film and a great film is that it has no purpose behind it. The batman trilogy was amazing because it can show how to beat the struggles of life. But this, I don't even know what this is. But if its the best hollywood have to offer. Then films are on a decline. We need more meaningful, realistic superhero films. Not action packed. The dark knight trilogy got it spot on. Marvel has had it wrong since 2008.", "The thrilling action, the most numerous superheroes in one movie, all whit his previews introductions in other movies. Excellent in all aspects", "Another great Marvel movie that has no dull moments at all. It always has you on the edge of your seat and adds a lot to the MCU. It also leaves you on a major cliffhanger making you want more. Looking even more forward to the next Marvel movies.", "Amazing how they balance all the characters and still manage to make an action packed understandable and comprehensive story. Thanos is the best villain in the MCU.", "I see lot of negative comments from DC fans and ppl who hv seen an avengers movie without following the mcu movies all these years. Firstly this is 19th movie of MCU series, simply put its like watching 4th season of breaking bad. So u will miss the plot if u haven't seen the other movies. Secondly it's thanos home coming, yeah it's difficult to see our favorite avengers disintegrate but for the first time thanos proved to be the super villain they deserve. Now that the villain has landed, it will be interesting to see next mcu movies like captain marvel and ant man, to see how the plot expands to next infinity war movie 2019. I did feel there was a flaw. Now that thanos has destroyed half of earth/universe, in a scene were he says he will finally rest, my question is what will be his urge to fight back the avengers when they come back for retribution? I will wait this question out until 2019.", "I went into this film like I had Age of Ultron. Thinking that this will top the original Avengers. Unlike Age of Ultron, which i walked away thinking \"it was good but not better than the original\", this film exceeded all expectation. The Russo Brothers delivered a beautiful tragic story that will leave you not believing what you've seen. MCU writers have given us one of the most feared and hated villains of all time. This film was not a slapped together at a drop of a hat and attempt to make money. This is a ten year work of art. This was a well planned movie that began from Fury walking out of the shadows in Starks Living room in Iron Man and came to a close with Fury turning to Ash. The best acted MCU movie by far that is lead by Downey Jr., Saldana, Hemsworth, and Brolin. I appreciate how this was planned from the beginning and not attempted after one big money making movie and someone said let's milk this for what it's worth. Thank you for giving us a phenomenal film that will be in everyone's top ten for years to come. I hold a select few in what I call special. This is one of them.", "Epic just amazing cast and well build up script. A mixture of emotion and action...", "This movie is the most interesting one I've ever seen.", "As close to a perfect movie that I have seen. The stellar mix of comedy and drama helped to pace this movie to where there were no parts that felt as if they dragged on too long. I would have given it a 10, but the special effects lacked in bits. It was expected but still a negative. Go see this. Seriously. The best payoff to a long buildup ever.", "If there is something which is better than this movie, then that must belong to different galaxy or different planet, as I can definitely declare the film as the best film of earth. Direction 10 on 10\nActors portrayed the characters perfectly and flawlessly. No Spoiler! Please go and watch the film. But yeah, please watch the all 18 films before watching the movie.", "This movie is one of the top movies on this site, and rightfully so. The majority has spoken, so pay no attention to the anti-Marvel trolls who are rating this movie a 1 star. I'm an unbiased reviewer here because I am not normally a comic fan. I have to say that I have seen this film first hand and was thoroughly entertained. I was dragged here by my boyfriend but surprisingly enjoyed it. Great storyline, insane CGI, excellent fight scenes, drama, comedy, just about everything. Seeing this in 3D is even better. 10/10 and nothing less", "This is an easy film to spoil, so I will keep it brief. Thanos (Josh Brolin) gathers a group of bad guys with the quest of obtaining all the infinity stones. His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film.  The film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending. The production works with 3 subplots for much of the feature. The ending...well we know what happens next with a go back in time and let's hose this series up like they did X-Men.", "Starting with the positives, I thought the film was an overall blast. I was engaged and entertained throughout, and never was I losing my attention. I felt there was clear motivation for the villain, who (unlike most MCU villains), had some personality behind him. The acting and filmography were great, however it's the narrative that for me, restricted this movie to an 8, rather than a 10.\nFor me, no film should be worthy of a 10, if it includes a disposable CGI army. The first avengers had the Chitauri, the second Ultron bots, and this one, some mad 4-armed aliens. They had no backstory or motive, and only provided action sequences. There was no emotional connection, and I was disappointed that Marvel has allowed this to happen in every single Avengers film to date. \nFurthermore, this film is unable to stand on its own. Having seen most MCU films, I knew who each of the pre-established characters was, their motives, personalities, etc. However, trying to learn who everyone was from the film alone leaves a lot to be desired. I know people will argue that more or less nobody is going to see solely Infinity War, but it just doesn't hold up as a well as other franchises, where later films do not require the rest to stand on their own - e.g. Back to the Future, The Dark Knight trilogy, etc. People who haven't gone to see every Marvel film may be lost, and those who I went with didn't have any investment in some of the characters. \nI would also give the film a lot of credit for balancing the characters as well as they did, but having characters who are very light hearted , mixing with those who were quite dark, and jumping between them felt disorientating. Ultimately this was the curse of the MCU expanding so much, but other films have juggled multiple groups of heroes' quests much better - e.g. The Lord of the Rings trilogy. \nHulk's disappearance was also poorly done. Though I understood that being beaten by Thanos would have reduced his confidence, it doesn't fit his character in the past. When Thor blasted Hulk in Ragnarok, Hulk simply became angrier that he was losing. Hulk also refused to come back, despite Thanos not actually being there - referring to the last fight - so why didn't he come back then, when he knew he could beat one of Thanos' henchmen. Also, when the Hulk lost to the Hulkbuster, nothing stopped Banner hulking-out again. The film only needed a brief dialogue between Banner and Hulk, so explain why the Hulk was afraid to come out. It's absence irritated me, and undermined the character. \nFinally, Thanos' quest has been overdone in the past, and didn't carry the same weight, due to more logical alternatives being easily plausible within the film. For the former, the (now exhausted) plot of the villain wiping out huge numbers of people, for the benefit of those who survive, is an easy way for scriptwriters to justify their villain's actions. However, Thanos needed something more original. Batman Begins and Watchmen are both relatively recent superhero movies, that had this plot (though in the first, the villain fails, and in the second, the villain succeeds). For me, this narrative became stale after the first Kingsman film did it. Now for the latter, the powers of even only half of the infinity stones, would undermine Thanos' entire plan. The abilities of the reality stone, means that it can transform matter. Therefore, it should be able to transform any 'waste' matter, into food. This would give the universe far more longevity than just killing half of its occupants, and would be better morally. Thanos would be more than capable of this. \nThough the film was great fun, and I would definitely recommend it, Thanos' objective is incorrect and pointless, Hulk is essentially removed from the film with no explanation,it has some pacing and tonal issues, and the CGI monsters was bland. Although many of my complaints will be seen as nitpicks by the average movie-goer", "I think this is the strongest marvel's movie , a lots of events with no boring", "Great popcorn movie! Action, humor, picture, everything on its right place. Of course it's not the one I'm going to see again and again, but very good choice for weekend evening", "Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film. But (currently) sitting #10 on the top 250 list is insanity! \n\"Oh but a lot of heroes died and it was sad.\" The fact that 'Black Panther 2' and whatever they're calling the Spider-Man sequel, is definitely happening proves that 'Infinity War Part 2' will see the return of everyone who faded to dust. \nI get the Russo brothers can direct a good action film, and they have. They proved that with 'The Winter Soldier', (which is my opinion, is their best). But people who rate this 9 or 10 out of 10 should really see more films. It's above 'The Empire Strikes Back' ffs!!\nI get the 'Dr Strange' having to give up the infinity stone to lead towards the '1/however many millions' outcome... But come on, 'Days of Future Past', 'Back to the Future Part 2'... It'll be fixed by Dr Strange in Part 2.  So again, this is rated higher that T2, Back To The Future, Goodfellas, Se7en etc... Insanity!", "This movie was a masterpiece. I haven't seen such a good movie in such a long time. Avengers Infinity War exceeded my expectations. I was expecting an awesome movie filled with superheroes, but what I got was arguebly the best superhero movie to date. Every ounce of the way there is action. There is comedy. You will even cry. The end is near, and you should go watch.", "Before I seen the movie I new it would be great, but when I left the theatre I thought it was mind blowing epic! \nIt was definitely the best MCU movie of all time! It was definitely more intense then other MCU films but it was also greater, and it is a marvel movie so it has some humour threw out. It would has every thing I like in a movie.  Most people who aren't really into the MCU will not understand the end. But me I'm a huge MCU fan. If you are going to see this movie in theatres you will want to see captain America civil war before you go see it. \nFrom the beginning to the end it was so exciting and stressful, a little dark at some parts,  The marvel cinematic universe is going great, some people think that maybe this was the end of the MCU but it's not they have so much more planed.  So this movie deserves a ten star rating.", "What can I say? Phenomenal!\nThe Russo brothers bought a sharp real edge to the MCU with their previous Captain America movies (Winter Soldier and Civil War) and were able to get past the superheroes to the people underneath. They've done the same with mad Titans and intergalactic shenanigans. And like previous instalments, they're not afraid to tear things up in the process!\nThe opening scenes show how devastating Thanos can be with his bear hands...let alone a full gauntlet. and with shocking deaths from the onset it really is a gritty rollercoaster ride. I was gripped from start to finish and the clever balancing of all the different arcs and events happening concurrently made the immense run-time of the movie fly by. \nFrom human heroes, to wizards, Thunder Gods and Galactic Guardians, everybody gets their time to shine and their part to play. It is testament to the actors who know their characters and the Russos for delivering, but you really do sense that everybody has some weight in this battle.\nSeeing Thor back to best after the too light-hearted Ragnarok (in my opinion) was refreshing. and Doctor Strange take a very central role alongside Iron Man is great. Thanos really steals the show though. All of the heroes have had their stories told - this is his. and as it's slowly revealed throughout the movie you can't help but hope he succeeds.\nCaptain America wasn't as forefront as i expected but with part 2 to follow next year there is time for his swan song. I also thought Tony and Peter may have reacted more to being flung through space to an alien world. Apart from that and the absence of Hawkeye and Ant-Man, i cannot fault this movie.\nIt felt like a Marvel comic on the screen. The humorous quips amid fast-paced high-stakes battles. The looming and very real threat. The not-knowing who you'll see and when. This movie didn't just please a 10 year MCU fan, it wowed a lifelong Marvel fan.", "As someone whose been watching marvel since the first Iron man, this truly held up to my expectations. I gasped, I laughed, and I cried.", "I'm pretty sure this is a movie where the roles are reversed and the avengers are obviously the bad guys", "I've been watching so many \"artistic\" movies lately, and although those are great in their own way- in my opinion what a movie should really be about is escapism while conveying a message. The message in Infinity War is clear: everyone is united and fighting against some united cause. There is hope in humanity after all despite all the chaos. The critics have been slamming this movie due to it being too \"chaotic\" and completely missing the importance of having chaos in this movie. It's almost like an invisible side-character The humour is one of the wittiest and funniest i've seen in a Marvel movie so far and it's clear that they put a lot of effort and time into this movie.  Why are the critics so hard on a movie that simply wants to entertain before patronizing? I've watched many \"critically acclaimed\" movies lately and they have just made me feel depressed, drained out of hope, and the message was contrived yet concealed in some wishy-washy, snobby, elitist and morally assumptive package. Infinity War isn't about that. It's about how YOU perceive hope in times of danger, while not being afraid to go into the unknown. To fight the most evil man out there. Marvel did a great way of portraying teamwork and desperation instead of how this movie could have otherwise gone: extremely cheesy. Infinity War is the most entertaining movie i've watched this year and one of the few movies where I sat in the theatre for over 2 hours what felt like and flash-forwarded to the end because of how EPIC and FUN this movie was. The critics have been watching so many preachy and superficial movies with amazing \"plot twists\" and \"stories that break the heart\" when in reality they are more superficial and gimmicky than anything Infinity War ever intended to do. Infinity War is about having a good time. Critically acclaimed movies these days seems to just be about spreading a message covered in a $$$ and ego-boosted package.", "Best marvel movie ever, hands down. Incredible combination of the whole marvel universe.", "I prefer DC because I grew up reading Batman, Superman, Justice League so I have a hard time understanding why they were not as popular as Marvel. I just come to realize why. Marvel is made for kids, younger adults, and then you have kids that have to taken to the movie by adults. Lots of money there. DC is darker and made for basically adults. \nAvengers: Infinity War is a good movie, but to me it is too much like a cartoon with too much CGI and too many superheros. One thing I don't understand, with the possibility of half of the people in the universe are going to die they tried to be too funny. In the end I viewed it once but have zero desire to see it again, but see it once for sure.", "Let's, for the sake of simplicity, divide it into theme-based and character-based points: 1- The movie starts out strong. Very strong, in fact, for a movie with a very important mission statement: To tie up all the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies (excluding F4 and X-Men) and deliver a fitting conclusion (or semi-conclusion?). 2- For a movie that has such a great number of heroes and heroines, the movie does a fairly good job of distributing screen time between each of them. Of course, some characters get a bigger share of screen time, but this is to be expected, of course, since those characters are the ones who have their own individual movies. 3- There are some great jokes in the movie which made me chuckle despite my best efforts not to do so, and also some misplaced ones which made me question if such a character would make such a joke in such a dire circumstance. 4- Despite the fact that the last half hour of the movie (if not more) is pure action, the dramatic elements in the movie are particularly strong and this somewhat means a deviation from the formula of Marvel's most recent movies. 5- The antagonist of the movie seems to have been crafted masterfully. The inner-workings of the character makes the villain almost \"not-a-villain\", who, in other similar movies, would only pursue a goal of domination only for the sake of it. The way Thanos's mind works is, to the best of my knowledge, in line with the comics, which makes the story even more relate-able, and the character believable. 6- The ending does deliver a huge blow to the audience (in so many aspects, if I may add so), and makes us wonder what may or will follow up after this particular block-buster. (Deadpool 2 doesn't count. Sorry.) 7- The post-credits scene is utterly meaningless, especially after such a huge ending, and does not leave us wanting. 8- Last, but not least, the music, the cgi, the multiple environments in the movie are all masterfully done, and it makes you wonder, what next? All in all, this is a movie which would deservedly get a 9/10, not just from me, but from a whole lot of people out there. Still, in my humble opinion, Winter Soldier -as a story well told- is and will always be one level above this one. However, the themes and the stories of these two tend to occupy two different places in the space-time continuum, if I were to be completely honest.", "I like Marvel Movie as popcorn film .Never was that much invested in the characters as they felt empty but after watching Infinity war i will say that it has changed my mind .I can feel these character's pain ,struggle & their hopelessness .Its a Dark Movie with perfect mix of light comedy .Have to give credit to Russo brothers that they brought real serious stuff inside Marvel ,First Winter Soldier & Now Infinity War .I m Sad seeing the Demise of my favorite characters .I wasn't ready for that  Black Panther showed the WAY & Infinity war took it to Next Level with Really Good villain who isn't evil just for the Sake of Evil .As they say Comic story is as good as their Villain .Nolan showed that with Joker & Now Russo brothers showing that with Thanos .I can't hope anything better .Suddenly i feel i m Completely satisfied with a MCU film & I don't want anything more .  i would call Infinity war as the Second Titanic of the Movies,You can't do anything better than that ,its one of a Kind .It has created its own Legend .I have now new respect for MCU that it really deserve the Fame ,Money that its earning .It care for its audience ,comic lovers ,movie lovers .Its an art which will live far beyond its time", "Best marvel movie to date! All the hype let to this you would be a fool to miss this movie", "This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat LITERALLY FROM BEGINNING TO END. It keeps bringing thrill and excitement and the intensity of each scene, but at the same still carrying an amazing plot line. Dude. This movie is INSANE.", "Thanos is coming. That's about all I can write for a plot synopsis without delving into the many potential spoilers that \"Avengers: Infinity War\" contains. Obviously, Earth's mightiest heroes will stand against him, joined by the various other characters that the MCU have introduced in the decade of success we've enjoyed since \"Iron Man\".  \"Infinity War\" is one of the rare films that, for me, lives up to the gargantuan hype that has revolved around it, since is announcement. Tonally, it's spot on. The moments of levity releasing a tension that caused by the honest belief that this is going to be the end for some of the characters we've spent that happy decade with. Somehow, despite the history with the previous 18 movies, that the heroes will win in the end, there's a sense of purveying dread throughout \"Infinity War\", that any encounter with Thanos is going to be the last time we see that character and if it's even possible to stop him, the cost is going to be astronomical.  Marvel are often accused of having a problem with their Villains, but that is not the case here. It really is Thanos' film, he's in virtually every scene and even when absent he's the focus of discussion from the other characters. It's testament to Josh Brolin and the writing and animation teams that Thanos is not simply some genocidal madman, he believes in the justification of what he's doing and the price he's had to pay to do it.  One of the initial concerns I had was how they would balance the 50 odd named characters without making them token. My concerns were unfounded - the writing team do a masterful job of explaining why each hero is where they are and their justifications for staying or travelling to where they do. It's full of little hero moments, that make your heart beat a little faster and as I say above, the comedy is spot on. Doctor Strange is much more compelling here, than he was in his solo film - the sorcerer supreme at the height of his powers, his dialogue, event he early comedy is much better written than before. The heaviest work from a hero point of view is probably done by Thor, who continues to show the character development across his films arc, and the humour that Chris Hemsworth is becoming so adept at.  The ending (No spoilers here) is perhaps the only real blot on the copybook. Despite the immediate shock of it, you realise fairly quickly that it's . . . not going to stick, I guess is the best way to describe it and that next year's Avengers film will be about sorting out the situation that they are left in. But this is a relatively minor quibble, soon routed by the realisation that we're actually only half way through an epic story of loss and redemption.  One year to wait until Avengers 4, I will be counting the days.", "Thanos was great as villain (his motives, not so much), the action scenes were good, I liked most of the character interactions, there were some emotional scenes that were done well, and a few things will transpire that you won't see coming, which was very exciting. A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Way too overcrowded with so many heroes and not enough characters development. The plot is good but it's a mess. Doctor strange was a great addition to avengers movie but not with star lord and his crews. Overall it is a forgetable movie as it has absolutley no impact for the MCU. Eveirthing they did in this movie will be undone in the next one, and that is for sure.", "That took long enough. A good movie without plot holes and more character development. Good things about the movie were the memes, visual and special effects, motion-capturing, and great storyline. I give it a very good 10/10. Nothing wrong.  Despite the loss of some beloved characters(practically at the end), we still saw a very good movie. All the characters were properly portrayed along with showing how they are continuing to evolve and fight back against Thanos. Amazing movie. 10/10.", "First, I would like to point out that this is not a bad movie but it is definitely not the greatest. Let's talk about the plot first. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who haven't watched at least 3 latest Marvel movies since I know to some people, this will be their first Marvel movie. But if you don't mind some strange confusing parts going on during the movie then I think you would be good to go. The plot was conveniently worked out. Not perfectly worked out, just conveniently. The pace overall and the fightings make the whole movie kinda overwhelming. If I have to rate the overall script, I won't know where to start. It would definitely take another watch to fully understand and make some review.\nPlot/script: 7?/10 The best thing about this movie is the visual effects. It really can be seen that Marvel took time and efforts to take this to a whole new level. Impressive and very well executed. An ultimate safe way to rescue the movie from being a fail blockbuster. \nVisual effects: 10/10 Like any Marvel movie, you cannot miss the humor. It's still the same sense of humor: \"easy to capture and straight to the punchline without minding a lot about the timing\", IW actually did a better way to execute jokes in this movie if compared to other Marvel movies. The timing make more sense and it doesn't throw people off the rails because of the jokes that much anymore. I get the reason behind this but I would give this comedy a go.\nHumor: 8/10 That's everything that I think Marvel improved after 10 years of a great franchise. Now to some stuff that I think they still need to work on it a bit more. The character development still isn't one of the main things that Marvel cares about. Especially in IW, there are still some confusing and sometimes make no sense parts. Characters have a lot of potential to make IW an even better movie but unfortunately, the extension of the movie didn't allowed. Can't blame them for this but if they could improve it in next solo movies it would be great.\nThe character designs were great, except Thanos. He looked weird, not so scary and can be improved. Of course, this is just my opinion. There are two things make this movie unenjoyable.\nFirst, the music. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't connect to the things happening on the screen. It's a mess. The score could make the movie more enjoyable or absolutely destroy the scene. And the IW score is just disappointing. The magic of the movie is gone. If it wasn't for the visual effects that save the experience, I wouldn't know how this movie would turned out since the score was poorly designed. I'm not saying the music is bad, it's the timing that's terrible. Secondly, the camera work. It got worse as the movie closers to the end. Especially at a scene of Doctor Strange and Iron Man conversation, the camera pan destroyed the mood. They could have edited that, but they didn't which is kinda disappointing. Another scene at the end, the camera just shake a lot. It like the camera man just lost control of their camera. Again, it just makes the mood of the scene disappear. Overall, I would say this movie gets a 7,5/10. I expected it to be an 8 based on what I get from the trailer. It was over average, a good generics film, a great improvement over the years of a fantastic franchise. The only things I cannot handled is the score and the camera work. Was it worth the money? Yes.\nWould you watch it the second time? Yes.", "Avengers: Infinity War is not only the 3rd Avengers film or 19th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but also marks the 10 year anniversary since the start of everything MCU with the first Iron Man film. A lot of expectations are put onto this film, this is the film that unites the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy to take down the greatest threat yet, Thanos (Josh Brolin). I will not go too much in depth with the story, only referring to what we saw in the trailers. The cast in this film is absolutely ridiculous, Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt. With such a huge cast it will be naturally difficult for the writers and directors to successfully balance all of these characters, giving them enough to do. In most cases it works, in others however I felt that more development was required. A good choice by the filmmakers was the idea to split up these characters all over the universe. They were paired up in smaller groups, this gives the opportunity to bring in some of the classic dynamics that we have come to love and also set up some new conflicts. However what was done with one relatively small group in the first Avengers is done here with multiple groups. This causes some characters to lose their strength in development that made them so interesting in their previous films. This is why I recommend to have seen some of the Marvel films beforehand, otherwise this film won't emotionally move you as you aren't familiar with most of the storylines and characters. One of my biggest worries about Infinity War was Thanos, most other villains in the MCU were boring uninteresting entities that the heroes simply had to face and punch their way out. They were never interesting and there was never a sense where the audience could understand them. Luckily Thanos breaks that tradition, Josh Brolin gives a very conflicted performance of a creature that wants balance in the universe, which is why he wants to collect the infinity stones. The audience receives a motivation, (which I will not spoil) that makes this character understandable and to a degree even relatable. You never root for Thanos but you understand him at the same time. Brolin easily gives us the best MCU villain and one of the strongest comic book villains in years, easily exceeding Tom Hiddleston and Michael B. Jordan. The same thing can unfortunately not be said about the hero characters. Some receive extra material that allows them to shine as the great actors they are, notably Robert Downey jr, who adds the typical eccentric charisma of Tony Stark but there also seems to be sense of terror and panic within his portrayal. Downey jr has now played the genius, playboy, philanthropist for 10 years, it's still awesome to see that this Academy Award nominee puts this amount of effort into a role he has now played for a decade. Zoe Saldana also has some key scenes to really shine, especially when she comes to realize who the attacker is. Gamora has never been my favorite Guardian of the Galaxy. However this is the first time where I find her character interesting. Overall Infinity War is a popcorn spectacle with a great villain and some terrific performances, however the different tones can be jarring sometimes and most other hero characters receive very little development.", "The final 30 minutes make this an absolutely stunning film. These minutes were fast paced, visually astonishing and extremely well and unpredictably written. \nStill in the beginning there was some awkward humor and also some pacing issues.\nBut I will say it is in the top 5 MARVEL films.", "The major challenge for such a huge movie- was distributing screen time among the \"protagonists\"! Marvel almost managed to make it work. All the big guys of the MCU got their screen time. Some, a bit more than the others, but it didn't disappoint! What did was the fact that not everything gearing up to Infinity War was given enough reel! I went with some unnatural expectations. I blame Thor: Ragnarok for it- that movie was a game changer- it set the bar real high! And, due to that, with the Infinity War, not all the expectations were met, really! I felt the film moved a little too fast in the first half, leaving behind some details unexplored. In an ideal world, I would have loved to prolong and detail the scenes and juice up the experience! May be (120 minutes x 2) instead of 1 150 minutes film. Pros: The obvious one!\nSome interesting fight sequences and some inspiring plot movements helped the movie hold the attention.\nFight sequences were well managed. \nRight characters were given extra screen time. justified Infinity War plot better!\nIt brought everything Marvel had been making for last 10 years together! Cons: Too many events for one movie.\nSome second grade characters were given too much of screen time.\nToo much left unexplained to leave the movie on a cliff hanger.\nSome incredibly stupid scenes on which the plot directly depended makes one feel that the plot was forcibly pushed on a direction.\nI was expecting one big wild card entry and one special emotional moment- that didn't really happen!\nLast 15 minutes were somewhat disappointing. Among other things, the fact that the film ended was heart breaking.\nThis one had only one post-credit scene, meaning, at least one more post-credits was cut out!", "This movie is not only the culmination of the MCU but answers our deepest questions. This movie is NOT an Avengers movie, but think of it more of a Thanos. Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is truly amazing, in my opinion the best villian the MCU has ever scene. You will see layers of Thanos unfold throughout this movie, even the villain has much character development. This movie has so much to it. It is hilarious, epic, heartbreaking, you will cry out laughing, screaming, cheering, and crying. The ending to this movie is amazing and unpredictable, it will leave you shaken in seat and longing for the next one. I advise everyone to go and watch this masterpiece, because you will not be disappointed. (and remember to stay for the end credit scene)", "Infinity War will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you hate the villain, it will make you understand the villain. After all you will be all over the place when it ends.\nInfinity War has the best villain, it has the best action scenes, it has laughable jokes, it has some cringe moments. It's a real masterpiece. At the end Thanos comes out glorious. But his glory crumbles with the 3 words Gamora has said at the end. \"At what cost?\"", "From the very start the movie shows that there are high stakes by getting rid of characters straightaway. It contains some great jokes and action, and at times engenders emotional depth... however when the film finishes I felt that it wasn't really a full movie, rather just another \"part 1\" with a weak cliffhanger. The risk that this movie runs is that if it revives most of it's characters in the next Avengers (which is likely) the movie becomes redundant. Still though, would recommend.", "I can't say much without ruining this film so instead I will just give a very vague overview of the movie with no plot points and no spoiling will be done. As you will probably have guessed this movie has been anticipated since 2012 when the first Avengers had hit the screen. This sort of thing had never been done before on the big screen with a group of characters. It was the turning point and issued in the Golden age of Marvel comic book movies.  Six years later we finally get to see Thanos and his search for the infinity stones. Thanos is probably the best Marvel villain since Loki and we see why he does terrible things. His reasons are actually quite justified in a sick sort of way and play on the human idea of overpopulation.  For a film with so many characters I think the story does a great job of giving screen time to all however some of the characters do things that are out of character a bit. The film does drag on a little too much and has the habit of sometimes sacrificing a good character development scene for action. \n \nSaying that, the action sequences are probably the best in a long while from any marvel movie. Because this is the serious Marvel movie as well the comedy does suffer quite a bit and I does kind of kill the scene for me when a joke is said as it is not really in keeping with the seriousness of the film.  The score is very great as well and they even threw in a new guardian of the galaxy song to announce when they are on screen. The score is pretty textbook slow piano stuff and the do use a lot of the dramatic violin which has become a bit of a clich\u00e9 at this point. Overall every technical aspect of this movie is flawless. The CGI works really well and it is everything we come to expect from a Marvel movie.  This movie feels like an ending in every sense of the word. Things transpire and characters do irreversible things. It really felt like I was watching the peak of superhero movie franchises and certainly a change in the status quo of Marvel movies. Although I enjoyed the movie very much, I couldn't help thinking \"where do we go from here?\" People have been saying for a while that superhero movies have had their day and infinity wars feels like a swan song.", "I've wished for many villains to be killed off in TV shows but never have I ever wanted a supposed \"Hero\" dead as much as I want Iron Man gone from the Marvel Universe! He's completely and utterly ruining it by hogging the spotlight and reducing other characters to his minions! At one point in this film I just thought \"Good, Finally\" then Dr Strange had to go and mess that up by going back on his own absolute statement of intent earlier in the film in order to save Tony Stark! Hulk was neutered and confined to Tony's Hulk-Buster Armour! Spiderboy is a shadow of the Amazing Spider Man and also stuck in Iron Man's Armour! Peter Quill is just plain TOXIC! We're back to Guardians 1 Starlord here unfortunately! \nNow I could go on and on BUT there's one other HUGE problem with this film and that's that there's absolutely no way Marvel are going to stick with this situation! We know there's going to be sequels to Black Panther and Spider Man so this film is one big wipeout! It will be reversed in the next Avengers Movie for certain!\n6/10 for now, I will review that grade when I've seen what they do with the series from here - and yes this is a series, it can't be rated as a one-off movie!", "A Simple Spoiler free Review before you head out to the movies. Keeping the hype real, Avengers Infinity war is a stellar portrayal of characters beautifully threaded into a narrative. The Big bad of the movie certainly stands out as one of the biggest and strongest Marvel villain so far. Even though the movie has made changes in the narrative of the villain from it's comic book counterpart, as an actor Josh Brolin delivered what he had to. Drawing parallelism with some of the greatest visionaries of all time (in fiction) such as Ozymandias and Bertrand Zobrist, Thanos believes in the balance of nature and would go any far to control his own OCD mania. Meanwhile the heroes of the universe struggle their best to push their limits so as to stop the Thanos from achieving his mission. The film is a culmination of ten years worth production under MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and goes on portraying an event, more like and end game rather than going for a normative storytelling approach as seen in other Marvel movies. The slight changes from Comic book story line is very well compensated.  As a prelude to the second part of the movie, the film has achieved it's goal while giving the audience a major cliffhanger to ponder upon. The credits scene is missing in the movie, but compensates with a classic post credits scene as Marvel keeps the hopes alive for the upcoming movies", "This movie plays very well. Good excitement, good blend of all the characters. The strongest Avengers, regarding the fight against Thanos, in their order of effectiveness, seem to be Thor, Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, Dr. Strange. Collectively, the Guardians of the Galaxy are also strong. No one else really puts a dent in him. SPOILERS********************* - several Avengers will die, but almost all have future projects in store, so you know the next Avenger movie will be all about resurrection (I mean, really, no one's killing off Spider Man and Black Panther fpor good!). Starlord's girlfriend knows the secret to killing Thanos, but she'll have to be resurrected. I'm just glad Iron Man and Capt America are still kicking to save the day. They were both seriously on the chopping block.  Can't wait for the next film. I'm just glad I got viewing this movie over with!", "Just see it, go now! One star reviews for this Film are completely ridiculous! This is the culmination of 10 years of Marvel films, everything's gradually been building towards the Infinity stones story line. Don't watch only this film and then complain there is no plot! The best parts of the film are the character interactions, it's genuinely hilarious, although overall the film is pretty dark in tone. It's no real spoiler to say that major characters do die. The standouts for me were Thor and the Guardians, so much great banter. The same can be said for Stark, Strange and Spider-Man. Most characters get enough screen time and the action is relentless, jumping from one action set piece (or World) to another without feeling too much. You will experience just about every emotion watching this film. The scenes in Wakanda was also a stand out, especially the battle! Make no mistake though, this is definitely part one of a two part film. It's going to be a very long year to find out how this story ends in Avengers 4.", "MCU does not play around.... I'm sad for the loses... but damnnn what a movie....", "I actually don't know what to say. This had some uh very big twists. It does not end how you would think with a major comic event happening. Uh my theory was right but I've told very few people so. Let's just say I laughed, I cried tears of joy, W specially when cap came in and the avengers theme played, and I cried tears of sorrow when four legitimate character deaths happened and at they very end when something big happened. Very big. Thanos was well done. He was a very menacing villain, possibly the best MCU villain and is actually relatable. A character we've longed to say again comes back. One we haven't seen in almost a decade, wink wink. The black order was ok. Wished we could have learned more about them but it's ok. A lot of the trailer content was not in the movie. However most of that should be on Blu-ray. A character is teased in the end credit scene but they troll with the usual mod credit scene which is actually not there and the \"this character/team will return\". That honestly was a mixed bag with the other viewers. Highlight was this one guy who saw the solo trailer said wait not on that the fourth when the realest date came up and multiple crying and oh man is that nova, oh it's the defenders form one dude. He was ignorant and also said there are three parts although the Russo brothers stated there are no parts. Each movie can stand alone. And there were multiple NO *cries loudly. So be weary with your audience. The cgi was rough in very few places and acting was good as always and the pairings of the hero's is notable. One being tony and strange. They were a good duo. The movie so many twists I couldn't even explain. I'd have to rewatch the movie before I can explain it. Overall with all the moments where you feel like yelling with joy, my audience as well as I sure did and very loudly on my part, and the multiple crying moments this movie probably deserves a solid 8/10 but with all the actually good things a movie needs like a solid story big surprise out of nowhere and solid pace this as of right now gets a 10/10. I'm definitely seeing this again and will probably cry myself to sleep tonight.", "Amazing! Shocking! Expect the unexpected! WHY IS GAMORA!", "Literally the greatest movie I have ever seen. Start to finish it was epic. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I seriously cannot wait to go again", "Just magnificent piece of work the director nailed it the actors nailed it everybody did a good job", "The first thing that i will say is that if you dont see this movie in the theatre you will regret it because this will go in history as one of the best movies ever made. The characters,the visuals,the action are all top notch. Thanos is the best MCU villain and probably the best comic book villain aswell. The ending of this movie alone deserves an Oscar.\nGo see it ASAP Because trust me you dont want to get spoiled.", "This is a wonderful event film which makes perfect cinema entertainment, however on reflection, and now my own hype for it has dissipated, there are quite a few questions and potential plot hole that actually bother me\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\nThe film jumps straight into the end of Thor Ragnarok and Asgaurdian ship being destroyed with nearly all the Asgaurdians being killed. But what happened to Korg? They seemed to build him up in Ragnarok and he became an instant fan favourite, so for him to just be killed off screen seems a bit disrespectful to the character and the fans.\nAlso, why would the Hulk only show up right at the end? What was he doing? I understand it was so Loki could use the line 'we have a hulk', that Tony Stark used on him in Avengers, but there is no way the Hulk would have sat out the initial attack.\nSpeaking of the hulk, why, after getting a beating from Thanos, does he refuse to 'come out' for the rest of the film? This is not who THE HULK is! \nRemember when the Hulk one punched that Jitari battle worm thing? \nMarvel clearly does not. \nHe has been getting weaker each film and this time decides to sit it out despite the fate of the universe being at stake.\nAlso during this opening scene, the ship is badly damaged and clearly exposed to space. Ebony Maw, one of the Black Order, is here, unaffected by this, just like everyone else. But later in the film, being sucked out of his spaceship kills him and you see him freeze in space. Why? Earlier he was unaffected. There has to be consistency here. Iron Mans suite is now so powerful it can pretty much do anything the writers need it to do. This was a problem for me in Black Panther, where they had the right tech for every eventuality, no matter how ridiculous it was.\nNow Iron Man has a nanotech suite that can morph into different shapes and create new weapons at will. Need a shield? No problem. Need a jet engine in place of your feet? No Problem. Need your hands to turn into giant pile drivers to punch Thanos in the face? No problem. Watching him is like watching a hyper kinetic anime with a cyborg who keeps powering up.  Two other members of the Black Order, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive, go to collect the Mind Stone from Visions head, and give Vision and Wander, supposedly two of the more powerful MCU heroes, a real beat down trying to retrieve it.\nJust as it looks like they are going to lose, Steve Rodgers turns up just in time. But it is Black Widow, who jumps in and rather easily betters Proxima in hand-to-hand combat. Now, Black Widow is just a human with some good fighting skills. Proxima is a super powered agent of Thanos, who just gave vision and wander an ass whopping. This happens again later in the film and still makes no sense. At another major point in the film, Thanos get pinned down and put to sleep by the Avengers. Spiderman and Iron man are trying to remove his infinity gauntlet whilst Drax stands around doing nothing to help. Just before they remove it, Peter Quill lets his emotions get the better of him and he smack's Thanos in the head with his gun, waking him up and then defeating the group.\nThanos could have been stopped right here! If they removed the glove, DR Strange could have sent it off somewhere he couldn't find it. But no, they stand around and either do nothing or aggravate Thanos back to consciousness. In the battle at Wakanda, the force field was shown to take the impact of a whole spacecraft landing on it. And yet for some reason, if enough aliens throw themselves at it, a few can squeeze through. \nWorried one or two may get in around the back, Black Panther opens the field letting in thousands, to try and contain them in one area. This was a really stupid plan by anyone standards as they are soon overrun. But don't worry, Thor turns up just in time now he has his hammer back after a good old side quest and can use lighting attacks again.\nOh but hang on? Wasn't the whole story Arc in Ragnarok that Thor would realise he didn't need the hammer to become the God of Thunder he was meant to be, and by the end, was far more powerful without it?\nBut here he needs it again, it's like that story was just ignored so they could add in a side quest. Also, if Thanos army had these huge digger machines that can bury under the force field, why not just use them in the first place? Come on now.", "I can not with words describe how amazing and Well done this movie was! I have been waiting for this movie for so long and i had really really big expectations. But it still blew my mind. I really was not ready for this. When the movie was over i literally felt like i was walking out from a funeral and it was both amazing and absolutely heartbreaking.  This is so big, the movie is huge and it feels amazing to be a part of all of this. Wow and dont even get me started on seeing all the characters from different movies suddenly together. I was amazing to see the energy and chemistry between them. This is definetely going to be the biggest movie of the year!", "The ending is a daring one but the post credit scene renders it all but useless as does the fact that marvel have announced their films for the next few years meaning the \"deaths\" may count for nothing at all.", "This movie is packing many aspects into its backpack and amazingly it succeeds delivering all of it.\nHow is it possible to fit massive load of heroes on screen?\nIs the directing and cutting hasty, editing messy? The answers are; Very possible and no, there isn't anything wrong with the linearity of plot and scenes. Russo bros have obviously been workshopping the content for years and it has paid off.\nPresentation works, no side jumping plot, fitting many top actors with enough dialog to keep everyone on the board with his/her favourite superhero along the ride. Movie actually is best of superhero movies that have been made till this day.", "The film was amazing lived up to the hype and exceeded it at some points! The beginning instantly impressed me and I thought it would get worse but it just didn't it was amazing throughout!", "Come on do I have to explain myself? It wasn't what I expected. But it blow my mind", "First of all, thank you for ending so much wait with this epic movie. The roller coaster of emotions, the laughs, the satire, the drama, the heroic scenes .... This is just a perfect way of how marvel actually respect their fans !!! Can't wait for the Avenger 4", "I love every scene in this movie, they are all perfectly aligned. The movie is beyond expectations and lives up to the hype.", "Lives up to the hype and then some! It has everything you could wish from a cinematic event 10 years in the making. All the characters are where we last saw them and this means we'll be taking a ride from places like Brooklyn and Wakanda to many different corners of the cosmos and it does not disappoint! The scenery is always varied and provides some of the most amazing backdrops to this universe wide adventure. The action scenes are fierce, full of emotion and pack a serious punch. As always with the Avengers movies, the character interactions are almost worth the price of admission alone! During an action sequence you are more often than not both afraid to blink, cough or chew cause you might miss something. The stakes have never been higher and this is felt throughout the movie, yet the humor has not been forgotten, it's not in the style of \"Thor Raganar\u00f6k\" if you were worried about that, but no character is suddenly grim or dark just for the sake of it, everyone acts like you'd think they would. Which brings me to Thanos.. this dude is intimidating as hell, but has a complex personality and is definitely not just evil for evil's sake! Josh Brolin does a great job bringing him to life. The rest of the cast is as good as they have ever been, or perhaps even better since many of them have had so much time in these roles already. It truly is something you want to see on the big screen, maybe more than once!", "I have never felt this way after watching a movie before. I'm at a loss for words and can only describe how I feel like I've lost a part of me but I'm not quite sure what it is. By the end of the movie, I didn't even want to talk about it. It just managed to hit me so hard that I'm still in shock. The Russo brothers were able to captivate the audience from the second it started. The balance between all the characters and their chemistry left me in total awe.", "This is a non-spoiler review. I recommend watching the film without reading any reviews, but if you insist, here we go. I'm not sure that I have ever been more excited to see a movie, despite being just a casual fan of the MCU (I've seen them all and like quite a few of them) The Winter Soldier and Iron Man being my favorites. (none of them rate above an 8/10 for me, they all fall in the 6-8 range). I stayed well away from tv-spots, interviews and early reactions, got the earliest ticket to the biggest screen in town and I am so glad that I did. This movie not only lives up to the unbelievable hype, but is also the best entry in the series to date. The first 45-50 minutes of this movie is some of the sharpest, fumiest, action-packiest entertainment i've ever witnessed, it just doesn't slow down, and right when you think it does, it whips right back into it. The first act of this movie is as good as any third act in any comic book movie, accept funnier. If you didn't come for a laugh however, fear not, the movie eventually does take a breath to cover the more weighty parts. Speaking of taking breaths, the effects in the film are outstanding, almost every scene has something that impressed me, be it an establishing shot, a Raccoon closeup or a comic-come-to-life action extravaganza. Okay so how is the action? Picture the hand to hand combat from The Winter Soldier, the airport scene from Civil War and the battle for New York from the first Avengers, now imagine that they are all happening at once. Although the latter two obviously have the biggest influence because of the scale this movie is on, there is an added element this time around, and one that has been missing for far too long: stakes. Red, juicy stakes and with an extra dose of salt. Okay but the characters, how are the characters? First of all... they are great. The insurmountable task of balancing, what, 40 A-list actors? (holy shit that's a big cast) is pulled off effortlessly by the directors. Of course there are characters that get less screen-time than i would have liked, such is the nature of the movie, Shuri in particular was a let down since i came out of Black Panther really loving that character, but hey, i understand. Thor was a standout for me, Chris Hemsworth was simply magnificent throughout, and after such a perfect portrayal in Ragnarock, somehow outdoes himself. This movie made me feel what i think a lot of people felt when watching The Avengers for the first time, personally I don't love that movie, I love bits in it, but as a whole I \"only\" like it. But every 5 minutes of this movie I felt myself smiling, laughing out load, wanting to stand up and cheer in a way that movies usually dont make me, I was hooked in every sense. For this reason I have decided to rate it, again \"only\" a 9 out of 10 (which i pretty high for me) because i simply can't yet know how much i was simply caught up in the moment. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with getting caught up in the moment, but I want to see it again to see how it plays when i know the outcome and am not constantly out of breath. Watching Age of Ultron for the second time, i didn't love it as much as I did the first time (although i still like that movie more than most) so my score right now lies between a 9 and a 10 and a second viewing will decide on which side it falls.", "Avengers Infinity War is the culmination of all the Marvel movies since phase one. The movie follows both the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy in their mission to stop the Mad Titan Thanos in his quest to gain all six of the infinity stones, which could potentially destroy the galaxy as they know it.\nInfinity War is an action packed adventure that utilises all characters to their full potential and highlights them with a detailed story. The story is not only extremely well written but is also true to both the source material and characters.  This is a very funny movie. Characters such as Tony Stark (Robert downy Jr) , Spider-man (Tom Holland), Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and Thor ( Chris Hemsworth) bring their usual well timed humour to the movie which adds a sense of lightheartedness to the movie which is needed as the tone of the movie can be a little dark at times.  The team up between the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers was seamless and added more depth to the story as well as more humour and banter between characters.  The directors of the movie (Anthony and Joe Russo) have created a movie that is not only well directed but also a movie that is also right in every way. This is one of the Marvel films where everything works. The cinematography is beautiful and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible.  One of the things that really shone consistently throughout the movie was the villain Thanos. Thanos is one of the best MCU villain to date. The Russo brothers really did a great job in developing his story and showcasing him as the villain.   As the film is constantly switching between different characters and paces the film can lack a constant tone and can suffer from a slight drag, but this won't bother most of the viewing audience.  Defiantly go to see this movie if you aren't planning to already as it is one of (if not) the best MCU movie to date. Even if you aren't partially a Marvel fan this movie is still enjoyable and worth seeing.", "If you're someone who only needs fancy cgi and lots of explosions to enjoy a movie, this is for you. If you like movies that aren't lowest-common-denominator written-by-comittee kids movies, this is not for you.", "Personally I thought it was excellent. I wasn't expecting Oscar performances or deep plot just an enjoyable action film showing just how tough Thanos really is and this doesn't disappoint. There was alot of story to cover even in over 2.5 hours of film but thought it was done very well. Can't wait for next film.", "After the debacle that was Black Panther, I was reluctant to be excited about this. Happily, I was proved wrong. Firstly, I know a lot people don't like the amount of humour in the MCU films. I personally enjoy it and the comedic moments in Infinity War are on the money. It seems a shame to waste the laughs that these actors can deliver and the jokes hit the mark. Pratt, Bautista and Hemsworth in particular are great. Secondly, I enjoyed the narrative... mostly. Yes, sometimes it's messy and unexplained. Yes, sometimes it requires a good working knowledge of the MCU and leaves you reaching into the depths of your brain to work out how bits link in to the bigger picture. But mostly it's fine and I'm ok with that. Thirdly, kudos to the visual effects team. The action sequences are stunning and keep you gripped from start to finish. Seriously, give these guys some medals and awards. One negative: some of the characters feel underused. Obviously I'm not surprised by this as there was most of Hollywood in it but I still felt some of them weren't explored as much as they could have been. Lastly, can we all take a moment to appreciate Josh Brolin? Considering his real face is never seen, he delivers the best performance out of all of them. Yeah, his character isn't brilliantly written but he gives it everything despite this.  This is a great movie, relatively speaking. It's not going to win an Oscar. It's not going to go down as a classic. But, for what it is in the grand scheme of things, it's fantastic.", "I love this movie , exciting , suspense and great!", "Avengers Infinity War: So I thought it was really good. My concerns before it came out were about the possibility that it would feel overbloated and overstuffed. For the most part the film is able to juggle its various storylines well, although not perfectly all the time and it's definitely flawed. It wasn't an absolute homerun but it wasn't nearly as messy as it could have been. The action sequences are entertaining and it does feel like there are real stakes, something which is rare for these films.  Now for the spoilers section: I think killing a character like Loki in the beginning was the right move. The Gamora arc was well handled, but it also felt like it could have been given even more meaning. The Vision arc was also well done. As for the entire final sequence where \"people at random\" were killed, it doesn't ring true. If you really want to hit home the point that some people will randomly die and some people won't, don't have all of the main, original avengers (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk) stay alive while a lot of the lesser characters and new avengers fade away. I feel like all throughout the film the stakes felt real, but once this happened they didn't because of that same problem: the obvious characters stayed alive while the lesser characters (and a few main new avengers didn't) and additionally because it's clear that they will be coming back somehow. Having seen it, I am now less sure about the risks the writers are willing to take. As for the individual characters, I loved that Thor got more screentime than Captain America. I think with Ragnarok they now know he could become one of the favorite superheroes. Hemsworth is the most adept at handling the comedy/drama balance I feel, and it's great to see him finally being used for his full potential. Tom Holland was again impressive (his final scene with Tony was so well acted). Zoe Saldana was also one of the strongest in the cast, and she will be missed.  As for characters not used as well, Peter Quill/Star Lord was dumbed down and made to be too much of comedy relief, to a point that it was out of character. Peter Parker was his complete contrast in that he was used very well and the comedy for him works, but for Quill it did not. Or maybe it's just my dislike for Chris Pratt shining through, but he's so annoying. Oh, and what does Black Widow do again? I feel like both in Civil War and here she's just... there. Here in particular, she has one of the main spots in the poster and in billing and yet she has no arc and does barely anything of note. Even Wanda/Scarlett Witch seems to have more screentime and a better arc. It just seems like the writers, after so many films, have still not figured out how to write Black Widow, and it's a shame they're underutilizing Scarlett Johansson.", "I loved this a lot, I was surprised just how much it really exceeded my expectations and for me I'd have to say it's the best Marvel movie I've seen to date, I don't know how they'll ever possibly top it or indeed how a story could move on and pick up from a world-shattering and heart-breaking event such as the one that occurs at the climax of this movie, but whatever it is I'm sure it will be just as amazing seeing just which direction the Marvel movie universe goes next after this, I'm sure the end is going to be brilliant, and I can't wait to see what the ripples and aftermath of this movie turn out to be in the Mcu. I loved how this film could just as easily make me laugh with its very well-placed tension-breaking humour as well as make me feel sad or scared for the characters, it awed me a whole lot, I was just consistently entertained by it and I was so impressed by how a film with such ceaseless action and such a vast array of characters could work as well as this does without feeling cluttered or overwhelmingly bloated, but they pulled it off big time, this movie deserves all the success and praise it's getting. I loved how beautifully it brought together and combined the stories of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy without it for a second feeling off or jarring, or anyone compromising who the were as established characters, if anything seeing characters together that I really never thought I would like Rocket Raccoon and Thor sharing such great and easy chemistry, really opened up and broadened them as characters even more. And how they brought to life and expanded upon the long-teased menace of Thanos was just incredible, instead of being a one-note villain who you just hated, they made him like a troubled almost tragic figure who's twisted vision for a better universe had cost him his soul, you really got that it broke what was left of his heart to sacrifice Gamora. They made Thanos truly epic, he got out of that chair and he brought every bit of that galactic wrath down upon our heroes, I mean you kind of knew that they were completely screwed when the Hulk gets trounced in the opening scene! The cgi looked fantastic too, he had as much presence as anyone in the cast, looking all-but completely real. I loved this, Marvel did not stumble at this critical juncture with the movie house of cards they've been stacking for this past ten years, and this one was a fantastic gem that was well worth the wait, my mind was totally blown! Just one little thing though, what the heck happened to the \"and this puts a smile on my face\" line?! Absolutely brilliant, awesome job guys!", "The trivia entry, quoted, is \"After the credits 'end crawl' come the words \"Thanos will return\" - making him the protagonist of this movie.\" Never has the IMDB so quaintly and indirectly summed up exactly what is wrong with a film. It is basically the same problem as was with Spiderman Homecoming, and when you know your butt from your ear about anything, just a few minutes of thinking about it will make the problem perfectly obvious to you, too. The problem, essentially, is that the villain, so-called, talks more sense than any of the so-called heroes put together. When workers in China have to have incredibly cruel and devious means put in their way to stop them from committing suicide. When hundreds of children in India go missing almost every day. When half of the population in the richest country on Earth regularly experiences food insecurity. These are all moments that a smart person, that is, a person who does not unquestioningly eat up every morsel of the same recipe Marvel is shovelling into theatres every year without complaint, recognises as Thanos being right. If you are new to this planet and have no idea who Marvel, Thanos, America, China, or India are, here is the freeze-dried version. Thanos is deeply saddened by the fact that he has watched multiple planets die because their dominant species, usually a very Humanoid-looking one, has overbred to the point where instead of the bonanza and excitement that the religionists promise when we all go forth and multiply, the world ends up dying in pain. So he seeks to possess the Infinity Stones, to bring a halt to worlds becoming uninhabitable due to their dominant species overpopulating them, and instead limit the species to a point where both the species and the planet can coexist. If that sounds like horriblebad to you, then congratulations, you are exactly the problem that the real Earth faces. Those of us who know that we might not have diabetes if the world was not so overpopulated (or any of the other debilitating and destructive diseases that have increased manifold as the Human population has quadrupled in less than two hundred years) can accept the reality that if we do not get a Thanos, and soon, nature and this planet is going to do as Thanos does. And if there is one thing that history as well as science can teach even the most na\u00efve idiot simpleton, it is that nature can be counted on to be a quintillion times crueller than a quintillion Thanoses put together can ever fool idiots into thinking they are. Case in point. In the last few months, a bacteria has appeared in a part of Asstralia that, whilst not urban and connected to the rest of the world, is hardly uncivilised, either. This bacteria appears as a boil inside the skin, and generally rots off the flesh in which it appears. If you are lucky, you can lose a huge chunk of fat and muscle to this bacteria. If you are not so lucky, you might have to kiss multiple limbs goodbye. I think it is ironic that a bacteria that can turn a healthy alpha into a quadruple amputee overnight, when choosing which part of the so-called First World to appear in, appears in the one that is on record as being the cruellest in the OECD to its disabled people. Thanos probably saw something like this happen on the homeworld he tells us during this film was destroyed by overpopulation. Marvel, can I offer you a suggestion concerning your next lot of films? Other than stop regurgitating the same three-act good guy meets bad guy meets ordained resolution structure, that is? Here it is. Stop demonising the people in your stories who talk sense. Overpopulation is a very real thing, and unless the Human population of the Earth stops growing, starts declining, and soon, the worst of the consequences of overpopulation are going to make flesh-rotting blisters of bacteria seem like a mild \"cold\" by comparison. Thanos is the real hero of Infinity War, and a good storyteller would know that.", "Avengers: Infinity War (2018, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo) This is a hard film to judge on its own merits with it being the conclusion of an 18 movie story arc. All the previous films good or bad had a solid story of their own with a traditional story telling format that sprinkled the connectivity and over reaching arc in towards the goal of The Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy facing Thanos. So this is the the film that concludes these sprinkles that were set in motion 10 years ago and is 100% not a film that can be watched by someone who has not seen all or at least most of the prior films. The MCU is basically a vert expensive tv show that way and also it mimics large cross over event comics which in my experience, the individual build up issues are better than the grand finale that brings everyone together and leaves little time for characters to shine as they are overstuffed. I think this is that overstuffed 'finale' but that is not to say that there is not plenty of other good and bad factors in this epic. The Russo brothers started with Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014) which showed their shortcomings in the action sequences (in particular hand to hand combat), from their they moved to Captain America: Civil War (2016) which had a better story with a more emotional finale and better but still imperfect editing and filming of combat sequences but was saved in this vein with a great action set piece in the middle (the airport scene) and a strong final and more personal battle. Two years on they have now brought us this, the third Avengers film which its action/combat scenes are 'mostly' quite bad... I really can't tell what's really happening in a lot of them. However despite being overstuffed and poorly made in some ways it is well paced with a great tone. It is not overly silly and jokey like some of the more recent Disney tentpoles (Thor: Ragnarok, The Last Jedi), instead it is more appropriately toned for the circumstances the characters find themselves with plenty of more natural humour between the more sombre moments. Another big plus is Josh Brolin as Thanos and the way the character is written. He is the only really fleshed out character in the film and he is a really great three dimensional foil who does not disappoint after such a huge build up. Another positive thing that surprised me was how the film was pretty much half Avengers and half Guardians of the Galaxy. I think James Gunn would have been a better choice as director for this film but it could have been a lot worse. In the end we have a massive film with almost every character from past films in the series that despite its technical flaws has a great last few minutes that would serve as an even more amazing exclamation mark/ full stop if we all did not realise that due to the way the economics of a successful franchise works that much of it will be undone somehow in the future.", "Spoiler: They have Thanos and are removing his glove....Quill in his infinite wisdom, punches Thanos out of frustration that he killed Gomora..... Lol for real!? Why on Earth would ANYBODY risk the lives of half the universe, just so you feel better......he didn't do anything to bring her back or get revenge, he basically slapped Thanos' cheek....since Thanos had 4 Infinity stones and Thanos also remarks to Stark \"all that, for a drop of blood.\" The characters are inconsistent, for the most part... seems that their \"power\" is amped up or dropped, depending on what the particular scene requires....Red Witch/ Thor/ Vision etc etc. Also Thor is told he IS the God of thunder and does not require the hammer but goes to great lengths to obtain a new weapon....!!?? Wait.....what now!? This movie is dumb, brain dead and a pile of hot steaming garbage. I enjoy these types of movies but this seems the norm now....Black Panther was garbage too... he doesn't deserve to be the Black Panther! He got beat...TWICE...and cheated to \"win\".", "The movie delivers overwhelmingly and worthy for every buck spent.\nA triumphant blockbuster from the MCU sure to break(ing) and set(ting) new trends & records. It is packed with an intense and intricate narrative that wastes no time building its momentum and connects all the 18 movie threads coherently while solving minor plotholes of each film, suffered individually so far.\nParticularly applaudable and respected is the writing to embed such a huge lot of characters by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely and the gripping direction by the Russo brothers in creating this massive behemoth. The blissfully orchestrated music by Alan Silvestri is what keeps you hooked unconsciously.\nMarvel has finally learnt to justify their villains through Thanos and his villainous motives. The CGI and VFX unlike previous marvel movies have all been taken to a whole new level. Such high order ingenuity and planning in film-making is rarely observed in hollywood movies these days. \nTurn your heads down and you will regret missing an alluring moment. The makers left no stone unturned. \nSadly the fate of few characters and the waiting required to watch the untitled Avengers film next year is unfortunate because of the shocking surprises. Hope Ant-Man and the Wasp & Captain Marvel give us a peek into what's coming next. 10 Years of creative efforts ultimately paid off from MCU & Kevin Fiege. James Cameron feels there is an avengers fatigue incoming, and it has been appropriately answered through this one that MCU will never take you there.\nIt is one super-hero movie that has to win many awards in the next year oscars!", "If anyone rate this movie less than an 8, probably never rated a movie above an 8 in their life. For those who rated 3 and below, probably never even seen the move yet or they watched a bootleg copy. This movie is a 10 all the way across the board. From the beginning to the end, this movie captures the moment, while seizing the day. I'm already considering going to see it again.", "Before Infinity War for me Thanos is just another genetic looking villian for me so i don't know how much this movie do the him justice but what i do know is he slowly becoming my favorite villiant of the MCU.Infinity War is depressing as hell everytime the heroes get a tiny bit of chance Thanos crush it into dust with his ultra OP weapon The Infinity Gautlet.His ideals of bringing balance to the universe is so wrong on many levels but the fact that he believe that is the only way is what make Thanos so scary and interesting.For more than 10 years the long string successful of the MCU still continue with Infinity War so let see how much they can offer us in another 10 years.(P/S.The best dark storyline of Marvel so far is still Logan btw)", "Pretty depressing that this is so popular. The only thing I'd own out of the entire franchise is the original Captain Marvel comic.\n& BTW, a pox on Disney & Marvel for making Nick Fury black, thus taking a dump on the best artist in comics history, Jim Steranko.", "So as i said it's the best that marvel ever had!\ni have been watching Marvel Since 2012\nWhen Avengers 2012 Released ,", "Really liked how they put all characters together.\nAlso liked what they did with Thanos. A great villian where you also see the soft side of. RIP stan lee! :(", "This movie was just, wow. This movie was simply amazing, I won't go into too much detail but the performances are great (especially Josh Brolin), the directing is great, the writing is great, the action is awesome, and the special effects are incredible. The best scene in the entire movie was definitely 'The Snap' scene, where Thanos wipes out half of our heroes. It left me in total shock, and that scene still gets me every time I watch it. And what a way to end an amazing film on such a cliffhanger, the villain won and the heroes lost, completely unexpected. If you haven't watched this movie yet, I 100% recommend it you to, even if you don't like superhero movies, this one is just something else.", "This movie executed the explanation of the MCU in a beautifully phenomenal way!! It contains a gripping (SLIGHTLY sporadic) storyline although certainly makes the audience feel apart of the movie, it also executes astutely to fine details the vastness of the universe portrayed through the sheer amount of characters who all have their individualised storylines. Without saying...although in this case it appears that this needs to be said; this particular movie requires a certain level of schematic knowledge in order to PROFOUNDLY enjoy helping the comprehension of key parts in the movie, unless each individual does this and undergoes the \"Phases\" then they cannot fault this movie at all.... the action and scenes may even entice them into exploring this universe. An example of a common \"fault\" is that it is \"too CGI dependant\" ... it's a freaking superhero movie?! 'Out of this world' and all that shenanigans...\nLastly it's very very intelligent how this movie took 10 years to make {it portrays how a successful end product cannot be rushed}. The subsequent movies that follow link in beautifully (such as Ant Man & the Wasp.)", "Avengers: Infinity War is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a tremendous cast. This really does break new boundaries that have never been crossed with a Marvel movie, or any superhero film for that matter. From the very first scene, we are pulled in, we are made aware that this film is bold, daring, that the stakes have been risen to the max and the circumstances are dire. It genuinely had me at the edge of my seat, the atmosphere in the theatre was phenomenal, as we reacted and shared the journey with one another, it was a film experience I will not soon forget.  The movie also deseves to be applauded for how seamlessly it manages to combine all these franchises in to the one, it never felt overstuffed somehow, I never got lost, and, what it especially deseves credit for, never felt any one of the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Doctor Strange or Spider-Man were under utilized in any way, everyone got a good amount of screen time and a solid arc.  One of the film's highlights is, without any doubt, Josh Brolin as Thanos, he completely knocks it out of the park as this intimidating, petrifying character that we know from the get go is going to put all of our favourite superheroes in jeopardy. He had me both trembling and riveted every time he is on screen, and I was amazed with the turn the Russo brothers took in actually getting us to somehow sympathise and see a little eye to eye with a character that so easily could have been presented as just a villain.  All around tremendous. Entertaining, action packed, funny at times, suspenseful at others, Avengers: Infinity War is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, it is a sight for sore eyes and it does not let down one bit.  \nThe Avengers face their biggest challenge yet as they learn of Thanos, who has his hands on the Infinity Gauntlet and will stop at nothing to collect all six Infinity stones, which would render him unstoppable.  \nBest Performance: Josh Brolin", "With action aplenty, Infinity War brings together so many story lines, so many of our childhood superheroes and delivers it in one fun-filled, often humorous, often poignant package. Before reviewing, I decided to watch the movie again, and again.......and again! Hang on, I never watch movies four times, I just couldn't help myself with this one! And now I see why Infinity War is smashing records, and up there with some of my own all time classics such as Star Wars epIV, Godfather, Titanic, Saving Private ryan, Pulp Fiction and Gone with the Wind, yes, my genre tastes vary, and this proves just how Infinity War will be a future classic.  Now. The list of great actors and actresses goes on forever, each portraying their wonderfull characters flawlessly. It's often minor characters that steel the show; just watch Pom Klementieff's 'Mantis' and you'll smile. Of course Drax is another lovable Guardian, and let's not forget the classic Downey Jr lines or Hemsworth's top-notch portrayal of Thor. Watch out for cameos from Stan Lee, Samuel Jackson, Cobie Smulders and even Keneth Branagh gets in there too! Now, you don't need to be a fan of the genre, or even totally up to date with Marvel, but background knowledge about the characters (Thor, Iron Man, Black Panther, Thanos, Vision, Dr Strange et al) and a brief understanding about what the Infinity Stones are (although this is actually briefly explained to us) will help. What I like is that there are no uneccessary pointless plot twists, no pointless profanities and no over-the-top extended action fillers such as in LOTR. Everything falls into place, it's tidy and flows remarkably well. It's an easy-to-follow family movie. My olny gripe? Everyone was well aware that this film was to see the demise of well-known and well-loved characters, but how in the (known) universe can we have lost beloved childhood superheroes forever? Really? Did we just witness the demise of major characters, (starting at the outset)?\n \nand, well,  what about that ending! Puns intended, A Marvel-ous gem of a a movie that will last for infinity.", "Infinity war's hype was huge. so much nobody thought it can live up to that. I myself was ready to be disappointed. Boy i was WRONG and i couldn't be more happy. Russo brothers nailed it. they made something seemingly impossible. putting all those heroes together without making it too crowded, and everyone of them has something to do. Action is great, acting is perfect, story is very good, CGI is impressive and Thanos is by far the best MCU villain ever created. focusing on Thanos help the movie to keep it together and preventing it from falling apart. everything spins around Thanos and his motivations and it's better this way. \nI was hooked to my chair when watching it, lots of surprise, shocking moments and perfectly directed. it deserve every penny you spend. DO NOT MISS THIS.", "This movie will blow your mind, especially if you have seen the others and you know the back stories. The action from the very first second and throughout the entire movie does not let you get bored or take a break. You simply can not stop watching it. I personally want more. Can\"t wait to see what will happen next", "I just found this movie so f good, to be honest i watch Infinity War like 8 times and every time i enjoy this film more and more. I don't know what to say about that masterpiece without spoilers. The plot is simple and good, visual, dialogues, action, acting, everything is at a high level. Ending is unpredictable and shocking. Main villain THANOS is a separate praise for the whole team who create him for this movie, he is terrifying and exciting at the same time, Just brilliant work I wait for this movie so looong, this is the whole path length of 10 years which i passed, and i'm glad to be here. I'm so exciting for Avengers 4!!!! Just enjoy it!!!", "Amazing movie that just celebrates all the movies of Marvel from 2008 Ironman", "WTH!? I hate you Thanos, but Josh Brolin did an excellent job...I am very disappointed with the ending though.... How long do we have to wait for answers?", "Avengers always packed with actions and excitement . But this infinity war broke all of the records . Its the negative role played magnificently outstanding in this story . The human side of the greatest villain of time rise question about the harsh reality and defination of war . I think the God of the war stole the avengers sparks . The story tried to explain the balance of existence and told a epic story beyond writings and visualization .", "This is my favourite movie of all time. Action,comedy, and good old comic book fights. Loved it", "This is my favorite movie ever. From the action, to combining the superheroes, to the story. This movie is amazing from beginning to end. I just would like to put this out there, only 2 people in the movie are really dead. That's Loki and Heimdall. Gamora, Vision, and everybody who turned to dust are alive. They are trapped inside the soul stone. All in all, this is the greatest movie ever made.", "Honestly what can I say? Marvel continues to nail each and every movie one after another leaving us fans speechless. This movie is Marvel at its bloody best! The most interesting thing about this movie is that everyone has a balanced role unlike some movies where one superhero dominates while the others have a blink & miss role. All the characters manage to make themselves visible and noticed and the movie was very well organized! Hats off to the director duo.", "I can't imagine that so many people would hate this one. Avengers: Infinity War is dark, emotional, and entertaining. THIS IS NOT A COMEDY!!!! Sure, there were some jokes, but that doesn't make it a comedy! The first iron man had jokes, but it wasn't a comedy either. It is obviously the biggest and the best marvel cinematic universe movie. Why can't anyone else see it that way? And about Thanos, I myself am a reader of his stories in the comics, Disney had nothing to do with him, marvel had to make him a more complex villain. There's no way Disney would allow thanos to be a one dimensional CGI villain like steppenwolf from the DC universe, they wanted to humanize Thanos to be a more sympathetic and honorable character, he makes hard choices like we do, he makes sacrifices like we do. I have Infinity War twice in different cinemas, the more you rewatch it the more you appreciate Thanos, I know that I should've written a review last month a few days after watching it but like people say better late than never. Before you call this review 'unhelpful' I just want you to know, the Russo brothers did an excellent job in making such a great film like this, don't trust those reviews that say this film is for kids, it's not, it's for teenagers, young adults, and adults. And don't be such a critic to the ending hopefully those people who disintegrated after the snap will be brought back to life, because they still have some upcoming movies of their own. My rating 9.3/10", "Was it worth the hype ? Yesss . This movie hit all the notes perfectly with some jaw dropping action scenes and wonderful acting. Beautifully directed movie by the Russo brothers. Each and every scene had a meaning to the movie and doesn't let you get bored . I have seen this movie twice and i liked it more the second time. Ending was .... interesting and gets you hyped for the next movie. Looking forward to the next one. Yes , this movie is definitely worth your time !", "This movie is amazing, they incorporate the Thanos storyline (which is amazing). They also made the biggest crossover ever, and they made a trilogy good. I loved it,\nI hope you do too if you can watch this. This is definitely worth your money.", "When I first walked into the theatre I was already so excited...during the first 5 minuets of the film and had a wirl of emotions. The movie had such great everything! The music,special effects, acting and twists. I even clapped at one part! The movie is excellent and you should consider watching it because it's very enjoyable, and even if you don't necessarily like the movie then still appreciate the directors for working with so many of these iconic hero's and squishy all of them into this film and having to handle this massive movie....so congrats to you Marvel and the Russo brothers you made a filming masterpiece in my eyes and hope you all see that too.", "This movie took me to hell and back and then back to hell multiple times with every scene. There were so many emotional scenes mixed in with comedy and felt like such a good mix of the two with drama and multiple jokes thrown in. If you have been attached to these characters since the beginning then you can't expect to feel a piece of yourself die at the ending scenes, even the post-credits didn't leave out the sadness. The film had its problems of course, like the fact Doctor Strange could have easily just portaled the gauntlet off. Overall, the movie was entirely excellent and I even went to see it three times at the theatre.", "Look, the movie was really really good. I had fun watching it and it probably is one of the best MCU movies. HOWEVER. Can we consider Avengers 3 one of the greatest movie of all time ? Specially when it is just the first part of the thanos storyline !", "Avengers Infinity War is bigger and better then any other movie.", "I am a HUGE Marvel nerd and was excited for this movie. I didn't expect it to be good, but it was WAY BETTER than I had expected.", "Excellent & Great Cinematic Experience, Everybody Delivered at their Best.", "It was a great movie not one scene was boring and star to end was a suspense movie", "The Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest entry is its biggest, most ambitious piece of storytelling in the studio's 10 years of existence and the minute you exit the theatre, you'll be lining up at the box office to buy another ticket. It's that good.\nRoaring through 160 minutes of action, humor, character development, epic evil and moving nobility, it is darker and edgier, yet lighter and more stirring than anything offered in another superhero franchise.", "The beginning hits everyone, a major death and the last appearance of the Hulk in green. So many death two of the major caracters died and many civil. The new Iron man armor appeared just like that. Doctor Strange should have appear with other Avengers hero before. I'd like to see more about the infinity stone. The new Captain look is awesome. The end was definit when Strange gave up the time stone. Half of the univers died. Captain Marvel is set to appear in Avengers 4.", "Amazing action. Slightly weak plot, but they made up for it with the progression. Can't wait for the next movie!", "Infinity war exceeds all expectations! You need to see it ASAP.", "I have kind of thought that the MCU movies were falling into this formula after seeing black panther but this movie nailed it! This is what I wanted and was craving, stakes! Actual stakes! Characters \"dying\" and maybe not all of them will come back because if they did then this movie will mean nothing! As of now, this is the best MCU movie, but if they bring back every character that \"died\" then this movie would become just another MCU film, good but not insane", "Good things: For all the people out there reading this to determine whether they should go and see this movie, you should definitely go see it. This movie was amazing in many ways, especially the comedy. It seems that recently Marvel movies have gone in a different direction, towards comedy instead of seriousness like DC, which has made the recent movies so much better. This movie is great from beginning to finish, the comedy is great, the action scenes are pretty good, and there are many plot twists throughout the movie that make it so much better. SPOILERS NEXT: This movie has one of the best and saddest endings in cinema history. Marvel actually stuck to the script and killed off many beloved heroes, the only heroes that survived Thanos's snap of his fingers was; the original avengers, and Rocket. Another thing is this movie had a really good villain, Thanos. Thanos was a good villain, because his intentions may be good to some people, which was to wipe out half of the universe, so everyone on each planet could have better lives with not as many people living there anymore. And one last thing, the reappearance of Red Skull made this film so much better, and was one of the plot twists I was talking about.  Bad things: With all the good things, there had to be some bad things as well, and there were. One bad thing in this movie was what they did with the Hulk. What they did with the Hulk was they made him such a coward after the first scene in the movie, they made it so Bruce constantly tried to get the Hulk out, but couldn't. Another thing this movie did wrong were the fight scenes. In almost every fight scene in this movie, the heroes would ambush the villains and not truly beat them fairly, as the villains weren't expecting the attacks by the heroes, which made the fight scenes a little bit worse than they could have been. Ignore the haters: Everyone who rates this movie a 1* has either never seen this movie and just likes to ruin movies, or have 0 taste in movies. This movie was amazing, and i would give it a 92%, and a definite watch for everyone.", "It was a hell of a ride! No word needed...simply amazing! So good characters development. So many emotions, so much fun, so much energy, so much tears...ending was just like woe, breathless and emotional. So many characters but each one of them was great presented! After 10 years everithing came together, on the other hand fell apart...so much depth in this story! Congrats MARVEL!\nI am with you till the end of the line!!!!", "Consistence,logical and action .3 words to describe the most successful Marvel Universe movie", "Even though I was not thoroughly familiar with all of the Marvel characters, ex.Dr.Strange,Guardians of the Galaxy,I really enjoyed watching this action packed, masterfully graphic movie!! It was a thrill ride and I caught on quickly too the characters unfamiliar to me. It left me shook the opening scene and finale. In short, Vibranium for everyone!!! Anxiously awaiting part 2", "Call it a secret recipe for great film making, marvel keeps getting better and better!!", "For the last month Avengers Infinty war has been a huge discussion at school, everyone was displaying their admiration to this film as if it was life changing. After being hyped up to such an extreme amount I finally went out to see the film in my local cinema. I admit I was having a lot of fun with the first 30 minutes, full of action and witty dialogue although the film wasn't able to carry on with the immense fun which is to be expected after almost 20 movies of buildup. The second the guardians met Thor the movie fully halted and I became very bored. The entire time I was wondering about the more interesting plot of spider man, Dr strange and Iron Man but that was put to the side for countless jokes that missed and only a few that I actually found funny. After this though the film did pick up a lot of pace allowing this review to not be negative, I really enjoyed the breathtaking fight scene on Wakanda. Finally the ending of this film was such a cop-out, there is next to no chance that the characters taken away will not come back within the next movie. In conclusion this is definitely a film you should see even just for the one fight scene at the end, but the whole movie entirely became an extreme victim of hype. Don't expect the impossible.", "As a huge MCU fan I had little expectations for this movie because of all the bad reviews, but the movie blew my mind. Thanos is by far my favorite villain for all movies. I feel like there might be a lot of hate coming from fans of other movies, but everyone needs to see this movie somehow someway. It is incredible. I don't want to ruin anything, but many people are saying there is no plot. These people obviously don't know what a plot is, bc the plot is clear as day, and it is to prevent thanos from getting the infinity stones and ultimately defeating him.", "The most ambitious crossover in history of filmmaking was well executed. Characters were perfect and the plot was well developed.", "Similar to Star Wars : The Last Jedi, Avengers : Infinity War is, IMHO, vastly over rated at the current 8.8. In terms of mindless actions and visual/sound effects its first rate, but on almost every other aspects as a movie its just terrible, and I will not repeat as a lot of the recent reviews here have covered these. What I really want to say is it seems to be a trend for Disney to kill the main heroes in a franchise (Luke Skywalker and the various heroes here) just to \"surprise\" the audience and as a means to draw them back to the squeal to see whether they will be revived. This is a cheap trick. If the movie is good enough you don't cheap tricks to boost box office. The other things is, call me old fashioned, but a fantasy movie should make us happy. The heroes should always win at the end. I mean, if I need to see an invincible villain in action all I need is to watch political leaders on CNN!", "Apparently Thanos has accepted the Leftist myth that available resources are dwindling at such a rate as to be a threat to life. So his solution is to wipe out half the population of the universe. He obviously doesn't have a moral center and is not that far removed from modern liberals' advocacy of extreme measures to promote zero population growth. Personally I didn't care for the story. I like movies that have a happy ending. I go to movies to be entertained, not depressed. I want to leave the theater feeling as good or better than I went in. This movie accomplished none of those personal desires. I went, hoping for better, but was seriously let down. The movie was overstuffed with principal characters from previous Marvel's films (except for Coulson) and as a result the villain took center stage, just as the Joker upstaged Batman in Dark Knight . Moreover, the story wasn't all that interesting to me: \"battle the bad guy (with sound and visual effects) and lose.\" There was no character development or situations that could have some relevance to our lives. The superheroes functioned within the scope of their powers much like puppets on a stage. There were few humorous moments, but they couldn't save the film from its stupid plot. It was clear to me as I endured the two and a half hours that the only reason Marvel Studios didn't resolve the Thanos threat in this movie is to ensure a bigger payday. Presumably the bad day for the universe will be remedied by the next Avengers movie. By then I doubt I'll care. I'm ready to move on.", "There, I said it. This is arguably the best Marvel movie to date. In objective terms. It is the 19th movie from the MCU and a true masterpiece. When I've first seen the trailer I got hyped just like everybody else. The trailer was just that good. Credit, where credit's due. But this; it's even better than I expected it to be. The thing that resonated with me the most was the constant tension in the movie. Right from the start you get this uneasy feeling that things are about to go horribly wrong as Thanos and his henchmen confront some of the Avengers in the first act of the movie. We as the viewers are immediately getting a taste of how powerful Thanos really is. The aforementioned heroes serve as a subjective metric in this scenario. We don't need to know how they got there or what exactly preceded that event. All we need to know is that the earth and its inhabitants are in grave danger, and this is the message that the first act communicates clearly. It's masterfully executed, no fluff, it just goes straight into the action.  Unlike in previous Marvel movies this time the threat is nominal and also directed towards the heroes and not just mankind. I don't know if you noticed but up until this point the Marvel movies followed, more or less the following pattern: villain emerges, threatens mankind, superheroes feel the urge to intervene, final showdown, happy ending. This time however the tables are turned. Because unlike in the other movies the heroes have no choice but to fight for their lives. So naturally, the movie assumes a much more serious tone. This is a literal life or death situation. In the previous movies the superheroes didn't really have to intervene, no matter how big the threat was. With the sole exception of Ultron of course, but once you realize that he was created by the superheroes it's nothing but \"damage control\". To conclude: the stakes have never been higher. This is the final showdown we've all waited for. All the other 18 movies that preceded this one come full circle as the pieces fall into place. Some people have voiced complaints, claiming that the movie is just an endless deluge of fighting scenes. But that's not quite right. Yes, there are a lot of fighting scenes but this is not the main focus of this movie. It's more of a philosophical inquiry. A somewhat interesting meditation on nihilism as a whole. Yes, Thanos is pretty much the embodiment of nihilistic thoughts, whether he realizes it or not. I mean, what could be more nihilistic than to enact a genocide on a cosmic scale? Not much. With that being said this movie could easily be interpreted as an ingenious metaphor for the current state of affairs. Nihilism is on the rise among younger demographics and it is becoming a really big problem. It's a cultural phenomenon that's slowly eating away at the foundations that helped necessitate our modern society. I don't know if this is what the writers had in mind when they wrote the script but that's how I interpret it.  There is one thing that irked me a little about the movie, though. Thanos' motivation was never really touched upon in the movie. \nWithout a tangible motive his actions seemed a little far fetched, you see. But then again, I can't exactly criticize this movie too much for this lack of information since it's a two-part movie. I mean, I know what happened in the comics but this is the MCU after all, so chances are they're going to come up with a clever take on the original story. (I hope) I have no idea if the sequel is going to be equally as good. That is, of course, what I'm ultimately rooting for but the realist in me is like \"how the heck are they going to top that?\" I have no idea. Closing remarks: The Hulk seemed rather wimpy in this movie. I mean, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.", "I sobbed all the way through but it's a wonderful film and I think it was brilliant seeing all my favourites characters come together.", "Well first I want to clear one single thing. I AM THE BIGGEST MCU FAN IN PLANET EARTH. This movie isn't as good as winter soldier or civil war but you will have a blast. This movie was directed by the Russo brothers so that means good movie Then Josh Brolin performance as Thanos is in same level of ledgers joker. The confirmed deaths are:\n-Gamora\n-Loki\n-Heimdall\nAnd we don't know what in the actual ass happened to the others  I loved the ending so original", "Finally Marvel is delivering a real super-hero movie that doesn't look like a Disney fairy-tale. And what a movie. From the first second to the last, you get into the story and the action. It would have been complicated to handle so many scenes and such a big cast, but it's been done brilliantly around a solid story-line. I want to go watch it again!", "They made the biggest marvel cross over, and made it well. it had the right balance of suspense, action, humor, and emotional (especially the spider-man and iron man scene).", "Avoiding spoilers, this film is a thrill ride. Its well paced, with good back story to Thanos as we learn who he is, and why he is who he wants to be. Some absolutely more than epic funny moments as all the heroes we have grown up with over the years meet and team up with each other to beat Thanos. I can't think of a single thing wrong with this movie. The ending has been hot topics since it released into cinema however, I enjoyed the ending. Its surprisingly takes a dark turn and ends in an odd way. However this part 1, and part 2 will be shortly following next year.  But in my opinion so far its one of the best Marvel Films I have seen since Iron Man. It was done very very well, and the film did not feel overwhelmed with all its heroes.", "----------------------------------------------------------------> Milleniumlogan", "I've seen a lot of great movies, some even recently, but Avengers: Infinity War gave me this feeling that no movie has been able to accomplish. I was constantly thrilled by the action and on the edge of my seat through every exciting outcome. When I had left the theatre, my friend had said that I had cried like I had lost a family member. The characters I grew up with, the character who I've seen develop through the years and to see their emotions and their reactions. It's fascinating and heartbreaking. This movie grabbed my attention the moment it started and didn't lose any focus. I'd recommend the MCU to anyone just to have them watch this movie. Congrats to the Russo brothers for making such a breath-taking experience! I can't wait for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4!", "This movie, easily exceeds expectations. I never read any comics and fairly like SuperHero movies. I did not like Black Panther much, I still believe that Black Panther is over hyped. \nBut\nInfinity war did that magic. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I was blown away by the emotions it ran through me. It might be a little fast paced for some people. Action sequels were amazing. Villain was great. This is exactly the movie, what all 10 years of Marvel Movies deserved. This is the only movie, which I am strongly considering to go back into cinema and watch again. Definitely, worth the hype.", "Of all Marvel films, this is the one where I really expected them to drop the ball. There seems to simply be too many main characters in the universe to make a coherent and satisfying film out of, however I would say they accomplished it. Not a moment is wasted, but the film doesn't feel like it's rushing all the same. It feels like just enough time is given for each scene to develop each character, and though more could have been done and perhaps 3 hours or more would be more appropriate, it's a very clean and satisfying film that defies expectations. Perhaps the second part will fill out what remains to be explored, and that would bring it to a more reasonable 5 hours, and this film was more just half a story anyways. This is one of the most dramatic Marvel films to date with the typical humor toned down a bit as to not interfere with the darker aspects, which surely sets it above Doctor Strange in terms of consistency, though the Guardians of the Galaxy are as goofy as ever, which is also neat since all the characters still feel as they did in previous films, which could have easily been muddled with how many directors have brought this universe to this point. Thanos is probably my favorite MCU villain to date, as he has strong, logical motivations, which is admittedly uncommon among most superhero villains. Though he is definitively a villain, one can see things from his perspective, and can sympathize with him. He may be a bad guy, but his ideologies are not contrived but rather fleshed out in a believable way and shown clearly. It's quite interesting to me how Marvel has now seemed to shift to having the superior villains as opposed to DC. One of the worst things about this film is actually the trailer, which spoils the climax of the film. This isn't the first time either. Civil War's trailer spoiled two critical plot points in the film, which can be a huge problem when it takes all of the tension out of a scene since you've seen the outcome before the movie even started. I'd strongly recommend this film, though I'd highly recommend watching as many of the previous films as possible to make this film a bit more consumable. It is a bit dizzying, but that's surely not a deal-breaker given that it's so competently executed.", "Is incredible how the entire people involved in this teamed up to deliver this outstanding production. From the script to the final edit, everything is very consistent. Only the special effects have some lacks of craft and details, but overall is the ultimate Marvel production.", "Movie seems good and entertaining at first, but when you think about it(and you will, as the movie is gonna make atleast a considerable impact upon you), it seems to be at many places, illogical.  Take for instance, Thanos anticipation for Gonora at Knowhere. There is no logical explanation for that. There is no way he could have known. Also, the writers did the idiotic mistake of doing the fight scene between Thanos and Iron Man, Dr. Strange and others, after Thanos had 4 stones(especially the Soul Stone) with him. With this power, he could kill all the Avengers in a click by trapping their souls with the power of Soul Stone or alter reality to his advantage. None of these powers is shown to be used, which makes this movie seemingly go into the category of mindless entertainers! Even if it was shown that somehow the team prevented Thanos from using his gauntlet, it would have been acceptable.\nAnd then, Wanda is shown to stop Thanos for some time. Thanos take too much time defeating all the Avengers on Earth; he could have done all that in a second. All this begs this simple question: Is there really any difference between mindless Bollywood action flicks and these kind of movies? In Bollywood movies, logic and common sense is compromised/sacrificed for the sake of entertainment. Same thing is seemingly happening in this movie.\nThere is no sense of maintaining consistency and integrity between all that which is told/described in MCU. People become extremely powerful or powerless depending upon the writer's whim which is based upon the entertainment value of the movie/scenes. It seems the makers don't want to tell and create an authentic story, rather just what sells. As MCU is getting bigger and bigger, what I've described above, is happening more and more, and frankly it's spoiling the mood and fun. Not all MCU movies(especially the ones at the start) are like this. This is a recent phenomenon; a fallout or side-effect of MCU becoming more and more complex and full of increasing number of characters and storylines. This shows the writer's inability to handle the complexity and also how much pressure they have with regards to delivering an entertaining(but not authentic and genuine) story. If this is not stopped, it may sound the death knell for the MCU.", "By the title, yes, Thanos really got me. Is it Lucas who did the CGI? Thumbs up. I see living eyes, gesture and tears that a breakthrough of supervillain ever. The way he walked out from the hut to see the morning sun after his well-done wiping out half of the universe, wow! It shocked me and makes me worried of what's next, what if the scriptwriter turns everything upside down, split the spectators in two, one of course pro the good guys as always, the other starts understanding and giving emphaty for Thanos. MCU nowadays, whoever the director is, opens my eyes so wide for the incredible cinematic, and laughing out loud. They keep joking around. But beware, the main idea has to be the most of all, no excuse for slipping plot. Ah, forget it, they know what they're doing so far. Now, I say about things that I mind are, I don't like how Thor gets his right eye back that sudden, needs longer story, longer minutes, to dramatized it a bit. Remember how tough when he lost it. \nI don't like either about the super-multi superheroes gadget inventor industry a.k.a. Wakanda. Indeed few things about superheroes movies are like a glass of cold lemonade in the middle of heated up day that have us to just drink it without knowing how it was made. But when it tastes weird, I believe I would experience digest problem. Captain America should not just get his new shield, needs more scenes. Well, maybe there were those more scenes, they have to cut it off, to leave a 2hrs and 40mins war scenes.", "I was expecting more and it turned out bad and annoying so much jokes i was like it is the end of the world guys not a stand-up comedy but at least i enjoyed Thanos character.", "This is a very good film (brilliant in places) but bloated - just far, far too long. And it feels like the MCEU is nearing the end with its visibly aging stars.", "Let's be honest. You will all go and you should go see the movie. But, we have to admit that for Marvel, its very disappointing. Too far unnecessary battles, some heroes were useless and unnecessary and ''klise'', like girl doesn't kill one 'man' compared to half a universe, Thor's axe from wood, unexplained scenes, divided teams and too many scenes with useless information. CGI and Thanos was great. Most of the heroes like Dr Strange, Iron Man, Thor, Spider man were great. Others weren't. Let's hope the second part will be better.", "Superbly written and wonderfully executed. The film delivers from beginning to end. Some CGI is weak but not for the main character Thanos. They accomplish him to the screen in a perfect fashion. The film is 3 movies in one. They squeezed an entire trilogy worth of action, emotion, suspense, and excitement into a single film. The movie is 2hr and 40 minutes in length so plan your bladder accordingly. No handicap patrons had attended the show so after a few minutes into the film, I moved from the very side of the theater to the center of our row where wheelchairs would sit for better seating for my son to see. This led to us being in the walkway for anyone that needed to leave. Every person that had to leave to use the bathroom was literally running to not miss one more second than they needed to of this phenomenal film. I love Marvel (Disney) but have never enjoyed a movie enough to go back, spend money again, and watch it a second time in theater, until now. Consider Infinity War, Maximus Decimus Meridius because you will surely be entertained.", "Absolutely loved everything about this movie. I've been huge fan of the MCU since the very beginning so I was so hyped and had high expectations. It definitely exceeded them and I couldn't be happier. It was amazing.", "Definitely one for the books! Can't find a fault.  We all know there is going to be a next one. It's only fair that the story be told in detail as mich as possible.  The way Thanos was portrayed was spot on.  Just the right amount of funny and emotions. Even with all the hype, it didn't disappoint.", "What a great movie I ever seen till this time ! Marvel has already create a greate movies with good characteristic from all the heroes.", "I loved this film!!!! 10 years down the line, plenty of great films, and a few duds have led to this moment, and this film doesn't disappoint at all - well done to the Russo brothers for another great marvel film.  Despite the huge cast the film does a good job of balancing the story between all the heroes, though more Cap and black Widow would've been nice, aswell as being able to give plenty of screen time to Thanos in order to flesh him out, which is done brilliantly so we learn more about him and his motives behind his actions, which are not just a random \"Wants to destroy the world\" plot. He may actually be a better villain than Loki (Controversial?). The interactions between the different factions within the films are fantastic and are in keeping with the marvel-ous (Couldn't resist that one) sense of humour that runs throughout the MCU. I wondered whether every single previous screenwriter had been involved with how their characters would interact as none of them seemed to act out of character to their previous films, unlike for example Ragnarok, where I found Thor to be \"written\" completely out of character to the previous films, but here he is back to best. His interactions with the guardians at the start is by far my favourite exchange in the whole movie. The film is truly packed with fun, sadness, action, and quite a few shocks, which despite the spoiler warning, I will not spoil everything for you all.  However - I guess \"spoiler warning\" for the rest of the review... Obviously despite my 10 rating there are elements that could've been better in my opinion and a couple of plot holes. For example Vision explains they need to destroy the mind stone, but why didn't doctor Strange think to destroy the time stone, then there would be no way for Thanos to get them all? I felt sorry for Vision in this film as, anyone who knows anything about Marvel will know that he was going to die in this film, and I felt he has been quite underused in previous films so can't see him coming back, so it would've been nice to have seen him go out in a blaze of glory, saving Wanda for example, instead of being injured through the whole movie and not doing much else. A sorry end for a quite interesting character.  I also felt a little letdown by the Black order, I can see why Thanos only loved Gamora as his other \"Children\" were pretty poor, with the exception of Ebony Maw who I was sorry to see go. I expected a lot more from them, I especially expected some to survive this film. I loved the ending of the film as it was true to the comics although I felt the choice of characters to \"kill\" off were a little strange as all the original Avengers remained alive, whilst the \"second generation\" all disappeared, Black Panther, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, all the guardians barring Rocket - all gone, despite already having announced sequels, so obviously you know they're coming back. I think it would've been interesting if for example Black Widow, War Machine or even Bruce Banner would've gone as there would've been more of an impact. But that's just my opinion on it. I also thought Starlord would've been kept around to atone for his mistake which led to it all.", "Fabulous, emotional, shocking i like it so much one of the bests movies in the world ever", "A masterpiece 10/10, A ++ and Second time in the Cinema.\nWriters break the narrative into several branches, which develop in parallel, so the lack of dynamics is not felt from the word in general. At the same time, four to six story arches can occur and in an unprepared spectator the head can naturally go around. All the meaningful scenes after the credits of the films released over the last ten years that moved the meta-story of Marvel, are suddenly gaining meaning and developing exactly as if everyone has already been aware of what is happening. This forms a rather high entry threshold, to which many viewers, especially those who do not follow kinomics, will simply not be ready. But even without preparation the film looks great. Yes - you will not be aware of 80% of the dialogues, but you will be provided with the most powerful spectacle. A separate pleasure from viewing is the interaction of previously unseen characters. Joint scenes and mutual skirmishes are set up carefully and thoroughly. The reverse side of the coin is regular pianos in the bushes. Even not so - the film is a whole forest of bush, in which a whole train crashed, carrying pianos. Almost every scene is discharged by the unexpected appearance of another pack of familiar heroes. But otherwise it simply can not be - \"War of Infinity\" is that level of entertainment and royalty, to which Marvel went for almost 10 years. It is they who can afford it here, in the end! Let DC continue to cram unintuited into one film - we have the \"War of Infinity\" as the quintessence of the meta-scale of the world scale.\nRousseau's brothers as directors have collected in one film the whole army of actors who flaunt their characters and mingle in the unknown - the film makes high demands on the knowledge of its kirovosesa and not everyone will be happy about it. Outside observers are generally at risk of missing the lion's share of pleasure simply because they are not aware of internal conflicts and the past. On the one hand, I want to squeal with delight, when the characters of different films are on the same frame and act together. But on the other hand, it is physically difficult to perceive them all - each character has a different story, and intertwining together, they form such an ornate combination that it's incredibly difficult to keep track of all the intricacies of thoughts. Each actor is given very little screen time, during which it is necessary to play drama, and a couple of jokes to soak. But we must pay tribute - the actors sincerely tries and does not give reason to doubt the sincerity of what is happening. Therefore, it is simply impossible to single out someone specifically in this. Key characters can still boast a good screen time and an abundance of skimpy dialogues, but for the rest it goes for a second.\nSurprisingly, the main enemy of the heroes is not Thanos, but the ticking clock. The film has a lot of moments and scenes in which the characters have too much to say to each other, but they do not have enough time for it. Magnificent Movie 10 of 10. #MASTERPIECE!", "This film may not be an oscar contender or even that good but it was a historical event that will be remembered by generations after generations  So let's get into it The biggest and most anticipated blockbuster film is finally here and I saw it two days ago on 28th. How well does it hold up? First I want to give my thoughts on my initial experience. The audience was amazing, they were already familiar with the characters, which really added to the experience as the crowd popped on some pretty applaud worthy moments, which are present in an overwhelming amount in this movie. That being said, this was a roller coaster of emotions too. So many moments that made us laugh, gasp and hold our breathe. We were on the edge of our seats. I mean, this was not a film, this was a SAGA, a big EVENT that I am very proud to witness in my life time. This may be the most fun I've ever had in the theater. Now that I've gotten my initial thoughts out of the way, let's dissect the movie and go under the surface This film has sort of a negative which usually wouldn't work for a film that stands on it's own. It doesn't take time to set up or make you care about all the core characters which is a bit problematic for anyone who is seeing this movie and isn't familiar with previous installments. I have been following MCU since the start so thankfully I was fine. But this negative sort of turns into a positive for this movie because the film didn't need to set the characters up. Instead they were able to go one action scene to another, and they were able to go the pay offs a bit more quickly than they otherwise would in a standalone film. However important scene after another can be a bit exhausting and considering the runtime of this movie, some may feel exhausted AFTER watching it because this movie has so much you need to take in and process. The writing is fine. There are convenient plot devices and plot point you would expect from it and how things go from A and B but don't underestimate this movie because it does have surprises and twists you may not see coming. Some of the characters they focus on have a really good arc, I'm not gonna spoil which characters. But one character I would talk about without spoiling is the antagonist Thanos. Wow, he was done right. I mean, he had a reasonable goal and you could see where he was coming from and why he was doing what he was doing. He was imposing, threatening. You could feel the threat he posed right from early on. He brought a sense of hopelessness that is usually missing from MCU. He is a good addition to the list of good MCU villains such as Killmonger, Zemo and etc.  Character interactions between some of our heroes were really good. All these years we were wondering how certain characters would interact with others and the film does not disappoint. Interactions, whichever ones happened, were so satisfying. The film also balances humor really well. Yeah there's a little bit of forced humor but most of it is on point. Especially Drax, who is one of the funniest characters of MCU. Comedy scenes with Guardians are awesome as always. The visuals. This movie is an eye candy lover's wet dream. WOW. Everybody and everything looks great. Especially Thanos. The CGI on him is done very well. Except one member of Black Order, all others look good. The costumes of heroes, especially Spider Man looks AMAZING. This movie will give you one nerd gasm after another because of how good it looks and FEELS. The performances were really good. All actors got their moment to shine, especially Josh brolin. He was the biggest surprise as Thanos. He did so well. I applaud his performance. I did not expect him to be as good as he was in the role. The scope and scale of this film is something I really appreciated. Unlike many other MCU films, the stakes felt real and the world felt lived in and real and you could sense the danger and worry about it. You could feel the consequences of actions of characters. This was a very tense film. And very dark too. I did not expect this to be THIS dark, which works really well in this film's favor. This movie BRINGS THE WAR. I mean if you were disappointed that Civil War wasn't extreme enough( i don't think so though, I love Civil War) , Infinity War was BRUTAL and HARD HITTING, you will not be disappointed. There is a very good and intriguing set up for the future of MCU. I mean this one will leave you salivating for more and wondering what happens next. I mean, Marvel Studios has my money for next movie, I will be there to see it next year. And yes, to all those who leave before post credits, don't! THERE IS ONE IMPORTANT POST CREDIT SCENE YOU HAVE TO SEE. It's mind blowing what MCU has done here. Especially Russo brothers with this film, this was a difficult job but they nailed it. This is a dream come true for anyone who has been reading comics since they were little and at times when superhero films weren't a thing. I am not one of them, I was a marvel fan when I was little but I didn't read any comics. But I have been following MCU since the start and I'm so grateful because they are still doing a good job of keeping us invested in this universe and showing us why we still give a damn about some of the characters. Certain scenes made me teary eyed with happiness knowing I'm part of the audience who has been following this thing for 10 YEARS! This is something i can't wait to tell my grand kids or kids of later generations :')  Congrats to Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, and all the directors, writers, producers and people who worked in MCU and made it happen. They have done a brilliant job of creating such a cohesive, consistent and expansive universe. I salute them.  Rating 7.8/10  It came close to an 8 which is what I gave Avengers 1. I highly recommend this movie. especially if you are a fan of MCU but even if you're not, you won't be disappointed. In fact, you will be overwhelmed by how good it is.", "Avengers: Infinity War: Great opening sequence with Thanos and his children/minions attacking The Asgardian starship. Loki stays on the Light Side and tries to kill Thanos but is apparently slain himself. Thor is battered and bewildered while the Hulk escapes to Earth and arrives as Banner crashing into Dr Strange's HQ.. Strange rounds up Ironman as the minions of Thanos arrive on Earth. Banner Can't change back into The Hulk, only succeeding in getting green around the gills.The guardians of the Galaxy rescue Thor who then heads off with Rocket and Gruit. Space battle scenes, a Giant Dwarf forging a battleaxe.for Thor, ground battles in Africa, the Creation Myth for Gamora.. Vision and Scarlet Witch are outside a takeaway which serves deep fried kebabs when they are attacked by the children Of Thanos, possibly saving them from an even worse fate. We even get to see how Thanos got his start. Crackling dialogue, wisecracking from Ironman and smartaleckery by rocket are counterposed to Thor's solipsistic godliness. The Guardians are successfully assimilated into the Avengers storyline as is Dr Strange. Maybe a confusion of characters at times but great fun. 8/10.", "When you think of Marvel World, the whole world is fighting here. When you look at the film, yes, it is all fighting. The evil side even has more than 1 bad guy. One thing you have to say about Marvel versus DC though, the bad ones in the DC world have bigger egos that the Marvel ones. This can only mean 1 thing, the heros with the bigger egos squash the bigger ego bad guys at the box office. It's true here again. The Universe is a big place and a large portion of it is brought into the war this time. All in all, it's a great show. There are contributions from several countries, and lots of action. Because of the size of the battle you come to fully expect being set up for the next one. And, yes, we are set up. The humor here more understated than other Marvel films. There is some to be sure, and this movie lacks for it. When there's a massive war, something has got to give. The film has so much going on that character development is assumed from people watching the other Marvel Films. No time for characters here, just lots of action.", "My head is spinning. I'm both pumped up and in ruins over Infinity War. Tons of grand action sequences, each hero gets a fair amount of screentime, and there's a fine balance of charming fan service and heartrending suspense. It really went directions I didn't expect; Thanos turned out to be quite an emotionally complex villain. My gripes are mostly technical, just some sloppy editing and cinematography that plagued a couple action scenes and there were a few scenes where a hero's character development from a previous MCU entry was completely nullified, but I give it some leeway because it resulted in some pretty awesome fan service. Without spoiling anything, Infinity War lives up tremendously to its decade-long hype.", "In a nutshell, Infinity War is Marvel's version of Inception. Time is of the essence or is it? One shot at survival and 14 million chances to get it right? Baby Gamora balancing the weapon like the totem in Inception balancing the countless spins reality could take? \nAmongst the rubble of Titan, Dr. Strange sat like a static hissing telecommunication system, using his time stone to forsee a future where the Avengers get one shot and one shot alone, to set things right- to win the \"infinite\" war against Thanos. (The title of the film itself is very evocative.) \nThe irony of Thanos's \"mercy\" where he \"spares\" Toni's life is not lost to me. But hey we have a villain who keeps his word(in exchange fo the time stone). The Avengers have their super powers but Toni trumps them all because his gift is his mind. And that mind will resurrect and reboot the Marvel universe- no more tricks Thanos told the good doctor very sternly, well well Voldemort-Shrek hybrid, you have been played by the wizard. It's all about the long con, and those who think outcomes through patiently, don't lose any war, because they see beyond their pride and know when to attack- but most importantly when to retreat.\nIts \"strange\" how alike Toni and Dr. Strange are in their characters and yet one is flamboyant and the other restrained. No matter how he comes across, Toni is arrogant sure, but he's level headed, logical, genius and most importantly not egoistic. \nThe Dementor like creature that told Thanos to sacrifice a soul to get the soul stone out of Vormir, was nothing but a version of Thanos himself(like a horcrux), who is banished to Vormir, and left powerless, by the Avengers, who win the war in the infinite future. Its genius really.\nFrom start to finish, it was a visual treat. The battle in Wakanda, was something else entirely. Thor getting his new hammer and arriving in style in Wakanda, The tenderness between Vision and Wanda, gosh there are so many mouth watering treats, scene after scene. And the humour laced with the impending doom.\nThe heroes of the script apart from the writers, are the visual superheroes , the animators. Cant wait to see Marvel top this and set a new record by breaking their previous one.", "I saw \"Avengers:Infinity War\", starring Robert Downey Jr.-The Judge, The Shaggy Dog_2006; Chris Hemsworth-12 Strong, Vacation_2015; Benedict Cumberbatch-Zoolander 2, August:Osage County and Josh Brolin-Only the Brave, Sicario.\nThis is the best super hero movie that I have ever seen. It is the first part of a two part story-the second part will come out next year, as they were both shot at the same time. This is the 10th anniversary of the Marvel cinematic universe-the first movie being Iron Man in 2008-and I think the 19th movie overall. This one has almost any character you can think of-I read that there is about 64 main characters that show up. Thanos is the villain here, portrayed by Josh in magnificent form. He is after the 6 Infinity stones, incredibly powerful gem stones that when combined, would make him unstoppable. Each gem is in a different location and each has a different power; Space, Mind, Power, Reality, Time and Soul. Benedict is in possession of one, as is the Vision, so you can guess who is coming to town on a hunting spree. Robert and Chris both have their shots at Josh, with little chance of slowing him down. Why does Thanos want these gems so badly? He simply believes the universe is overpopulated-resources, food, etc.-and just wants to cull the herd a bit to make it a better universe for everyone else. He travels across the galaxy destroying about half of a planets population and smiles while he does it. The heroes have to unite in their fight and that's when you see some pretty awesome fights. And there are casualties-you might even say it's a bloodbath. And I'm talking some of the A-listers here. There is the usual Stan Lee cameo-look for him driving a bus full of kids-and there is a scene after the end credits, so don't leave too early-there is another casualty.\nIt's rated \"PG-13\" for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, language and crude references and has a running time of 2 hours & 29 minutes.\nI loved this movie and can hardly wait for part 2. I would buy it on Blu-Ray.", "A truly masterpierce! Everything in this movie is epic,incredible,emotional.", "The greatest trick Marvel pulled was making us believe that our heroes were invincible. Throughout every Marvel film, we've seen our characters get bruised and beaten - but emerge alive and ready to take on the next apocalyptic space baddie. But when Loki was strangled within the first five minutes, I knew we were in for a different kind of movie. The Marvel rules of who's safe and who's not don't apply here, and the story is all the better for it. This is the film where evil really, truly, wins.\nFor the sheer amount of characters, settings, and tones that needed to be juggled for a film like this, Infinity War knocked it out of the park. If there's a way it could've been handled better, I'm not sure what that is. Each character gets their fair amount of screen time, the action is self-consciously bold and fun, and the villain develops spectacularly. When it's funny, it's genuinely funny. When it's heartbreaking, it's genuinely heartbreaking. It just works. After almost a decade of waiting, Marvel has produced a theater experience I'll never forget. I can't wait to see what happens next.", "You've never heard a sound like the Rubberband man You're bound to lose control when the Rubberband starts to jam From the first moment Thanos appears on screen, the movie starts an emotional rollercoaster. With so many great characters there was bound to be great humor, but the Russos made a great coherent film with great story, visuals and drama. I love Infinity War, because of the great messages it brings across about friendship, setting aside differences, sacrifice, love and overpopulation. Prepare yourself for Thanos, because there hasn't been anyone like him, cause you're bound to lose control when he gets to use the Infinity Gauntlet.", "The movie is amazing!! It's is hilarious at parts. It is super sad at others. They did a good job incorporating all of the characters. Best MCU movie to date!! Left me speechless at the end!!", "This film is simply stunning, all the hype and antisipation do not do it justice. From the start it's all go and the first 10mins of the film ensure you go through a few emotions, Thanos is here. The story of how a group of superheros need to put differences aside to deal with the real end of world threat of Thanos is told to perfection, and how it all comes together is done in a way that now Marvel has a big problem!! How can Marvel top this non stop rollercoaster of torn emotions?? I'm trying my best to not write a spoiler here so my review is short and sweet. People have said the run time is too long and these folk are stupid as there are so many questions coming out of this film and believe me when I tell you, As soon as the film starts time goes by and you will leave the cinema not realising you just spend over 2hrs in their. This is the best film Marvel has done and will be impossible to top it", "Avengers : Infinity war is a movie which not just lived up but surpassed all the expectations. Its an intense movie with many fight sequence but also has its moments of fun. GOG Scenes with Thor add Iron man were the ones which will make anyone smile. even though the los our super heroes has gone through in the entire movie. There is not a single scene in movie which feels extra or unnecessary. All the actors have played their characters perfectly. Even we get to see the different aspects of Thanos personality and its just awesome.", "Like every other geek in the world, I was stoked to see 'Avengers: Infinity War.' I bought my tickets in advance. I got a soda that was way too large to drink in two and a half hours. I argued with some teenager who tried to steal my seat. I sat in jittery anticipation once the lights went down... And I was left wanting once the credits ran. 'Avengers: Infinity War' was the equivalent of Marvel's money shot. It's been building to this since the first 'Avengers' movie showed Thanos peeking over his shoulder with a cocky smile on his face. Since then, they've been hinting at the inevitable confrontation that was bound to happen between Earth's mightiest heroes and some big purple spaceman. With Avengers: Infinity War, we see Thanos actually get off his ass and do something, and he does a lot and yet nothing at the same time. The biggest problem that 'Avengers: infinity War' suffers from is that it tries to do so much in so little time. Fans of the MCU are well aware that there are more heroes than you can shake a stick at and 'Infinity War' stuffs all of them in, in one way or another. Of course, the big three (Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and Robert Downey Jr.) get their share of screen time, everyone else thought has minimal roles to play throughout the film. Tom Holland is Marvel's newest plaything, so he gets plenty of time, but the rest of the big heroes are shoehorned in \nsuch a way that screams \"contractual obligation.\" Then again, I don't think any fan is something to be upset about seeing their favorite heroes finally meet on the big screen (especially when it comes to Robert and Benedict Cumberbatch). The problem is that none of them really get a chance to stretch their legs. I have to admit 'Avengers: Infinity War' definitely has some feels in it. Oddly enough, most of these feels come from Thanos himself (Josh Brolin). He's supposed to be the big bad of the MCU, but it seems like his heart is in the right place, even if he's a pretty extreme pragmatist. Still, his character isn't laughing evilly in the wings as he commits acts on par with the worst war crime I can think of. Instead, he struggles. He sees the cost and even admits that achieving his goal costs him everything in the end. So, is it all worth it?  Who knows! The damn thing basically ends in a \"to be continued.\" 'Avengers: Infinity War' suffers from trying to do so much that the editing can't possibly keep up with it. There's no downtime between the action sequences, which doesn't mean that they aren't any less spectacular. It just means that there's no time to let anything sink in before the movie is rushing off to the next sequence. That being said, the heroes all achieve a new level of badass-dom, especially Chris Evans as Captain America. The guy is a beast this time around. Unfortunately, there is so much going on that it can be hard to figure out what's going on mid-flight.  This brings me to another point when it comes to 'Avengers: Infinity War.' The damn thing is so busy when it comes to its visuals, that I honestly don't think it's worth seeing in 3D. For the first few minutes of the movie, I couldn't understand what was happening. Apparently, though there was quite a beatdown when it came to Thanos and Hulk. Enough so that Hulk gets performance anxiety. Something I find odd since Thanos actively avoids the Hulk in the comics. I'm not going to knick pick about this though, because I'm not a neckbeard nerd. Look, here's the bottom line, 'Avenger: Infinity War' is a fun movie. It's competently made by the Russo Brothers, who are Marvel's golden boys. Is it everything that fan might want? No. Does it live up to what it promises? No. Is it still something fanboys should throw money at and be happy they get it? Probably.  You're not going to be disappointed in 'Avengers: Infinity War,' but Marvel does not have the right to act all high and mighty after this. I'm sure 2019 will bring a \"sequel\" that will make it all worthwhile. As of right now though, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is kind of a disappointment. It's a letdown. There have been so many good movies this past year from Thor: Ragnarok to Black Panther that Marvel ended up raised the bar. It had to stumble at some point, it's just lucky that it only stumbled and didn't fall flat on its face with 'Avengers: Infinity War.'", "Because this is a Marvel movie. We've been waiting for ages. 11/10 Epic action. Epic story. Epic emotion. Some surprise, ect. What do you expect for a movie?", "Awesome movie of the year.\nThe opening until the end is FIGHT!!", "10 years since 'Iron Man' commenced the cinematic universe. 10 years. Just let that sink in. Now, the superhero soap opera draws closer to its conclusion and the stakes are higher than ever. The Avengers, Guardians and a myriad of supporting heroes encounter the wrath of the villainous Thanos. They must unite and prevent him from harnessing all six infinity stones, because if he does...we all know what will happen. Total universal annihilation! With each chapter, the MCU becomes more and more predicable as the narrative follows the exact same three act structure. Whilst there is a tiny sense of predictability here, the sheer boldness of the Russo brothers' execution has made for an excitingly tense blockbuster that I'm sure will leave many in awe with what they just witnessed. The colossal enormity of this chapter, the raging pressure for the directors, the astronomical expectation from the fans, all immeasurable factors that somehow have been measured and implemented to create heroic entertainment. The intricate balance of all the superheroes felt like an impossible task, however each member received enough screen time to validate their presence within the story. All the actors performed with sincerity, particularly during the more emotional moments. Finally we are presented with a multi-dimensional antagonist who's motives, may unquestionably be evil, are nonetheless relatable. You see his perspective. The inclusion of Thanos' backstory and the focus on the ferocious power of the Infinity Gauntlet cements him as the strongest adversary within the MCU. Impressive visual effects and memorable action set pieces ensures the thrills are consistently imaginative throughout. It's certainly a behemoth, where the narrative's pacing is slightly inconsistent during the first half and the humour misses more than it hits, but with such confident direction they have made an impossible chapter possible. Geeks, fans and film lovers, rejoice! However that ending though, left me speechless...", "This is a great movie. I like the effect, the performance of the actor and actress, and the content. However, as an MCU fan, I have never read any Marvels' comics before. I do have a big shock from the ending. I am familiar with every MCU movie, and I watch them at least three times each. For some of them, I have watched over ten times. I can see those superheroes working hard on protecting the world, our world, Earth. But they failed, as the preview said.  There is one time I thought, that the preview is just a trigger for the interesting of fans. It means to attract people's attention. I never thought the director would shot the movie like these. For every superhero actor and actress, you all have my highest respect for your professional and your performance. Especially, I like the performance from Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch. They make their superhero character alive to us.  As a movie, I believe this is a great one. It is maybe the best superhero movie ever. The effect, the content, the performance, the way that the director shot it, as far as I know, I never saw a movie like this one. As a fan, I feel upset about the ending. It is now like that I do not accept the bad ending and I only want a happy ending. But this is desperation. They fight only leading to their failure. No matter what they do, they didn't change the end. Anyway, good job Marvel. It is a good movie.", "Fantastic in a sense that there are plenty of action and it's nice to see all heroes together, but it ends very abruptly with a cliffhanger where everyone is just confused.", "After 10 years of amazing movies, the Russo Brothers have managed to create a brilliant continuity to the stories and link them into 1. With amazing production and CG that rivals any I've seen before, I was taken into this universe and was part of every charachter's thoughts even the evil Thanos. Well played by all, well produced by Marvel, this movie is a definite must watch, Josh Brolin made me forget he was CG. Cannot wait for next year's installment", "A culmination of the first 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's kind of insane of far they've gotten. There isn't any major development on previously established characters in this one. But that's OK since we have 18 other movies where you can get to know everything about them. Thanos is the man who's at the core. It's really good because now the villain isn't sidelined at all. Bold chances are taken, which actually makes you feel the important weight that this movie needed to bring. All in order for it to leave a greater impact and resonance compared to what the MCU has done before. It's a theme park ride, but with real care put into it. It's not merely action and special effects for the sake of it. There's a real humanity at the core of this extravaganza. I'm the guy who doesn't read the Marvel comics. I've become a fan of these characters because of the MCU films. I knew nothing about Iron Man or Thor or Captain America. Now I have gotten to know them throughout the years thanks to this series and I feel a greater appreciation for them. The films haven't been fantastic masterpieces or anything, but they have given you what's necessary: An understanding of the hero. They have also brought some great fun and the adventure that you may want in a movie going experience. However, this time you are given something extra. There is a reward for having gone through 18 films. You can nitpick this because of tonal shifts and focusing on so many story-lines. I honestly think it's very impressive how it was put together in the end. Must have been a nightmare juggling what could have been a complete mess. Thankfully it isn't. Try to stay away from spoilers since this is definitely \"Mic Drop: The Movie\". I will say one last thing before ending the review and please stay with me on this one. People say that there's going to be Marvel fatigue because there's been so many superhero movies coming out every year. And with some of them I understand. The Repetitiveness has been felt. But look back at the 50's or 60's when the grand epic super-scope films were based on mythological stories or historical figures or biblical tales. Movies like \"Jason and the Argonauts\", \"Ben-Hur\", \"The 300 Spartans\" etc. Those were often pure spectacle with a huge scale and the masses went to see them because they were events. The plots were adapted from very old stories. Archetypical stories with classic heroes and villains. All of those stories have been adapted by now. So the Marvel films are kind of acting like an equivalent of that for modern times. The superhero stories are from newer sources, but they feature similar archetypes. They have pretty much become replacements of the epic films from back then. The mythological stories are much older than the comic books and are naturally more respected and known. Superhero tales are more recent, but when you break it down to the core, they carry on that legacy. So take it easy with them and enjoy the experience.", "I've never thought, ten years ago, that this is even possible. But thanks to the brilliant minds working in the MCU for piecing together all ten years of work into one grand film, and to the Russo brothers for doing their job again. This is not your conventional superhero blockbuster, MCU didn't push the safety button here, they went beyond anything we've ever experienced in a superhero movie. And they know they need to step up because this isn't an ordinary movie event, forget about the Justice League. From the opening scene, you can already sense the dread and the heaviness of this film, the humor is still there and the 'relief' in comic relief is more apparent this time because you can feel an air of unease throughout the film. It felt to me, though I'm not sure if it's intended, that Thanos is the center of the film, it was all about his character and his quest. And I liked that idea, it gives Infinity War another twist. I've got so much to say here, but I'll leave it in my second viewing.", "It's COLOSSAL. MONUMENTAL. EPIC! Indeed the biggest Hollywood movie of 2018. It's an EXPERIENCE. Avengers: Infinity War gathers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Spider-man (Tom Holland), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the rest of the Avengers together & unite in order to battle their most powerful enemy yet: the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin). On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.The hype that surrounds the movie is real. You haven't seen a film that puts together 19 of the biggest stars in Hollywood in one mega extravaganza. It's 2 hours & 29 minutes of big cinematic moments after another, with all possible elements of filmmaking combined together to make one gigantic film. You get your fill of action, comedy, suspense & a pinch of touching scenes in between. Like any film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you also get your fill of fantastic visuals, top notch editing & great cinematography from Trent Opaloch. Alan Silvestri, fresh from the success of Ready Player One, delivers another memorable musical score.Directors Joe & Anthony Russo gives us not only an unforgettable superhero film, but the biggest film of their lives. They also directed one of my favorite films in the MCU (Captain America: Civil War) so rest assured that this movie is in totally good hands. I was literally shookt when the film ended, was not able to stand up even after the end credit scene was shown because I still needed to process what just happened in the whole film. It's that good! My advice: JUST GO SEE IT! DON'T READ NO SPOILERS! Whether you're a Marvel fan or not, JUST GO SEE IT! ASAP!", "All I have to say is this: the Russo Brothers are not good film makers and I probably won't be seeing one of their films ever again.", "The movie was great and they manage to give screen time to almost all the characters, eventhough it is not an easy task. However, I don't understand why marvel use such crappy background music? Infinity war has horrible background score as if you are watching an 80s sci fi movie!", "A lot of jokes didnt land as expected and too much drag on the storyline with all heroes trying to earn their place in the movie", "Infinite war is not a bad movie at all, but I feel like people are overrating this movie way to much telling how amazing the acting, story, and scenes were.\nMaybe it's because I haven't watched all of the previews movie, but to me this was just something to waste some time with, it had some good moments but overall I wouldn't say it deserves to be so high on list.", "It's a perfect marvel movie. What else is there to say?", "Can't understand the hype. This movie is so bad on so many levels it is beyond words. Even the CGI is bad. Thanos looks like he came straight from a video game. The story is as banal as it can be. The plot nonexistent. I don't know maybe Im just too old for this s$#%..", "I would love to give this a 9.9 star rating! The only reason I took the 0.1 star off is because I hate that it just left me hanging!! It is torture! Can't wait to see what happens next. If you love Guardians of the Galaxy and the Thor movies, which are the only movies I am familiar with, you are going to have enough knowledge to love this. I don't know anything about Iron Man, Captain America, Dr Strange or Black Panther and I still loved this. Check it out.", "Excelent! Amazing Movie!\nExcelent! Amazing Movie!\nExcelent! Amazing Movie!\nExcelent! Amazing Movie!\nExcelent! Amazing Movie!", "One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around!", "Ok, first of all this is a cheesy pop corn movie. But hello, it is about superhero's. Ofcourse it's going to be tongue in cheek over top action. But it does it perfectly. Greatest movie of its genre and also has a bit of soul. The CGI and cast alone give it a 5 star rating. Then the movie itself rounds it off a ten. Yes ten as it doesn't put a foot wrong. Ignore the 1's. And 2's as they are just morons. Watch this movie but I'm guessing if you are reading this you already have.", "I'm a marvel fan, have been since day 1 and I can conclude that this film was simply the best it could have been! Every element you could think of, the cast the acting the CGI, cinematography, editing, it's all extraordinary in this movie to the point that marvel fans are most likely ecstatic about like I am! Everything we were hoping for and more was in this movie. Best MCU movie!! P.S Thanos is by far the best comic book movie villain of all time exceeding that of Heath Ledgers joker which I never thought would be possible but I'm anyone can do the impossible in cinema it's Marvel!", "I loved this movie and I saw it twice in the cinema. It was the third movie to make me cry. The other 2 were Wonder Woman and Love, Simon if that gives anything to go by. Good movie would recommend.", "Before I begin, there will be spoilers so you have been warned. Avengers: Infinity War directed by the Russo Brothers who also directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War is in my opinion not only the best Marvel movie ever but quite possibly one of the best superhero movies that I have ever seen. It has everything you can possibly want from a superhero film: high stakes, great action scenes, great acting, splendid dialogue, awesome special effects, and funny humor. The cast was great in this film but the star was 100% Josh Brolin as Thanos. He is hands down the best MCU villain and I know a lot of people have said that but I honestly believe this.\n First I want to talk about the overall scope of the film. This movie takes you to many places including Wakanda, Titan which is Thanos' home planet, New York, and other realms including Nidavellir. There are so many things that happen in the film with so many characters and I am impressed at how well the Russo Brothers manages to balance it. As Thanos quite put it, \"Balanced as all things should be.\" \n Next, the characters. I was a little disappointed when certain characters didn't get to meet other characters and I am hoping that they get to meet in the next movie. However, the best performance in this film is Josh Brolin as Thanos himself. He is one of the best movie villains I have ever seen. He had a good motivation though how he carried it out was flawed and he was not evil for the sake of being the villain. He wanted to help the world but in his own twisted way. The other characters were great in this film. I loved Thor's interaction with the Guardians of The Galaxy. Thor might also be one of the best parts of the movie and he really developed as a character. All of the other characters had a chance to shine. Tom Holland as usual was great as Spider-Man but I will get to his performance later. \n The special effects were great. The different environments looked so awesome and even though some of it was CGI it still looked great. The Wakanda fight scene was one of the best uses of CGI. It didn't look too cheesy and it was grounded. Avengers: Infinity War has one of the best fight scenes which was the battle on Titan. I loved the Wakanda battle but the Titan fight scene just blew me away. \n As soon as I came home from watching the movie I went to Spotify and added the whole entire soundtrack to my playlist. I loved seeing Alan Silvestri return to score the film. The score from the first Avengers film is one of my favorite superhero movie scores. This one is slightly darker and gives a feeling of dread to the film as well as melancholy. I also love that he only uses the Avengers theme at appropriate times such as when Captain America appears out of the shadows or when Thor enters Wakanda (Which is one of the most epic entrances I've ever seen!!). The score \"Even For You\" is really emotional and I nearly cried listening to it. \n Finally, the death scenes. It is hard to choose which death made me the most sad. Oh who am I kidding? Obviously Spider-Man made me the most emotional but Groot and Loki were also sad. I kind of knew Gamora was going to die so that wasn't as sad but it still hurt me. \n Overall, the film was a masterpiece and told a great story and balanced so many characters in one movie. It also gave us a sympathetic villain and great fight scenes as well as great character arcs.", "I waited years for this movie and it definitely did not disappoint. I saw this movie 3 times because I loved it so much and I enjoyed the expirence. Marvel definitely knows what they're doing unlike DC. Infinity war is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and i can't wait for part 2.", "Not predictable with the finger snap at the end just when you think it's over...", "The most anticipated movie of the year did not disappoint. The acting and cinematography blew me away. All characters where absolutely fantastic and Thanos is a great villain. Easily one of the best movies of the year. 9/10", "There is honestly nothing to complain about with this movie. The entire Avengers series has led up to this moment. Now, i know there's a second part coming soon, but as far as the first part is concerned, it started off great following the events of Civil War and Ragnarok, the characters are great as ever, the action was awesome, and the comedy was spot on, I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire movie. There is no reason any person shouldn't watch this. Great movie for all.", "Honestly would pay to see in theaters again. The amount of time, effort, and creativity this series has is amazing.", "This is the movie I've been waiting for ever since Thanos was shown at the end of \"The Avengers\" and it was worth the wait. War is right because there is so much action, funny, sad but worth every second. Though I would have expected it to be a little bit more serious in the matter since Thanos is trying to wipe off half the population. Bubbles was not necessary for this film either and the Black Order was not as powerful as I would expect them to be. In all though a fantastic film with such a great villain in Thanos. He lives up to his nickname the \"Mad Titan\" and he's basically the main character in this film since he has character build up than any other character in the film. If there is any superhero movie to be seen this year it is this one none can come close to this amazing film!!", "Great movie! Lots of fun. It is really fun for me to watch the marvel movies as I read a lot of the comics as a kid. It's innocent fun with relatable themes for anyone with any sense of empathy. I can't believe all the negativity but I guess it's a sign Marvel is doing something right.", "As far as superhero movies go, even if you have never seen the other movies, this is by far the greatest comic book movie ever done! It has everything, from action to drama to comedy to tragedy. If you want to truly be entertained, then GO SEE THIS MOVIE!", "When this movie was announced I was super hyped for it & after seeing it on opening day I will gladly say that this movie did not disappoint in the slightest, not only is this the best MCU movie but it's the best comic book movie period. Also without revealing too much I just wanna say that you should be sure to bring a box of tissues with you when you see it.", "Excellent movie super stars every scene Best superhero movie ever", "I was so looking forward to this film and it did not disappoint. Epic action scenes and just the right amount of humour. I enjoy the references to the other Marvel films and I would say this is my second favourite (after Thor Ragnarok). Can not wait for the second and make sure you stat til after the end credits finish", "Give him the stones! He must save us all from the world before us. THANOS ATTENBOROUGH", "I've heard Avengers: Infinity War paralleled with Empire Strikes Back - not a bad comparison. Fantastic movie. If it's not the best Marvel has made, its definitely one of them. If you liked the original Avengers movie, this one will blow your mind. It's so great to see everyone together, to have Thor with the Guardians, to watch Iron Man and Spider-Man fight alongside Quill and Doctor Strange. I've seen this twice already, and I'll be seeing this yet again for sure. The wait for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4 is gonna be harder than ever.\nTimes cried: 2", "First of all i want to thank Russo bros for creating this amazing thing. We have a villain called Thanos in this movie and he is quite different from the other villains. He just doesn't kill people for fun he has his very own purpose for doing it he even had to sacrifice his own daughter. It showed us he still had some feeling left inside him. Seeing these things in a villain makes me happy.  I was so bored of superheroes are winning it all in the end but this time we lost some VERY cool heroes. Like spider-man. I couldn't watch his death the way he said those things to Mr. Stark.. (Props to Tom Holland btw for his acting ).  Finally, the smile Thanos gives at the end of the movie. That kind of pissed me off and at the same time made me happy for him because he did what he wanted.  If you love superhero movies then don't even wait just go see the movie you will thank me.", "This is a surprisingly bold and unexpected movie disguised as a summer blockbuster. Excellent choices by Marvel. Just know that you really must see all, or at least most, of the previous Marvel movies to get the full impact of this.", "A nice movie with good fight scenes, and some funny parts, like for example the interaction between Thor and the \"rabbit\".\nOne extra point for featuring beautiful Scarlett who sadly does not appear a lot.", "Simply outstanding. Simply outstanding. Simply outstanding. Simply outstanding.", "Major spoilers ahead. Finally, after years of waiting, Infinity War has finally dropped and is gathering more attention than every other movie combined. This is nothing new to the MCU, as their movies typically take over when they arrive; not that this is a bad thing, but it's true. With Infinity War, Earth's mightiest heroes Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and The Hulk, alongside Black Widow, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther, Spider-Man, the Guardians of the Galaxy (you can see there's an abundance of characters), etc, find themselves on the brink of total wipeout as the powerful mad titan, Thanos, arrives on earth to collect the remaining infinity stone(s) and achieve what he believes will be world peace. This is far from true because in actuality, he could very well destroy half of the Universe. Thanos uses the powerful infinity gauntlet which obtains all of the infinity stones. With this, Thanos is almost immortal, and wields powers that are limitless... It is up to the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and their allies to try and stop Thanos and help save humanity before it's too late, as it can very well be destroyed with the snap of his fingers. Let me tell you this, after ten years of MCU, this is definitely a fitting forefront and makes for a massive achievement. The thing that astounds me is that this is the first of what would originally be two parts, and I honestly cannot see how they will top this, (and although it was announced it would serve as its own film, I still see it as a part II to an extent, although it will be the fourth Avengers movie overall, of course). The big question, which is of course one of many, is... Do the Avengers stop Thanos? Simply put, no they do not. They do not succeed in stopping him, and many of them perish at the very hands of him. Who are some of the heroes we see die? Well, there's a plethora of dead heroes now, and some of them include Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Vision, Black Panther, Star-Lord, Gamora, and Loki, among others. Obviously they're not all dead, the likes of Spider-Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and some of, if not all the Guardians will come back in the next film - whether it be reversed time or the quantum realm. Or, you know, some other, unpredictable way which throws us off guard like many of the deaths during this film did. The film is fantastic from start to finish, doesn't lose its serious and heartfelt moments to humor (and the humor is balanced out and structured well), has an array of lovable characters and is stuffed and packed full of action, with tremendous visual effects that are at the top of their game. It's funny, thrilling, brutal and bold, all in one. Some characters I feel, of course, stand out more than others, but they're all good. A few of my favorites include Thor, Iron Man, Spidey, Captain America, The Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Star-Lord, Doctor Strange, and of course, Thanos himself - who at times I must admit, I was rooting for, despite rooting for the Avengers overall as a collective whole. There are moments where you feel bad for Thanos (or maybe not, to each their own and so on, so forth lol). I did. But of course, it gets more emotional and heartfelt and mind-boggling as the film progresses. It is truly epic, each and every scene and act. This is definitely going to surpass many a film and I seriously believe that it is the biggest film of all time - even if it doesn't surpass the box office record for the highest-grossing movie of all time, I believe it is the most well-known film because of its status, the fact that it's already breaking records, and it's total, cumulative views regarding its trailers and teasers. And of course, it's Marvel, man, which really speaks for itself... Just go and see it and have fun! But not too much fun, because fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe, even if it puts a smile on your face.. EDIT: 06/07/2019 -- I must admit, despite the fact I enjoy ENDGAME a little more overall, I feel INFINITY WAR will age better of the two of them for some reason. I feel in regards to actual narrative and storytelling, INFINITY WAR gets the upper hand. This movie offers an abundance of fight sequences and action that will take your breath away, and to this day I cannot stop watching the epic battles of Wakanda and Titan. Thanos couldn't have been pulled off any better in this film either, and truly it captures the essence of what an amazing antagonist should be...", "The wait is finally over and the war is here. Infinity war is a masterpiece and marvel has once again exceeded expectations which were already set high. The movie ends on a huge cliff hanger and I can't wait to see what happens next", "I walked into this frightened that there would be too man characters and the result would be an empty vacant shell of a movie that was pulled in so many different directions it couldn't make sense of itself. Yay, I was wrong. Seriously, they did a good enough job. They focused on Gomorrah, Thor, and Strange and Stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. And the rest they used as filler, with only the Vision story coming up a bit light due to population. And the Vision story was a bit of a draw back. It was there but it wasn't, but at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too much so. The Humor was also scaled back. But Spider Man did a good job, Cap had a few and laughs,and yet again, it was only Panther and the Wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a Marvel movie. I'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the MCU that it is fine if the Black Panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. We won't mind. The tone was more action than action/comedy...but with \"War\" in the title, you kind of expect that. However, they do NOT even address the elephant in the room...why did Widow go blond? Was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. The world may never know. What we do know is that we missed Hawkeye, even if he is on and off again retired. And we missed Ant-Man, but given how many people were here, the absences were noted but not really noticed.", "Grade: A Rating: PG-13, 156 minutes (the longest Marvel film to date) In a Nutshell: Starring...well....EVERYONE! All of your favorite Marvel superheroes get spotlighted, a difficult task that the Russo brothers capably tackled. As the 19th film released by Marvel Studios in the past 10 years or so, with more to hit the Big Screen next month and into the summer of 2018, clearly, Marvel is the big boy at the Box Office. I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time and I don't want to include a bunch of spoilers here, so this review will be, surprisingly, quite short! I want you to be able to experience all of the fun excitement and heartbreaking drama for yourself.  The one word that truly describes this movie is EPIC. \nUplifting theme: \n\u00b7 Hope and desperation\nSacrifice for others\nRevenge\nLove\nThe price of war\nFriendship, forgiveness, mending old wounds\nGenocide Tips for parents: \nSome profanity, but no F-bombs.\nLOTS of violence, sometimes with bloody, brutal deaths. Super high dead body count. \nLOTS of destruction and people in perilous situations.\nSome characters we have come to know and love actually die in this movie. Your heart will break. It's a bit surprising and especially sad for people who really love these characters.\nSome creepy, scary monsters and characters.\n  Things I liked:\nI loved it when the superheroes met each other for the very first time. The audience I watched the movie with especially howled with laughter when the Guardians of the Galaxy (my favorite Marvel characters) meet Thor.\nJosh Brolin as Thanos is awesome. Thanos is a truly evil villain because of his motivation.\nThe humor is perfect. The characters play off each other really well with extremely entertaining banter.\nI'm not a fan of the \"shaky cam\" technique, so I was grateful that the Russo brothers were careful not to use it much. There is, however, a LOT of action, so you'll want to sit towards the back of the theater in order to see it all without getting dizzy.\nMarvel's storytelling has an unpredictability to it that makes it even more fun for viewers and fans. You just can't always predict what's going to happen. \nKeep watching after the rolling credits for a final scene that hints at what's to come. The good news is that there is more to come! \nI love it when Marvel gives Stan Lee a cameo spot. It's always so fun to see where they put him in the movies.\nIron Man's new nano-tech uniform was super cool.\nI adore Paul Betany and loved seeing him \"not\" red for a short time.\n Fantastic fight and action sequences.\nImpressive CGI. It's truly amazing what they can do in film nowadays.   Things I didn't like:\nWhen you mix that many bigger-than-life characters, the film is bound to be crowded, busy, and uneven in tone.\nThe ending is a bit vague and unfinished. We don't quite know what happened, but one thing is certain...there will be a grand finale! It kind of feels like the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was good, but somewhat unsatisfying because you knew you'd have to wait another year for the rest of the story.\nQuite a few Avenger-related characters were not present.\n You really need to have seen all of the recent Marvel movies in order to understand the back stories of the characters and appreciate the many Easter eggs and jokes. Funny lines:\n\"Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe, but this does put a smile on my face.\" - Thanos (Josh Brolin\n\"Hunk a Hulk of burning love is our favorite.\" - Wong (Benedict Wong)\nHe's not a dude. You're a dude. He's a man. A muscular man.\" - Drax (Dave Bautista) talking about Thor.\n\"It's like a pirate had a baby with a angel.\" - Drax talking about Thor\nKevin Bacon joke. Ha ha Love it.\n\"I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.\" - Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.)\n\"You speak Groot?\" - Rocket (Bradley Cooper)\n\"Yes, they taught it on Asgard.

It needs correction.\" - Thanos\n\"The hardest choices require the strongest will.\" - Thanos", "Freaking amazing!!! I still can't gasp what I just saw...it was effectively moving & superbly action-packed that comes with a jaw dropping ending which may going to disappoint some moviegoers but I'm sure it'd really make sense to the true comicbook fans. Kudos to the MCU team for making it so bold & masterfully crafted. Some may find lack of concentration or character development for some of their favorite characters but as a whole it didn't bother me much, cause you can't expect each & every character of MCU to shine in their own way of glory in one single movie. Moreover, there's the sequel coming next year and that's where many possibilities lies, even changing the course of its reality!\nBtw, THANOS RULES!!! Awesome character building & surely going to be one of the best superhero movie villains of all time.", "I didn't watch this movie expecting to be impressed. While I enjoy comic movies, they're typically shallow and seem to often follow the same format. Today, that means the more explosions, the better. So, I go in with low expectations and, thus, can't be disappointed. I have to say that I'm surprised at how high the rating is for this right now. A 9 seems a bit excessive. This movie is basically the Avengers on steroids. There are WAY too many characters and WAY too many plots going on here. Perhaps I'm a bit slow, but I found it difficult to keep track of everyone and what they were doing.  Rule #1 for any film should be to know your limits. There's at least 15 major characters in this movie who aren't working as a collective, but splitting into groups to conduct their own missions. Sure, it was supposed to contribute to the overall goal of stopping Thanos. However, the reality was that there were about four or five different plots going on within this movie. Too many for a 2-hour movie. Because I was juggling trying to keep up with the various plot lines, I ended up having trouble understanding what the characters were trying to accomplish in their individual groups. It just became a muddled mess. I sort of understood what the aims were near the end, but that made for a dragging movie experience. Marvel is the latest in a series of studios who are trying to squeeze money out of customers through an unnecessary two-part finale. Honestly, whether it was Tony trying to save Strange or Thor creating some weird, mystical ax, most of the plots were too long. I would've been fine if they'd condensed this movie into the first hour or so of a single film. This isn't to say the film has no merits. I enjoyed the duality of Thanos as a power-hungry villain and a sympathetic father. It makes for a more interesting bad guy, in my opinion.  This is still a decent movie. It's got plenty of humor and action for superhero fans who enjoy other Marvel films. However, I'd just advise watching it with caution. It could take more than one time watching to understand the unusual plot lines, and it may even lag at points for some viewers. But it's worth watching at least once.", "As a long time marvel fan this did not disappoint. Sometimes if was like wait what cause so much going on and still unsure as to where one of the stones came from but I blame the shit Thor movies for that. Awesome see - need to go again!", "10 years and 18 movies, we've waited and waited for our childhood fantasies to come to the big screen. This movie doesn't disappoint. In true marvel form, it gives us all the action and laughter we want, along with a wonderfully put together story. Bringing together this cast of well established characters was an awesome feat and done to perfection. Each character has their own set of little things that make them great and it was truely cinematic gold to watch these hero's meet one another. Action packed and edge of your seat adventure. There are surprises and cliffhangers and I'm sure Infinity Wars 2 will be just as entertaining.", "Marvel's Avengers : Infinity war left me with mixed feeling of joy and sorrow at the same time. I left the theatre depressed and needed some alone time to mourn. Hats off to The Russo brothers for making a movie that is not only as accurate as the comicbooks but also the biggest blockbuster live-action superhero movie ever made. It was Epic, Emotional, Great Story, Eye-popping Visuals, Well-paced, Major cliffhanger, surprising moments and many more. As for the Villain, Marvel did it again after Black Panther with a Great Story arc to set up the character of the Villain. You have to love the character as well as you will fear the character. Josh Brolin did a fantastic job with Thanos, His voice is just too perfect, just scared the heck out of me. I just made Thanos my favorite Villain no.2.  As for the story, A big cliffhanger in the end will left you in tears but don't worry \"Captain Marvel\" is coming to save us all. I am going to cry till the next movie comes out :( :( ;_; .", "I have a love hate relationship with these Marvel films. Six of them I like (IM 1-3 SPH GOG TR) one that I really dislike (BP) and the rest I don't really care about.  So I'm not the biggest fan of these movies, but this one does really have me interested and I kinda want to know what happens next.  As the filmmaking goes, it's average. The Russo Brothers proved that they are good action directors with Winter Solider and Civil War, which those two are better films action wise, the action is this is fun but it has that shaky cam that was featured in Civil War. It's not as bad in the final climax but it's very noticeable throughout, not to say that's a bad thing. The handheld style in a scene of panic works very well if handled right.  If you love the characters you'll probably love this. When the GOG show up it feels like a GOG movie with the dialogue sounding like it was written by James Gunn. \nSpider-Man was great, Tom Holland proved himself to be a great Spidy with SMH. \nI'm not as big as a fan of the new more serious Iron Man. I'm more in love with the comedic side of Stark which hasn't been present in the last two films.  The big problem I have is that it does feel way to clustered. One scene will happen and it will cut back to another scene with different characters that we almost forgot about until they showed them again. Each side story these characters have does have a revolution but they cut back and forth so many times you don't feel connected with them.  A few editing choices that where distracting. Two fade in shots half way in the film was very poorly done.  Over all it is a dumb fun popcorn film. If you love all these characters and all the marvel films that build up to this, I'm sure you'll all eat it up. \nBut top 250 worthy? I don't think so.  6/10", "Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.", "This is the movie we've been waiting for. The big villain, the big story, almost all of our heroes working together. In the last ten years, all MCU movies built up to this moment. And we're not just seeing the big heroes, but also their sidekicks. This isn't just another Avengers movie, this is Avengers\u00b3. I was really worried. These were the questions on my mind : 1. Would it all work out? 2. Would all the different movie styles mesh together? 3. Would it make for a coherent, satisfying story? 4. Could enough characters get their own moments? 5. Would the movie dare to try enough new things? 6. Now that they cut the story in half, would the movie have a satisfying ending? 7. Would I want to watch this movie again and again? Would it be a great movie that I'd want to watch many times? The answer to all questions is: Yes. 1. It all works out and makes for a great and epic movie. It's fast, it's exciting, it's funny, it's scary, it's dramatic. Marvel has not forgotten how to make movies. 2. The styles blend in flawlessly. Because the story takes place in different places, not all characters meet, so that definitely helps. And when they do, they are suitably introduced to each other. It never felt weird; if anything, it set up for some hilarious jokes. 3. The story is fast and feels like it could be spread out a bit more, but there's a lot of depth here. Thanos makes for a better villain than I dared to hope. 4. There are several great character stories here. A few sidekick characters only do some fighting and hardly get any lines, but most characters definitely get their awesome moments. The character interaction always feels very good. 5. The movie really dares to go where others did not. Not just in scale but also in drama; this is probably the most dramatic MCU movie to date. 6. Don't worry, the movie doesn't stop halfway the story. There's cliffhanger, sure. You'll be dying to see the sequel, sure. People will complain about the ending, sure. But it all works out. Next year, we can organize some great 5 hour's marathons. 7. There is so much to see and enjoy in this movie, I'll be watching it again and again. I daresay this is the most enjoyable Avengers movie to date.", "Really good story. This marvel movie wasn't like the others, best marvel movie so far", "I have no words for the but wow. The movie was so great and the story was just amazing. It's extremely unexpected and was way more sad then Logan. I can't believe that Red Skull appeared and that nearly all the Guardians are gone along with Groot (I am sad). This is definitely not the end cause Spider-man is having at least another 2 more movies confirmed by Kevin Feige and nobody can kill Groot, not even the all powerful Thanos with all the Infinity Stones. But in general it was AWESOME, especially the end with the Avengers in Wakanda trying to kill Thanos and defeats one by one like they were ants (sorry Ant-Man), and last things last the Soul Stone was finely found at last, but my only problem was that Doctor Strange gave the Time Stone away to easily there must be some spell or trick cause if not why give the life of half the universe for some guy who is dying (ok I understand that guy is Iron Man but still not even he is worth an Infinity Stone). So there we go sorry for short review and can't wait for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4 that are coming out next year.", "So balance... funny, heroic, sad, thrilling, mysterious, savage all in one screen. Can't wait to see the next chapter", "Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel's latest blockbuster, actually got more right than I expected. The opening scene started with a good amount of tension, people died right away, and you begin to think this might be their best one yet. Then. The first half an hour ends and the film becomes utterly consumed by a horde of swarming side plots and then completely falls apart in one of the most excruciating drops from decently engaging to excruciating I can think of.\nWith each added character, the emotional stakes lessen and lessen until all you have left is a mental checklist of who you think is going to die. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem but for two things: the Russo bro's utter incompetence in crafting well-made action scenes, and the laughable ridiculousness of the script's attempts to be philosophical.\nFirst off, the action scenes. They retain some trippy visuals and entertain on the basic level, but for the most part are reduced to illogical CGI barf where characters are flung around and punched like rag dolls. Yes, the superheroes get beaten in the end, but you never doubt for a second that they will be able to fix it; the climax would have had more emotional heft if Iron Man wasn't always transforming like a liquid Terminator and if Spider Man could quit sprouting more arms and superpowers. All these little pop-up tricks really undermine whatever stakes there are supposed to be in this movie. It's a problem I have with superhero movies in general, that we're watching powerful people beating other powerful people, and succeeding because they have more powers, etc. It just doesn't make a good story. The action culminates, meanwhile, in a massive, shaky-cam, lamely choreographed battle which was probably meant to evoke the Lord of the Rings but I kept getting flashbacks to the Phantom Menace. (Bubble shield to cover the good guys, check. Miniature bubble shields for good guy troops, check. Giant bad guy troop carriers, check. Hordes of cannon-fodder troops, check. What visionaries the Russos are). Once again, the Avengers' strategy is to charge their enemies-forget it, that doesn't even work as a strategy. The battle then revs up and we are treated to so many acts of maximum destruction that all impact is lost. It's like watching a house of cards being atomic bombed. Then, due to a series of tactical blunders, they lose anyway. Just one way for them to win, Doctor Strange says? You might want to check another couple million possibilities because you probably overlooked something. Okay, on to the script. It attempts to philosophize with its pretty lame villain, Thanos, who is only considered great because he has been teased for so long he must be good, right? He isn't. The movie doesn't even offer any reason why he's wrong other than \"You just can't kill people!\". Well, he's saving the environment, I'm sure Michael Moore would encourage him. The whole thing is just ridiculous. Besides, if he's so concerned about the universe's 'finite resources', why doesn't he just use the all-powerful Infinity McGuffins to create more resources instead of killing a bunch of people? Can he not do this even when he has a 'reality stone' that controls reality or something like that? It's total nonsense. The writers are good at making you laugh, but when it comes to anything serious or thought provoking they're doomed. Well, at least we still have the characters, and seeing them lose was pretty refreshing after their string of 20 some victories. But then you get on to Endgame, and this movie looks like an artistic masterpiece...", "It seems to be a rule that Marvel movies are at their weakest the more superheroes are thrown in at once...which is confirmed by any new, pumped up Avengers movie that is weaker than it's predecessor...this was really hard to watch through...guess I'll skip Endgame because nothing good can come out of it...", "If you've seen all the marvel films, without thinking about the comics as I have seen a few people have on the reviews. This film is amazing. Pulls you from ecstasy to dispair and back again 3 times over. The deaths involved are really sad (I cry every time) & the meetings with Tony & his dad were amazing. One of my favourites films, it's not the best films in terms of screenplay but the way it ties 22 films together I think Russo brothers have nailed it.", "Irman died i do not like this end he is the best man in the world i like him", "Most of the characters can only leave an impression of the last moment of death.", "This is a culmination of over fifteen movies and an improvement on a very high bar which was set. Bringing together an even bigger cast many of which I could never picture together only a few years ago. From the outset this is a roller coaster which blends heart breaking tragedy, breathless action and pure drama oh and not to mention some well blended comedy at key moments. Hard to find a fault with this movie but can not wait to see if they can lift the bar even further in future.", "This movie I believe was the best part of the Avengers series. Great story, brilliantly portrayed, dialogues on point and the emotionally attachment with the audience", "This movie did wonders for the MCU, it created hype for the somewhat disappointing Avengers Endgame, it left audiences at the edge of their seat during every fight as the tug of war between Thanos and the Avengers was always so violent and unpredictable that truely anyone could have won at the end of this film. Although not perfect, and suffers from multiple forced events and ever changing power levels of some characters, the 3rd Avengers film was a rightful success to the first two.", "A legendary film that needs to be watched by all. Amazing story, graphics, and performances by all.", "What an incredible film. After watching every movie in the series, to see them come together like this is really something special.

Can't wait to see josh do thanos again", "This is a reversal of the previous two \"Avengers\", this time obviously did not complete a story, but left the suspense. The broken relationship between Captain America and Iron Man has not been eased by the coming of the Bully. Just because of frequent patronage, it seems to work hard to protect the earth together. From this point, it is not difficult to see that Marvel is still worried about the separation between the American elite society and the grassroots society. However, due to the second generation of Thor, the desolate god, it is not ugly to let the Avengers split. But on the whole, the Avengers in this work did not play as a whole, but divided into two teams to fight each other, which also led to the destruction of the bully. Judging from the battles in this work, Thor, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and even Black Panther still play a larger role. Here, we see the role of the Avengers \"elite\" alliance, and the role of the Avengers \"grassroots\" alliance is mainly in the sensational and clear soldiers. Raytheon, as the second generation of the desolate god, has experienced the tragic situation of his girlfriend running away, the whole family dying, and his home destroyed. The son of Odin, who was once reckless and arrogant, after having no father and no weapons, after cleaning the lead, finally took on the name of Thor, and he was relentlessly looking for the opportunity for revenge, and he was almost Succeeded. Every hero may be carrying a tragic past. But by being unyielding and tenacious, he eventually became a hero. The image of Thor in this work is quite perfect, even surpassing the traditional Captain America. This also expresses the director's expectations of the \"elite\" with Thor in the background. Iron Man Tony actually wanted to be a dad, perhaps because of his love for Spider-Man. Let him realize that he is no longer, that young master who can do whatever he wants. The life of the rich second generation born with the golden key has also experienced inhuman suffering. Under the bright appearance, it is still full of danger and fear. He is thinking about all the time, what a powerful alien army will bring to the earth. It is this sense of responsibility and care for his juniors that made him have no hesitation in the face of the onslaught. It is also the closest time they have collided with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man. Unfortunately, the restless Star Lord broke everything. This is not to blame the recklessness of Xingjue, after all, he is not yet a good commander, or just a restless big boy. On the other hand, Captain America, a \"traditional hero\", can be said to be pitiful in this film. It has not shown its previous command role, and has also published too many exciting words. Perhaps Marvel wanted to weaken the American team's role in order to attract more young audiences, or it may be to pave the way for subsequent heroes. On the whole, this hero who has been in a position to \"treat the crime\" has not been vindicated, and the mainstream will inevitably not promote a \"criminal\" too much. The role player Chris Evans may also give up playing the role in the future, all of which have led to the marginalization of the role of Captain America in the film. To say that the most outstanding in this work, there is no doubt that the villain tyrants. This wise man pursuing the so-called \"balance\" seems interested in the slaughter. Of course, every villain must have a set of philosophical theories. This time it is the so-called master control of the collapse of the world and the response to the exhaustion of resources. Marvel's classic villains always like to use these \"strongman tyrants\". They are ruthless, crazy, and overbearing. This tyrant is no exception. Not only did the Hulk Hulk stay down, but he also adopted his daughter Kamora as the material for the sacrifice. Destroyer relies on his hard-working style, without alliances and without any effective assistants, he has gathered 6 gems and opened his fingers. Still under the layers of siege of the Avengers, escaped dashingly. Facing the ideal sunset, he showed a fatherly smile. The Avengers met the strongest opponent. It seems so impeccable, especially after winning the wish, it should be matched with the song \"How Lonely is the Invincible\" to reflect his status as the boss of the rivers and lakes. But when we look back, he is indeed lonely. No one understands his so-called mission and responsibility, and no one supports it. In particular, his carefully cultivated daughter \"Kamora\" became the person who hated him the most. I do n't know if I should call him an \"idealist\" or an ambitious person. After deciding to give up his daughter 's life, this figure with contradictions in his heart will inevitably go further and further on the path of the husband. And if a person has the right to destroy with a single finger, the general life of the universe. How should he manage himself? The bully used people's emotions to get pieces of gems. From the beginning, Rocky, who wanted to protect his brother, to Kamora, who wanted to protect his sister, and Dr. Strange, who wanted to protect Iron Man, and the Scarlet Witch, who wanted to protect Vision. Any one of them, the heart of the heart, the dream of tyrants to collect gems, may be broken. But anyone can make mistakes, and the protection of family and friends cannot be regarded as complete mistakes. It's just that ordinary people will not be shameless and use their emotions to make transactions. Perhaps when you use emotions to make transactions, you are not far away from the achievements of bullying. The movie stopped abruptly after the destruction of half of the entire universe. Leaving us a bit of a question, such as whether Iron Man and Captain America will join forces? For example, can those people who disappeared eventually be resurrected? Another example is why Dr. Strange would surrender to the Iron Man, and surrender the gem of time? Can even Dr. Benny become the Hulk? All these questions, like the last egg, are full of reverie. But in the face of such a huge market, Marvel is bound to earn more eyeballs and money. This work can be said to have jumped out more successfully. Before that, there were concerns about \"superhero\" fatigue. I believe that before the end of this tyrant series story, fans will still have a very high enthusiasm for the Marvel series, so let us wait and see. In the end, \"Avengers 3\" as the finale of Marvel's 10 years, fully reflects the unparalleled advantages of the American film industry. These American-style \"superheroes\" help the United States promote their \"American-style culture\" around the world. But thinking about it in depth, what is the difference between this so-called spread and the tyrant? After all, a diverse world is a beautiful world. Any civilization and culture has its own opportunity to choose its own existence. But the aggression displayed by American culture makes people shudder. Therefore, if China wants to maintain its own autonomy, it must produce its own superhero to fight against the possible invasions. Of course, this first step may still be a reference.", "It is recommended that you drink less water, because this is almost a zero point movie, nearly two and a half hours from beginning to end. A few places do not play, or the place that the rhythm is more gentle has before and after looking after, is not idle pen. Although there are a lot of violent scenes, there are also plenty of funny points, and all kinds of jokes are everywhere, forming a buffer between the endless fierce battles. (although I'm not happy with the Internet slang used in the subtitles) and iron man is as mean and fart as ever, the captain of the solemn veteran + commissioner, brother hammer that pose is show MOE, there is a reference to the original black widow sister and hawkeye relationship, and finally see a brain of Dr. Banner. As an adaptation, there are many things to please comic fans, including classic lines. Original characters like agent colson are also great (my favorite in the whole series). His final performance may feel a little bit overrated, but for him, it's actually dark in his belly, so deep in his consciousness that all he can think about is how to make the most of the situation. Although it draws a lot of elements from the ultimate universe, including the characters' costumes and the names of alien RACES, the movie is not the world view of the ultimate universe. It seems to be a mix of the main world and the ultimate world. Loki says that he has an army, and that the aliens are really tough hybrid soldiers without any of the machismo of the original, but the post-credits Easter egg reveals that the really tough guys are still out there. As a group of heroes, the film is thoughtful: each character has enough to show for their character and ability, and the interaction between them is interesting. Avengers protagonist, is a team. The growth of the protagonist, here is the team of the run-in. See them from each other pk (this pk has a tribute to the original reason), to two cooperation, and then to the overall cooperation, the context and rhythm are very clear. Unlike the x-men, which are dominated by young students, the avengers are established heroes. So the movie borrows entirely from the comic book model of the year -- starting with the individual story of each member and then the origins of the team. Marvel had previously used five feature films plus two shorts as a starting point. Therefore, it does not need to explain the history and background of each person in detail in the film, but only carries out the \"simplest\" explanation, showing the core characteristics of each character. (the better part is showing another aspect of the hulk, Bruce banner as a famous scientist, which the hulk lacks.) This spare time is all focused on the core events, so the film can climax, burning the sky. This is a good example of how to make a team of heroes, but can this model be copied? Who could have done ten hours of foreplay for a movie that always had an orgasm?\n(I saw this film, dc pressure is very big, I hope one or two films against the sky, after all, it is not as good as M's solid accumulation of six years)", "Infinity war is fantastic! It and Endgame make watching all the previous MCU movies so worth it. The best part is seeing a villain be truly powerful and ultimately to the point of defeat. After watching movie after movie of the superheroes coming out top, never really losing anything meaningful to them. We get a much better look at who these characters are when they've lost all around them. Thor especially is interesting to see him continually getting broken down. Thanos' minions were a waste of time. They were quickly dispatched, especially the crew on the ship. Gamorah and Nebula were excellent again. I pretty much really enjoy any scene they're in. Their character arcs are again advanced well in this movie especially with the death of Gamorah. Lucky Thanos came with someone to sacrifice, otherwise he'd be a bit stuck. I appreciated the pace of the movie in the fact that it didnt drag out over two or three movies for Thanos to get the stones, instead it increased the fear by the urgency required as he gathered all six. As you knew more and more that they were going to lose, it forces you to be more invested and the anxiety is much more intense, with such a high point of ending. It was also so good having all the characters together, working together. This was well balanced and trumped Avengers 1 and 2. They moved on from trying to have cool 360 degree fighting shots to actually advancing the story. And in fact the fight scenes they did have were much smoother with panning from character to character. Good to see Paul Rudd and Hawk eye side lined for family that makes sense. All of this I picked up on my first watch and loved it all. However rewatching this two years later I had forgotten how good it actually was. This movie has a lot of rewatch ability. Some people are anti superhero movies but these last films are a different breed and a must watch.", "This movie was so epic and got my heart pumping throughout the movie. This movie is about the villain, Thanos, trying to snap half of the population off of the face of the planet. It tells a great story with great acting and actors. As always, Robert Downy Jr. was great and so was Tom Holland. The movie seemed to build up on Tony Stark's and Tom Holland's relationship. Overall, wonderful movie with great acting!", "It is a great movie and one of the best in the ucm is next to endgame they are my favorites I almost cry in the cinema for this movie and thanos is wonderful", "Been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty.", "The movie is very good, all the praise for the actors, and for everyone who made this movie, I like it a lot", "Avengers infinity war is one of most epic comic book films ever made and it is huge in every way possible,starting with cast,epic battles and showdowns between heroes and villains,some great quotes and music and direction that was able to follow this massive story and stracture with great success,russo brothers were able to make a film that everyone thought it was impossible to made but they were somehow able to pull it of,thanos is one of best villains of recent years or he is maybe even best villain of decade,in short infinity war is epic film in every way,there is some staff that didnt work for me like some humour and black order was wasted for me,but the rest was incredible to watch and witness", "Basically it's the Best movie I have ever seen, it is also the Greatest Cinematic Experience I have been a part of, and it has the best Villain I have ever witnessed. Nothing I have seen in a Cinema has been remotely close to this experience. This is the Apex of Marvel. Pieces of this Masterpiece: \u00b0 Thanos is the best villain that was ever written. He has hunger and drive, he radiates power, he is a deep philosopher and he also has emotional depth to his character. He had a task to undertake and after, he just wanted to sit down and watch the sunset when he had accomplished the mission. \u00b0 The Movie really makes the Audience use their brains. And it begs the question Is Thanos right? \u00b0 The going from one planet to the next and exploring the galaxy thorough cinematic means gives the movie a Swift and Compelling feel to it. \u00b0 When the huge Ring Ship enters the Earth, you could feel the stakes and notches went up by 2. \u00b0 The Entire Movie Felt like a Major World Event \u00b0 You could really feel the stakes at hand for the Avengers since the Hulk is removed from the equation. \u00b0 There is a specific battle that is made really well. The sounds in that battle were terrific. It was Very very Good. \u00b0 The 'Did you do it' scene really tugged at the heart strings. It was powerful. \u00b0 The Demonstration of Each of the Infinity Stones were Great \ud83d\udc4d \u00b0 The Audience I was with actually felt the snap. I heard the gasps in the Audience. \u00b0 The Ending was Absolute Perfection I don't think I will witness anything like This for quite some time. I think only when Galactus himself appears, I would get the same feeling or perhaps of an even greater Magnitude than I had with Infinity War. Infinity War is a Masterwork. It is Marvels Magnum Opus and it cannot be repeated. I am just Joyful that I got to Witness it. \ud83d\udc4f", "Despite my contribution to the box office of this movie, I still can't believe it can actually rank 60 on the TOP250 list. Perhaps not all superhero movies end in the same way, this big villain finally won. Well, in fact, I think Thanos is very environmentally friendly. You think about it, because there are too many people, resources are limited, and the distribution is uneven, so he considers erasing part of the population randomly to achieve an even distribution of resources. The destruction of Tynos is random, you know, he is so equal hahaha", "Avengers Infinity War what's the best are the Avengers that I've seen today 8 I enjoyed it thoroughly a highly recommended all the action and drama and all the characters were really good", "This film is amazing! The story follows Thanos on his quest to find all the INFINITY STONES and wipe out half of all life. The Avengers have to regroup to fight Thanos and the biggest army in the UNIVERSE and stop him completing his goal. Thanos wins however, and we see the effects of his doings. Even the Avengers have great loses within their group.... I tried not to give too much away but that is the basic plot of the story. Definitely go and see this film!!!!", "Obviously, in the canon of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Endgame is the culmination of a 10-year long buildup to the biggest intertwining story-line in the history of cinema. But to me, Infinity War is. Sure, Endgame has the Superheroes winning as most comic book films do, but Infinity War changes that formula masterfully and that's why I think Infinity War is head and shoulders above Endgame. Endgame has lot of fan-service and ending all the plot revelations that Infinity War (and the films before) started, but with Infinity War, there isn't as much fan-service and if there is, it serves a purpose that furthers the plot wonderfully. The plot twist of having Thanos actually achieve his goal and destroy half of all life is perfectly executed and gives the end of the film the unexpected and solemn ending that it deserves. Everything about this film is done so well that and I think it may be the MCU's best film to date and for the foreseeable future.", "Directed by Anthony Russo & Joe Russo. Starring Josh Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Zoe Saldana, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Scarlett Johannson, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, (voice) Bradley Cooper. (PG-13) The first half of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's grand smackdown finds cosmic supervillain Thanos (Brolin) collecting infinity stones to give himself the ultimate power to wipe out half of the intelligent life in the universe. Depicting the efforts of some fifty or more characters across several storylines in both outer space and on Earth, this exhausting \"event movie\" is so relentless yet dramatically diffuse that it's difficult to engage with anything besides individual moments: a snappy quip here, a brief break from the fever pitch for reflection there. Requiring the absorption of about a dozen-and-a-half prior movies to be able to clearly follow what's happening, the effort lacks proper isolation, resulting in what feels like an incomplete film (and experience); it even opens with a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and ends on a cliffhanger. Despite two-and-a-half hours of action, most of the cast get only a few minutes of screen time to leave a mark (even major players from previous films, like Chadwick Boseman and Don Cheadle, don't manage much more than glorified cameos), but Brolin does manage to create a formidable yet conflicted--even humanized--enemy, which only makes his decisions more startling to behold. Has all the fingerprints of filmmaking-by-committee, but it should still satisfy most fans to at least some degree. 64/100", "I enjoyed watching this movie, it was so great, amazing", "Watched it at least 6 times now. Its sooo good. Just job well done", "This movie keeps you on your toes the whole time and is a very emotional roller coaster. loved it.", "One of the best things i've ever watched, action scenes were top notch, script was funny, thanos was voiced absolutely excellently\none of my favourite films ever", "Avengers: Infinity War is not a perfect movie, its not even a perfect superheroe movie... however there's no denying that balancing soo many characters in one movie is simply amazing! Almost all characters get to shine, Thanos is a brilliant villain with real emotions and motivations. The cgi and directing were great and the ending was amazing! Acting is solid as well but Tom Holland steals the show, especially towards the end of the movie! Only complaints i have are: very mediocre score, the Black Order was incredibly overhyped and all in all very disappointing, Banner not changing into the Hulk was ok from a certain standpoint and made narrative sense but it was preety disappointing, the battle of Wakanda wasn't as good as its Titan counterpart and Shuri is in this, I'm sorry but her character is so awful and annoying that i consider her mere existence to be a flaw. Anyways its only natural that a movie trying to balance 20 something different characters has a few flaws. It's funny (most jokes surprisingly enough land), atmospheric, it is not afraid to take risks, it brings out the best of most characters, it features a great villain and it's all in all better than it ever had the right to be! This movie gets an 8.5/10 from me (might have been a 9 if they didn't make Shuri outsmart Banner).", "The russo brothers have made a fantastic movie with successful humor, with nice fight scenes and this scene with thor arriving in wakanda with his new hammer,killing many of the thanos army and after a few seconds he said \"bring me thanos\" this scene was forgiving and the best hero entrance in mcu. Excuse me for my awful English but I'm from Cyprus and don't know good English\nThanks!!!", "I love this! I like the plot, the actions, the casts. When I watched this one, I was expecting something big, spectacular as the closing of Avanger series. Unfortunately when Endgame was released (I queued on line and got uncomfy seat in the cinema because so many people wanted to see it), I disappointed with that.\nNow, I'm remembering this film and comparing it with previous Avenger series, if I can give score and review this, I'll put rate 9 for this one and 6 for Endgame. I still remember the actions and storyline in Infinity Stone, but all I can remember about Endgame is just about the first 30 minutes in boring conversation film.", "This has it all and is head and shoulders above Endgame or any other Marvel movie. Action from minute 1, great set pieces, humour, best MCU villain of all time and what an ending, was genuinely shocked and moved even tho I had read the comics and kind of knew what would happen. Nothing much more to write, great movie", "This is not one of the best superhero movies for me, probably because I'm not a big fan of putting so many characters from the \"universe\" in one movie, be that dc or marvel. After getting over myself and the fact that spiderman is in space... I watched it for what it was, a fun special effects action movie of good vs evil. It is definately evil they are fighting... A little long perhaps, but cramming all of the characters in here from avengers, guardians of the galaxy and so on, then it has to be. It's a fun ride and worth a watch. Whilst a good stand alone movie, it does set you up for part two, even referring to \"End Game\". So despite its flaws I'll certainly watch Endgame.", "This is Movie that lead to Avengers Endgame! It was beautifully shot and great story to tell!!! ALL AROUND AMAZING CAST AND VOICES!!!!", "In this action packed build up to Endgame, I must say that Infinity War is one of the greatest juggernauts of a super hero movie! It's laden with humor, action, sadness and jaw dropping special effects!", "This movie includes funny moments, major loss and crossovers that gives goosebumps. There are a lot of characters in this movie but all of them has a true meaning in this movie. The past Marvel movies (Guardians of the Galaxy, Black panther etc.) has lead to this point. I have watched this movie more than three times and every time it still gets me. Good music, good actors, memorable scenes.", "I think Avengers: Infinity War was the best movie of all time especially when the villian wins in there days we can not find a movie like this.", "This Movie was good because it was all the movies from the last few years leading up to this,the final one was endgame but this was the cause for why they are desperate to kill thanos and not let him take all the stones . They're all in seperate places,some on earth others in a different planet trying to fight him but they weren't able to take all the stones and at the end most of the people disappear into dust. All the actors played their rolls really well. The theme of the film was really good because Iron man fought the man who who has kept sending people his way to attack him and the city.", "'Avengers : Infinity War' proves to be the best example of a cinematic culmination. The apex of 10-year storytelling delivers all we expected. It's a rare experience and has to been seen in 3D. Featuring 30 characters in just 2.5 hours sounds a bit complex and intricate, but I would say that the Russo Brothers have nailed the film. Watching all our favourite characters of the MCU in one film is just perfect and undoubtedly the most satisying part of the film. This film sets a new standard for the MCU. The team-up of Doctor Strange and Iron Man is hilarious and puts a huge smile on my face. But the most exciting team-up is that of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. The biggest strength of the film lies in the Russo Brothers' ability to combine different storylines and franchises and form a riveting culmination. Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos manages to live up to what we expected. The plot twists involved in this film are unpredictable. You'd never see them coming. The characterization absolutely hits the mark and is well-planned and satisfying. The CGI and the action sequences stand out. The climax is jaw-dropping and epic and leaves you excited for the future events. Overall, 'Avengers: Infinity War' has achieved a significant position in the MCU and manages to live up to the hype.", "This is the best superhero movie.\nBut not a masterpiece.", "This movie is colorful, entertaining and sometimes funny but I really don't understand why it is getting so good reviews. Firstly, the bad guy has no charisma since he's just another pile of polygons without true facial expression. His cruaulty is absurd and his true purpose is elusive. This is a really boring character. The visual effects fills 98% of the movie but it's still just above average. For example, the iron Man and Spiderman bodies are fake and disturbing with their faces floating on it. Too much visual effects kills the visual effects.\nFinally, this outbidding of characters is really exhausting. They all fly like a pierced balloon and shoot ineffective missiles for 2 hours. This isn't a movie, this is a parade.", "The story is simple and even thin, but it's not quite shallow. It covers a lot, but can be summed up quite briefly. It is mostly about action and tragedy. Like many of the Marvel movies following the Avenger story-line, it is full of cold blooded killing on a grand scale and this movie adds torture. Thanos is developed to appear that he is not sadistic. Instead he is insane and his motivation makes no sense. The film develops the appearance that he is thoughtful and self-sacrificial. To me this concept is insincere, even irreverent. This movie is like so many other Marvel movies in that it is full of absolutely invincible villains. They control everything around them with a wave of their hands. It is magic with no limitations. And in this movie, it's not just Thanos, but some of his minions as well. For so much of the early part of the movie, it had the feel of video name-dropping. Many of the Marvel movie characters are introduced one after another without dwelling on any. We see perhaps the most romance of any of the movies where several couples have moments of affection. For me the humor is stiff and inappropriate, not in a obscene or crude way, but the transitions between drama and tragedy vs comedy is clumsy, almost as if the comedy is it's filling a quota. At first the tragedy is heart-rending, but then tragedy follows tragedy and then it becomes a flood and the impact is negated. The viewer has to strongly suspect that something is going to reverse it all and looking at the cast for Endgame seems to verify that thinking. (But I am guess since I haven't yet seen Endgame.) I really dislike movies that end with defeat when you know that it is not the final outcome. It's half a story. A cliffhanger in the credits is one thing. A story has been completed and there is a teaser for the next one. But I don't like half a story when I've paid for a full movie and I know the completion may be a year or two away. (No, I don't like TV season finales that hang either.) Despite my complaints, some of which are personal preference, I recognize that this movie is highly successful in telling the story it intended.", "This film is super great. Before you watch it you have to watch Thor: Ragnarok But once you've seen that you're good to know. Hope to watch how everything turns out in Endgame after this roller coaster of a blockbuster", "It is great. Thanos is great. But ironman may be too powerful.", "I was blown away by this. And i wasn't even a fan of the other mcu movies, to say the least. However the pace of IW will almost literally leave you breathless for about 2.5 hrs - it's that good. Speaking of pace, Endgame was so badly paced that i could only give it a 1/10. It was an utter disappointment and not an action movie, that me and probably million viewers around the world were expecting after IW. Anywho, IW is by far the best action flick I've watched in years and i probably will re-watch it at least a dozen times in the years to come. 10/10.", "With all the characters coming together and a big bad to fight, this MCU movie has to be at the top 5 of most people's lists! Everything that fans wanted from Marvel's movies you will get from this! This has to have one of the biggest movie casts in cinematic history. Over 30 superheroes coming together for one big story, a part one of the culmination of the entire MCU. The ending has to be one of the most shocking endings I have ever seen in a movie. With the snap of Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet, half of the Avengers cast disappears including Spider-Man in a scene that was improvised by Tom Holland himself, now that is dedication! There is a lot to get out of this, the pacing is good, the interaction between all the characters is superb, fantastic music and performances especially from Josh Brolin as the mad titan Thanos. Everything in this film works and Marvel have worked a long ten years to get to this movie. That is a really long time since the first Iron Man movie and that is quite an achievement, hopefully they don't slip up anytime soon.", "This is without a doubt the best MCU movie ever made!

Eventually, we're going to run out of resources on Earth. It may take a few hundreds or thousands of years. This will mark the end of humanity, if we don't kill each other first. That is the problem facing the human condition. Thanos has a solution for that. Obviously, it is an evil one. But, I can't fault the guy for trying. Coming to the movie, it is a fast paced, well structured one. Can't wait to watch the Endgame now.", "Avengers: Infinity War is the 19th movie and also one of the most popular movie of the MCU.

It was the movie that celebrated 10 years of the MCU and it turned out to be really successful.\nAfter Civil War, the group of heroes were separated. Thanos (John Brolin) came to Earth to collect 6 powerful Infinity Stones and his goal was to wipe half of the universe. The Avengers teamed up to fight Thanos and bring peace to the universe.\nAvengers: Infinity War is a really good idea to celebrate 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, full of entertainment and a lot of fun actually. The film was really dark with Thanos successfully accomplished his goal and wiped half of the universe, including some of our beloved heroes like Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Vision,... The music score was also dark from the beginning when Thanos and his children terrorized Asgard and killed Heimdall and Loki, I could see the dark theme which was really suitable. The end was really epic and tragic as well. I loved the CGI and the battle was really awesome even though they didn't win.\nThe movie was one of the most tragic, epic and darkest superhero movies I've ever seen...until Avengers: Endgame.\nIt was not a waste of time to make this as a celebration of 10 years.

It's amazing. The visual effects are stunning. The villain of this particular movie is what makes this movie fantastic.", "If you're a superhero-fan, you don't need a review, you will have seen this anyways. For people without this disposition, Infinity Wars is a harder sell. Best working are the characters. Even though there is an army of support characters, not one feels really cheap and unnecessary. It's a party and as such it feels a little claustrophobic sometimes, but it's still fun. The story though is a superhero-quagmire. Especially after about half of the movie logic went fully overboard and the plot happens via incomprehensible superhero actions. Time is irrelevant, distances are extremely liquid and neither the MacGuffin nor the relationships of the different \"superhero abilities\" is ever satisfyingly explained. As such drama happens predomantly in the faces of the actors. Visual fidelity distracts from all questions starting with \"why\". It's like you're watching a sport you don't know the rules of - Who is winning? Why was that action helpful? Why is everyone cheering? If you're new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don't start here. The movie strongly presents itself as a chapter of an epic, so you're expected to have a certain idea of the characters to begin with and you won't see real closure unless you plan to visit the next Avenger iteration. And to be honest, i'm not sure this episode warrants the investment, as i had little enthusiasm or emotions for the protagonists and was left observing the spectacle. The humor and the actors save it from becoming another Transformer, but i never felt really engaged.", "This is easily my favourite film of all time, not one negative! I'm a huge fan of the marvel universe but this is different level! So much so, I thought it was better than endgame!", "Another hit by Marvel assembling the Avengers against one of the most intimidating movie villains in history - Thanos. It took them over 20 movies to get to their most defying antagonist and the wait was worth it. Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos truly stands out among a sea of Hollywood A-listers portraying characters that became iconic. The movie is a action packed thrill ride from the opening until the shocking ending and it keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole run-time. A must watch and one of the cultural phenomenons of modern cinema which will be remembered and re-watched by generations to come.", "This movie is everything I wanted to be and the cliffhanger in the end where the bad guy winning made me want to watch the next", "(Flash Review) I feel like Marvel managed to get each character into this movie; as far as I could tell. They all team up to halt Thanos from collecting all six colorful Infinity Stones. Once he possesses them all, which fit nicely into a stylish metal glove, he will force the universe fit his personal will. Which is the destroy have the population of the entire universe as he feels overpopulation is a problem. That of course is a contrast to all the people who live in the universe. Aren't there better solutions!? So the Avengers team up to battle him without much success. Thanos is able to thwart each special power thrown at him. Can Thanos be stopped or will the expected happy ending come through? This movie was full of comprehendible action, dazzling effects, solid humor and some somber moments. Not being a superhero guru, I'm sure many insider points flew past me as there were so many superheroes, the action felt a bit scattered about but I got what I expected from it and to the MAX.", "I am a big Marvel fan and this movie is just so fascinating for me. I am amazed how CGI has progressed for all these years. I'll try to write this review with as little spoilers as I can so let's go.\nWhat I particularly was the beginning of the movie. The beginning of \"Infinity War\" is so dark and the start is so shocking and just unbelievable for me to process everything so fast. The scenes are so unpredictable and it left me open-mouthed for the rest of the movie. The dark blue color prevails over every single scene and the actors did their job so perfectly.\nLater in the movie, the colors start changing, from blue to red, to rainbow-ish and dark ones again. The scenes start changing quickly as the fight scenes start appearing and it is just not explainable how I felt while watching. The background music is just perfect. Alan Silvestri may be one of the best composers and I am so proud of what he did on the movie.\nThe ending just left me speechless as it may have left you, those are some heavy scenes for viewers and the whole cinema was basically sniffing and some were even crying. To conclude, the movie has a great number of funny scenes and I would definitely recommend it for every single movie lover.", "It will not be better than that ... awesome.\nThe best movie I've ever seen", "This movie is my most anticipated movie for 3 years, and when I sit on the cinema, it feels like this is the time that I wait for a long time. And when I came out from the cinema, I feel like I want to watch this movie for a thousand times. And what's the best in this movie is the visual effects. I'm really proud the Industial light&Magic, Weta Digital, CineSite, Framestore, Digital Domain, and more... This movie deserve the best visual effects awards", "The best avengers movie till date. Watch it now unmissable action and humor at the same time", "Thats why she was never around in the current Avengers movies.. And also.. Why her beacon is a 90s era pager.. Haha sorry I'm slow..

I didn't see the ending coming!", "Great movie but I expect better.\nI didn't quite understand the 'INFINITY STONES' powers. I hope we could see more of it's use on Part 2.", "To be honest a lot of what I want to say is already said by other but one thing i like to add . I loved thanos he has reasons and motivation so few villains do but so much wrong in this story so many characters dead without any good reason so many stories not told because they want to fit 20 characters in one movie i think it would have been good movie if the movie is 5 hours long but i didn't enjoy this at all . And stop the pathos (cheap comedy)", "This movie is just perfect, all the drama, the action, the visual effects, the story, was amazing see all the heroes together, Thanos is the best villain and this is it.

The film has such a great pacing that I never get bored. Are there thing's missing yeahh I was kinda dissapointed that a few battles are missing, but I can't dismiss what we did get for what we didn't get it as the action is still astonishing. We finally get to see the MCU come together with characters meeting and using their powers together against a familiar foe. It has an amazing soundtrack and visuals and is not afraid to keep the focus where it belongs instead of trying to give everybody equal screen time and the ending is incredible. Totally ready for End Game.\nI felt the need to write this review as there as so many negative reviews on here its crazy do these people have no sense of wonder or are they just bashing Marvel cause they can't stand there success? The best film in the MCU and promises more greatness in the future. Screw the haters.", "I feel very exited to watch this movie,they can give me\na good mood,that's enough!bless the world!", "I love this movie, even though I know the endings are always leading to peace, love, and heroism, I can't help but side with the villain in this movie. I do believe his theory is correct. This world is overpopulated and needs a way over due cleansing.\nTeam Thanos!!!!", "As a likely minority in the over-rated super-hero extravaganza, Infinity War as a standalone movie was a disappointment. It pandered to the audience with simple script devices where the superheroes were made to look pretty stupid, uncertainly un-Jason Bourne like in mentality and behavior. The evil ones were able to convenient arrive just in time to continue the storyline that could have easily ended multiple number of times at any number of points if these multitude of conglomerate, almost innumerable superheroes could actually learn to work together and obtain the oneness that comes of Buddhist, Eastern cultural wisdom of the importance of society over the individual. The backstory of Thanos and his daughter was too brief and insufficient to provide a more complex and bonded emotional connection is one problem. And another problem is simply too many superheroes that almost makes the movie more about heroes becoming the norm instead of super. It's almost now about many people who appear to be super but the movie is populated with so many of them that really it seems that they are normal people with extraordinary differences that the audience has seen so often that they almost appear normal now, nothing really special anymore, something the audience just comes to expect. Overall, the movie substantively is pretty superficial and the plot while challenging includes too many cliques and uneven tone from a chaotic fusion of trying to be so cute and funny, to serious and emotional riveting so much so that it becomes neither.", "Just having all these characters in one movie together makes for a great movie. With the large cast you are always going to run into the problem of the movie being cluttered. The crew did a great job balancing it and it only ever hurts the movie when we return to one story line then I realize that we had been away from them for a while. The build up is well of 10 years really pays off except that it seems that the tension and the build up had died down after civil war. This is not really a problem with the movie its self, but going forward we already have movies announced for \"dead\" characters. And from the moment I watched it for the first time I can agree that it will be undone. Upon re watch there was ) emotional weight to that scene when there should be. When it is most likely undone in the next movie it will be making that scene almost pointless. Though it is a great movie that lived up to the hype they had the story lines from other movies continued through other movies. The action was great and almost everything else. Thanos is a great villain who does succeed and is a well crafted character. This is a great movie and I think my biggest problem with it is that they set it up to have more ways to mess it up in Endgame.", "Great twist in the end and best movie in the MCU. Thanos looked great and all the characters had something special in the movie.", "The only thing I want to say is that Starlord is the Jar Jar Binks of Marvel Universe. His immaturity caused Thanos to keep the glove and set motion the fall of the universe .", "I've read the original comic book trilogy countless times as a kid and I was trying real hard to keep my expectations low for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be disappointed. But it totally delivered and is a worthy culmination of what Marvel started with the first Iron Man movie.", "Avengers: Infinity War does a good job of taking moving parts from the 18 previous Marvel films and putting them together into one, cohesive machine. Each superhero gets his or her chance to shine, and Thanos holds his own as the antagonist. This movie can't really stand on its own, but is has an epic feel, as well as enough humor & action to keep fans of this cinematic universe entertained.", "Avengers: Infinity War: 9 out of 10: Well after eighteenth or so movie you know the drill. Big Universe killing bad threatens puppies and kittens and our heroes put aside their differences to defeat the big bad and someone dies because the contract negotiations were at a standstill. Yup, I am sure that is what happens. Okay so the opening scene reminds me of Alien 3 but I am sure we are done with indiscriminate killing of beloved characters in brutal ways. (Two and a half hours later) Oh dear god... The Good: This is a hero's journey. The fact that the hero in question is the big bad Thanos makes this a unique Marvel film. While having a big bad on a hero's journey is hardly unknown, it often isn't done this well (I am looking your way Star Wars Prequels). Thanos is a man with a plan. The Avengers are simply obstacles. And for the most part, they play the role of obstacles and setbacks on Thanos' journey. Almost everyone comes to the party (sorry Hawkeye) and it is a blast. Thor meets the Guardians of the Galaxy was a particular treat. I liked the way they managed to reward viewership of the previous eighteen movies or so. Avenger's Infinity War is stuffed with Easter eggs and trivia. In fact, the movie really is amazingly stuffed over a very long runtime. Forget added filler, you actually get the sense they wanted to put in twice as much stuff as they did. The Bad: With truncated participation by the individual Avengers some of them tended to revert to their baseline trope even though they have had growth over the recent films. I liked Thor in this film but he seemed to be more a person who had had a psychotic break than an actual hero. (In fairness this is called out in the film by the rabbit... sorry raccoon.) Starlord as well seems to have lost two films worth of character development in many of his scenes. He also got chubby (also called out in the film by the rabbit). There is also some flotsam left over from the Civil War film that needed to handwaved better than it was. Overall though a great job bringing such a large cast together. Is it bad form to wish that the Silver Surfer was in this film. Don't get me wrong I am not a fan of the character per se. But if you have a Thanos film you need a Silver Surfer. \nThe Ugly: Bruce Banner in the Iron Man Hulkbuster armor just never looked right. He looks like a Goomba had escaped from the set of the old Super Mario Brothers movie. \nIn Conclusion: You know I got some flack from reviewing the original X-men movies when I pointed out that Magneto had a good point. I am not saying Thanos is right mind you but the movie does make a compelling case. If it was just humans I think I could get behind it but since it includes kittens I am morally opposed. A really good film from a series that has not lacked for great films.", "This movie is a perfect example of executing of all built formulas for 10 years and 18 movies till Ragnarok. If this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 rating then other superhero movies would have deserve 1/10, not because of they are bad, but to make a clear difference between infinity war and other superhero movies.\nThe delivery of the movie was better than a marvel fan expections. You just can't put your eyes from the movie for 2:30 hours.\nInfinity war is not only a complete package of actions, but also a mixture of fun, joy, emotions and heart breaking incidents.\nWhoever didn't watch the movie I will suggest them to watch it but only after watching the previous movies otherwise he/she will not get the same taste.", "Hi I love this movie \ud83c\udf7f i love the movie I looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove!!!!", "The result of 10 years of work is wonderful, film with good moments.\nComedy at the right time Many sad moments are also present, in my opinion the best film with super heroes", "With 10 years of build to one movie people thought is was going to be horrible but they were wrong is movie is amazing it feels like the end not just another movie. it does the best that it could do giving each different character. and the end the end is the best finishes to a film i have ever seen this is a great ending this feels like the villain they were building up has a personality so when he wins you feel a bunch of mixed emotions", "Those people who were thinking this movie underrated is an actual childish.

It took 10 years to get the setup for this movie. I had been waiting for the Infinity War for so long. I just have to say that it was amazing and definitely worth the wait! As most of you know, the movie is about almost literally everyone in the MCU teaming together to fight Thanos so he doesn't collect all of the Infinity Stones and destroy half of the universe. I'm not going to talk much about anyone else but Thanos since everybody did superb and knows about their character. Josh Brolin as the lead villain was amazing. He is the best Marvel villain ever made. Thanos has a good reason for what he's doing rather than other villains that are bad and beat up guys. The film delved deep into his mind so we can understand him. We love him so much but as a villain we hate what he does. Every time Thanos is on the screen we can all feel tension and fear. We're not like \"Oh he's here to do something bad.\" It's like we panic a little because we don't know what he'll do and we're scared for what he's going to do. Thanos also has emotion and he isn't just a tough guy. That's all I'm going to say about him. The heroes were all great. It's not like the other Avengers movies where they team up to stop a bad person. They're teaming up in desperation because they don't know how they should approach the problem. They know if they don't stop him, basically everyone will die. It was a very serious and darker movie for the MCU. There were some greatly timed jokes, like usual, so we could breathe rather than hold our breath praying for a miracle to happen. Now on to the technical stuff. The effects for the movie were fantastic. Most of the movie relied on them. There were a minimal amount of times where you could tell it was fake, but I don't consider that a flaw. The cinematography was pretty good too. For an action movie there wasn't too much shaky cam but more on wide shots. The Russo Brothers did amazing with directing, as they did with Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Civil War. They understood all of the characters and motives. The movie did jump around a lot which some people didn't like but there was a lot happening so it was necessary. I had no flaws with this movie. It was absolutely amazing and had everything that a Marvel movie should have. I would definitely see it. You will not be disappointed in how great it is.\nMy Grade: A+ (The cliffhanger at the end was fantastic)", "After almost 3 hours in the theater.\nAnd i still got out disappointed.\nThe action scenes were amazing.\nBut something was missing.\nToo much was going, too many planets.\nAll in all, The 1st 2 movies were way better", "10 Years, 18 Films. Marvel has set a staple for the super hero genre and Avengers: Infinity War is no exception. Avengers: Infinity War, follows Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his quest to assemble the infinity gantlet to destroy half of a life throughout the universe as a fractured team of avengers, race to stop him. The characters are superb, the dynamic that each character brings to the table is fascinating and enjoyable, Marvel has taken a universe that they have been expanding on for the past 10 years and throws it on it's head. First time viewing this movie, I was on the edge of my seat and the second viewing was just as enjoyable being able to take in all the little details of the film. Well done to the Russo Brothers, the Actors and the Crew for making a cinematic event that lived up to my expectations. I highly recommend Avengers: Infinity War for any comic book fan, and super hero fan.", "The reason why it's only 9/10 is because so many of my favourite marvel characters died.

It felt like we have been waiting for it for years (or even since it was first announced). Josh Brolin does a fantastic job voicing Thanos.

Not as funny as Thor: Ragnarok's jokes, but still can be found funny.  WARNING SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!\n---------------\nSo. About the funny line: Drax makes up this joke and here how it goes: Tony, Parker, and Strange meet the GOTG, Quill says \"where is gamora?\" then Tony says \"ill do you one better WHO is gamora?\" then drax says \"WHY IS GAMORA!!\" And about the whole preventing thanos from getting all 6 infinity stones, you would probably think: \"its marvel. the heroes always win\". But you guessed wrong because thanos ACTUALLY gets all 6 stones and he snaps his fingers. Causing half the universe to die. Here are the people who are known to die: Bucky, Black Panther, Falcon, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, Nick Fury, Maria Hill. Those are the people who die from the snap. Now finally, here are the people who DONT die from the snap: Heidmall, Loki, Vision, and Gamora.

Some of the scenes will even bring tears to the younger or more sensitive viewers. This movie's ending is awesome, yet it still leaves you wanting for more. If you love any of these heroes your in luck. You must watch the movie for it is absolutely awesome.", "A decade's worth of intertwined superhero adventures culminates in one staggering, towering behemoth of a film. It sounds like a tall order - and, clearly, it is - but Marvel's been doing this for quite a while now and seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials. Effectively juggling so many competing stars, flavors, themes and aesthetics was my largest concern, especially ones as disparate as Captain America and the Guardians of the Galaxy, but obviously this was a core focus for Infinity War's producers. Not only does each scene retain the characteristic tone and identity of its unique featured franchise, it also mixes fluidly with those of another, creating a fresh blend that works almost effortlessly and moves in exciting new directions. This is the essence of the Marvel universe, particularly so from a long-term reader's perspective, and it's something I've yet to grow tired of seeing on the big screen. Creating a great cast is step one, but watching them grow and interact with the unfamiliar is where the real magic happens. Each subsequent installment in the Avengers franchise ups that ante just a little bit further. No doubt, I would've been content to just watch these familiar faces bounce around in the same enclosed space, trading zingers and butting heads, but there's an underlying reason for all this, and the film (somehow) doesn't shortchange that, either. Thanos, the big wrinkle-chinned monster who's been hinted at and referenced for years, has finally come to town with a destructive cause in mind. Well-rounded villains have not been a strength for the MCU thus far, but in this case they make amends. Thanos is quickly and efficiently established as a galactic-level threat, far and away the most powerful creature we've seen so far, and then thoroughly fleshed out as a fully-realized three dimensional character. We may not agree with his means, but his motivation is certainly understandable. That's a new thing, a clearly addressed criticism, and it makes the film far stronger. So, yes, I enjoyed myself. The new Avengers is a big deal, it takes big risks, and judging from the box office numbers, it's reaped big rewards. There are also several little flaws for those interested in picking. Most glaringly, it falls into the trap of being merely half a movie. After the better part of three hours, I left the theater with the feeling I'd just binge-watched an entire season of an expensive TV series and been left hanging with a \"tune in next time.\" Its story is obviously incomplete, and while that's played for maximum effect in the stunning conclusion (the first time I've ever seen an entire theater sit through a credit roll in complete silence), that stuck in my craw. My other complaints can be largely brushed away as inconsequential - inexplicably missing characters, too many guest spots, a not-insignificant barrier of entry - but that's a relatively big one and something that I keep revisiting. Having cleared my chest of that, though, I'll strongly recommend it as a fundamental bit of summer blockbuster history, even if it isn't quite summer yet. Potential viewers should already know what to expect (Infinity War is just another refinement in the well-worn Marvel formula) and whether or not that's remotely up their alley. If so, by all means, go see it more than once. This is the best entry yet. And maybe, just maybe, it'll shine even more brightly as a Lord of the Rings style all-day anthology. Once the story is actually complete, that is.", "Infinity War doesn't differ from other Marvel production. Dialogues and jokes are sometimes good (e.g. Thor meeting Guardians), sometimes really cheap (Thanos + Gamora + Soul stone). The characters don't surprise, but the team interaction is still great to look on. Unfortunately, story jumps from place to place across the universe, some characters disappear from the story for so long that you almost forget them. On the other hand, having 20 characters in one place would be likely even more unbearable. Unlike in previous two Avengers, where it took an hour before things started moving, Infinity War is agressive from first to last scene.  The biggest star is clearly Josh Brolin and his Thanos. Compared to previous villains, Thanos gets a lot more screentime, so his character and motivations make sense and it's easier to symphatize with him (to some extent). He's a bulldozer, smashing all superheroes like flies, without anything/anyone being able to stop him. The movie ending serves, of course, just as a spectacular effect. The feeling of hopelessness and fear from Thanos is pretty well transfered upon the viewer.  Infinity War doesn't show anything new. It's not easy to entertain with the same thing over and over again but Marvel did it. Despite having 10-15 main characters it still holds together and doesn't feel like some confused mash-up (ehm, Justice League, ehm). Bravo Marvel, bravo.", "Marvel / Disney nunca har\u00e1 una pel\u00edcula que pueda considerarse una obra maestra, esta fue la oportunidad, The Avengers tambi\u00e9n lo fue, y hay un par m\u00e1s que son claramente excepcionales (The Winter Soldier y Guardians of the Galaxy), pero a este ritmo, nunca lo har\u00e1n.

Marvel started something magical and hyped it up to this point and did not disapoint. I read some reviews about the holes in the plot and et cetera and all i wanted to say was wtf are you talking about. These people probably didn't even watch a single marvel movie let alone a mcu movie. Let me tell you this: this movie has a plot as long as 18 movies. It's all scattered around the mcu movies. Seein the thing we have been expecting for a decade was the reward. Infinity War is great as a standalone movie but it's rewarding and more sensible if you watch other mcu movies. It's funny, action packed, emotional and heroic. It makes sometimes makes you cry out of laughing and sometimes out of sadness. I suggest you watch other mcu movies before seeing this movie and you will hype like a dog who has seen his owner ;).", "A Marvel fan would love this film, action packed, and enjoyable plot.\nHowever, if your not a marvel fan or watched it in a while you will have to catch of with some of the most recent films however avoid if you don't like marvel films as it will only be a jumble of nonsense.", "Infinity War was a spectacle of a film, I really don't know what to say as a big Marvel/DC fanboy, The film does kind of open a little clunky so I thought that was a little flaw. But to all this wait, it was worth it. The action sequences were non stop and the film didn't let me breathe from start to finish which I felt exhilarated as of seeing everyone reunite together for 10 years and that's what this film gave me. It does a solid job on it's performances with a big cast and it's so amazing to see them on screen again. The humor was hilarious and I love the way Marvel makes their jokes so memorable and it did deliver that. Thanos was a masterpiece as the villain or is he a villian? His CGI was great but by the last act it's quite noticeable, Either way, he was so great in this film, his motivation is so great it felt intimidating every time he appeared on screen and is a touching character at times and I love the way the Russo Bros really gave him a backstory that expresses the character more. The Black Order was ehhhhh idk but Ebony Maw was the one I felt more a character in him and was cool. CGI was overused alot with a big budget and it was great. The ending was a bit contreversal and shocking and will leave audiences heartbroken in which I thought was a very well executed scene that you feel tension once it happens. Overall, Avengers infinity War was a masterpiece of a film, if you go into this film with an empty brain with no idea about how it leads to this then this is not a film you'll be surprised if don't watch the previous MCU movies, the action sequences were so enjoyable, the humor was hilarious I only thought a very few didn't land and is a pretty unexpected and emotional film that hits you hard and I am totally speechless about this film 10/10", "I'm a huge marvel fan , but in this movie I didn't feel the tension although it's a important war , firstly the acting of some actors wasn't on point , secondly I feel like some important heroes weren't given enough screen time as others, also the script was smart but made the characters more neglecting to the gravity of the threat facing them and just joking around by increasing the humor and decreasing the seriousness, last but not least the movie seemed in a hurry from my personal view . In the end I can't say I didn't enjoy it , it one of the best MCU movies out there , it gave us a great antagonist not like all the others , good in every way not just the CGI that made him look complete and great but also the acting of the actor and the reflections of the character, and it gave us the opportunity to see our heroes united for the same cause .(this was my personal opinion of the movie and I am exited to see what the second part has to show us !)", "Breakdown of Infinity War: 1. Token action scene.\n2. Fun contrasting character mash up.\n3. Overlong dialogue explaining the complex technicalities of the plot.\n4. Thanos makes a character decide between giving up their infinity stone or seeing a loved one die. (so original, right?)\n5. Repeat steps one through four, until Thanos has all 6 stones.\n6. Cool cliffhanger ending. The Action, aside from the scenes with Thor, is easily forgettable.  The character team ups are fun but not nearly as fun as they could or should have been as there's too many moving parts to give any of the scenes a moment to breathe and let the characters simply banter with each other. This is mostly due to- The characters constantly having to explain the plot to each other when they team up which totally kills the fun of mashing the characters up in the first place. The only stakes in this movie are \"do this or die, or, if not you, your loved one will die\", which is fine to do once in a film but the writers fall back on this dramatic gimmick time and time again and cling onto it until the bitter end. Did I mention earlier that this movie was repetitive? Because yeah it's repetitive. Aside from all that, the ending was definitely a surprise and leaves you hungry to know what happens next. And hopefully in part two they will have more breathing room for real character drama and good old fashion avenger's banter. This is what I would call a \"one and done\" type of Marvel movie and feels more like a steppingstone for the story rather than a full-fledged satisfying movie in its own right.", "The movie was what I expected in the way of action and quips of humour. I really liked Captain America's new look too. However what I don't understand is why they used so much CGI for Thor's lieutenants? It felt like going from a game when looking at them to a movie when looking at the Avengers and the rest. The lieutenants were excellent creations in their concepts but I didn't like the final computerized, animated cartoon feeling. It didn't jive with the rest of the movie in this way. The Hulk almost feels this way sometimes but not to the same extent.\nAlso I see lots of opportunities for them to inject changes toward a solution or better outcome in the next film.\nOne more thing - um, instead of trying to remove the guanlet, perhaps just chopping his arm off would be easier?", "You have to give Marvel studios some credit. They have the job of making it the most hyped/ best marvel movie ever. The CGI was ok it wasn't the best, but there was so much pressure on Marvel. This movie was great, sad, but great. The story was well thought up and resembled the comics a ton. The character combinations went very well telling us they are in the same universe which makes the future way more exciting. Making the best movies puts a huge reliability on Marvel, every year people are excited for a new movie and they usual don't disappoint. Watch this movie you won't regret it.", "I must admit, when I first heard the majority of Marvel characters were going to be in this movie, I was unsure, not knowing if it was going to be too much or not. And since seeing this movie, I found I was terribly mistaken. Probably the best marvel movie yet, apart from Spider-Man Homecoming which I cant choose between but I think infinity way is slightly better. And no, it was not too much. Just remember, this isn't DC (who are literally a sinking ship) and marvel haven't made a bad movie since Fantastic 4. It actually worked with a large amount of heros in one place. It was funny, sad, full of action and the story line was spot on. It is such an epic film and when it comes out on blu-ray, I'll watch it that day!  The casting is absolutely brilliant and couldn't have been better. It was so unexpected and the fact that it's taken 19 movies to build up to this one is incredible. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you are a fan of marvel or even if your not, you need to see it. I really shouldn't have doubted it in the slightest because every time I do, I just remember that Fantastic 4 was made years ago now.  Never. Underestimate. Marvel.  SPIDER-MAN WAS AMAZING THO!!!  Tom Holland, Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and Chris Pratt especially. Tom Holland and Robert Downey jr in my mind, were just amazing together. I thought they were really good!", "Infinity war is the last movie of the MCU so far, Russo brothers do not waste any time introducing new characters, from the begining to the end it is full of action.\nIts based on the comic \"Infinity Gauntlet\" but have too many diferences to be consider as a copy.\nA movie that you cant see only once if you are a comic fan.", "Please don't take into consideration these low iq 1/10 reviews, as no matter how the movie was most of these people would still rate it that. Their points are usually vague 'bad storytelling' I see a lot, but I can guarantee you these same people couldn't formulate a comprehensive complaint of why they didn't like the story. All and all a great movie, don't let these butt hurt imbeciles with a predetermined hatred of the MCU dissuade you, because at the end of the day it's one of the highest grossing films of all time and has an 8.9 here for a reason :).", "*SPOILERS*\nMarvel and the Russo Bros have outdone themselves. They took a giant, bald, purple guy with a scrotum for a chin and a magical golden glove the size of a human head and actually made him relatable and interesting. They gave you genuine reasons to empathize with him while simultaneously giving you genuine reasons to hate him. Also, some villains have moments that show they're really cowards at heart, or that they don't have the conviction to actually carry out their goals (such as Magneto in the first X-Men film), but there isn't a hint of that in Thanos. As far as he's concerned, not only is he saving the universe -- it's his destiny to save the universe, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish that goal, even if it kills him, or he loses everything. The Russo bros have said that Thanos is the protagonist of this film, and I saw it that way throughout the movie. I never expected him to be as developed as he was. He's easily the best villain in the entire MCU -- hell, he might be the best villain I've seen in ANY movie in nearly a decade. Thor was probably my favorite character (aside from Thanos himself). I found myself sympathizing with Thor the most out of all the Avengers; this big purple bastard slaughtered half his people and killed his brother right in front of him. Because of Thanos, the struggle Thor went through to save his people from Ragnarok were for nothing. So I wanted to see Thanos achieve his goal, but at the same time, I wanted Thor to get his revenge. The Battle of Titan is without a doubt my favorite action set piece in the entire MCU. You see Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy working together to restrain Thanos and try to remove the Gauntlet, and they very nearly succeed, but not quite. Thanos has his most badass moment during this scene. He decides, \"You've pissed me off, so now I'm gonna hit you with the biggest thing I can find,\" which happens to be a moon. He uses the gauntlet to pulverize the whole thing and rain down asteroids on his opponents.\nIron Man also has his best moment here. Everyone else has been taken out of the fight, and he has to face Thanos alone. He unloads everything he's got on Thanos and actually makes him bleed. Thanos reveals his respect for Tony, whose determination rivals his own. For all its awesomeness, this movie definitely has its problems. I felt that the appearances of a lot of characters like Steve Rogers were totally obligatory, which is a shame, because Steve Rogers is one of my favorites. He does have a couple of cool moments -- such as when he actually tries to fight Thanos -- but it's ultimately unsatisfying. Also, the Battle of Wakanda was another weak point for me. It was all right, but it could've been a lot better. I was frustrated by the terrible, nonsensical battle tactics; when the Outriders were trying to get in behind the defenses, Rogers decides, \"We better keep them in front of us.\" A logical idea would be to create a bottleneck and funnel the enemies through a narrow space and overwhelm them, thus negating the advantage of strength in numbers. But what do they do instead? They leave the barriers wide open and let them come in and SPREAD OUT, and it's only because of Thor's timely arrival that the heroes aren't completely and utterly annihilated.\nThat said, Thor's entrance into Wakanda (like many of his scenes) was very cool. Anyway, I could keep rambling about this movie, but then this review would take eight hours to read, so here's my final verdict. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" isn't perfect by any means, but it is a very good film with perhaps the best cinematic villain in nearly a decade. I saw it three times in cinemas, and I don't regret it for a second. 8/10.", "SPOILER: This is the best AVENGERS film that came out! \nCan't wait to see the next part of this movie!\nThe movie may kill some of my favorite characters when I was little but, the story came out great!", "Not often I leave a cinema almost stunned, but this was one. The film sucked you in and wrenched you, and was then not afraid to give you a kicking too. Well written, with time taken to develop new characters, this has merged the MCU together and I can't wait for the climax. In the meantime, go and see this film!", "I was not going to write a review for this film, but having seen so many negative reviews for this film, I feel it is important to put things in context. You should not watch this movie if you have not seen the other MCU films. There have been reviews stating that this film has no plot and that it is just mindless action. That is basically true. The film cannot stand on its own and it was not meant to. Someone described this film like the season finale of a TV show. The characters and plot of this film have been set up over the course of many other movies. If you come into this film not knowing that, it will seem like a mess to you. However, for those of us who have watched the previous MCU films and grown to love these characters, we do not need a set up. We know where we are and what is at steak.  This movie is the culmination of ten years of storytelling. As the end to a ten year buildup this film is excellent. It is exciting and emotional. It is fun to see different characters interacting with each other. Characters who have never met before are forced together and the results are funny and interesting. At no time during this film was I bored. Many times I was on the edge of my seat wondering how our heroes were going to save the day. I was shocked to see what characters lived and died.  Thanos as the villain of the film was excellent. He was compelling and scary. He is a commanding presence. This film sticks with you after it ends not only because of what happens at the end, but because of the powerful performance of Josh Brolin as Thanos. This is a highly satisfying film for anyone who has followed these characters for so long.", "Comedy and action at equal parts. Grab the biggest bucket of popcorn and your favourite soda and enjoy! Yeah, the plot is meh but as long as you have popcorn in the bucket, why bother... Best thing after Guardians of the Galaxy 2.", "Never, just never say this movie is better than Dark Knight just dont! \nIt is good but not close as good as Dark Knight.", "To review this as a traditional film is a bit of a fallacy, I understand the reasoning but there is an aspect to the MCU that needs to be acknowledged by critics and viewership: These are episodic films. They are essentially a long-episode series. They are not stand-alones. If you have not seen the major releases that play into this title (the Guardians films, Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok) then you will neither understand nor enjoy this film. It's to be expected but I don't think it inherently makes this a weak episode-film. It is among the strongest MCU episode-films. The film itself is one of the few MCU films that has an unconventional edge to it. Its central plot plays through the motives and actions of the villain, with the heroes playing supplementary roles in their various approaches to defeat him. The characters are overall well-written, though there are certain ones that may feel dubious to some viewers (I have seen mixed opinions on the Guardians' portrayal but I enjoyed it.) Thanos himself is interesting and flawed, as well as fun to watch both as an enemy to our characters and as the possible protagonist. His power also appears to be over-the-top but it actually is quite balanced well in the end of the film. McGuffin-hunting may break the film for others, and I can understand that, but the nature of it didn't bother me because I found it handled in an appropriate way. Infinity War is not perfect by any stretch, I contemplated rating it a 7/10 instead of an 8...however I think tit was a very well-executed film with many redeeming qualities, and I hadn't enjoyed a Marvel film to this degree in a long while, and though I agree it's overhyped, I don't believe it should have to fit into the boxes that traditional critics continue to try and push on this episodic film series.", "4 out of 5 stars (one of the best in its series) Avengers: Infinity War is the culmination of the past 10 years of superhero movies within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fans of the franchise will laugh and cry as their favorite heroes go up against the toughest foe they've ever encountered, while non-fans will wonder what all the fuss is about. Essentially, this is a movie for the devotees of this billion-dollar series. If you are not on the Marvel train yet, either engage in a massive binge session to get caught up, or wait until The Incredibles 2 next month for your superhero fix. The story sees several members of the Avengers team (who are too numerous to mention) battle the malevolent alien Thanos (an intimidating Josh Brolin). Everyone will put their egos aside in order to stop Thanos from getting the magical Infinity Stones and annihilating half of Earth's population. Avengers: Infinity War will thrill and emotionally devastate series fans, but the uninitiated will be lost. Despite the downbeat tone, the film contains unexpected humor from the character interactions and some of the best action in the franchise. The performances are uniformly strong, and Brolin steals the show as one of the series' best villains. Lastly, the emotionally charged ending is nothing short of heartbreaking for fans, changing the rules for both this universe and superhero films as we know them. Avengers: Infinity War is a thrilling, fun, and emotional climax to the past 10 years of Marvel's reign over the multiplex. May future installments continue to entertain as much as this. Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Sci-Fi Violence And Action Throughout, Language, And Some Crude References", "I am a big fan of the MCU and I've watched every single MCU film, and I have never seen such negativity on this one. Avengers Infinity War is a really good movie, no doubt about that. I mean sure that thanos is not the same one from the original comics, but the Russos and the writers wanted to make thanos more like a sympathetic character and I believe that all those haters of this movie are so negative because they're trying to curse Marvel Studios. Don't listen to these haters, idiots and critics who are trolling Infinity War. Just go and watch this movie while you still have the chance, and try to enjoy it like I did. And this movie like all MCU movies has a perfect balance between seriousness and humor but It has a dark tone. (45% serious, 12% funny, 43% dark)", "Avengers: Infinity War is a type of movie that is great in the sense that it brings together all of our favourite superheroes but is bad in the sense that it ends with the audience waiting to see part two.

This movie balances the jokes and action in a perfect manner. Avengers: Infinity War will always be a exciting experience for fans young and old.", "The best: Close virtually unbeatable for the ten years of the MCU, drink of the best of each Marvel saga. The way to bring all the protagonists together is sublime. The BSO and the CGI are the best that has been in the MCU to date. Unite with such elegance and naturalness the themes that are given in each of the films and none of them is out of place at any time. As for the CGI, what to say, one of Marvel's strengths since this universe began and once again does not disappoint. The brothers Russo direct and most importantly, they mount the film and that's where the difference between this film and a movie of the genre is noticed.\nThe worst: The script has more holes than a \"Gruyere cheese\" they teach a lot and they count little, they leave all the answers for the announced Avengers 4. The times of the film are quite badly taken and the subplot of Thanos and Gamora are left over in the movie .", "Some of the films that lead up to this have been a bit so so.\nAs mentioned before, if you have seen everything prior to this then you will have a good time. \nObviously all interlinked and great fight scenes and actually has a plot with some explainers in there.\nHad high hopes and low expectations but very surprised and delighted.\nIt was like watching a comic book story which is ultimately what we wanted.", "Is a challenge to put together all those characters.

Not sure I will want to go back for the second part, loosing a bit of trust in Hollywood... very sad.", "..subjective.\" Would be the obvious answer.\nLooking through the review section I hardly see any numbers between 1 and 10. So let me get my armchair and psychoanalyze this real quick. \nSome people love to love, some people love to hate.\nMy rating would be 72 out of 100 by the way.\nI admittedly enjoy the MCU as it has thus far served me with some unpretentious colorful entertainment and some neat characters. They treat these characters respectfully and fairly uncompromising throughout various different writers, directors and styles.\nIt's a unique enterprise that is usually quite enjoyable. But are any of those movies actually worthy of a 10 out of 10 based on a scale that includes all films ever made. Absolutely not! Would most film buffs resent my 8 out of 10 rating. Definitely!\nBut opinions really are quite subjective and I rate movies based on competence and entertainment value. The latter of which is where all the guilty pleasures fit in. I was damn surprised that this movie didn't turn out a cluster. It really should have, considering it's large cast and insane plot. But it feels very well paced for the most part and flows pretty well. And the big climax of the movie feels actually climactic within the entire MCU.\nMarvel Fans won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't. And I'm not a fan of anything. Because fandom is for babies.", "Avengers:Infinity War is a film that has a problem. A huge problem. Namely, how to encompass 10 years of screen history and 23 characters into one film so, that the end result would not take over three hours to complete, and not only be satisfying, but also good? It is hard, so the writers and the directors should be honored for having made a film as good as they did. There is also a great moral dilemma at the center, namely that of whether it is right to kill some in order that the many could have a better life? In that case, the films is really amazing, and also a great example of entertainment cinema. \n But. The films is not that good, and I have never been a huge fan of these Marvel movies-Star Wars and Harry Potter are blockbuster franchises that I like much more. And sometimes the writing is a bit out of hand, and having more than twenty main characters obviously translates to the fact than not all are very well developed. Herein, also lies a great problem. Avengers: Infinity War is a great film, make no mistake, with the best superhero film ending since The Dark Knight, but in order to really know these characters(except for Thanos, who is surprisingly fleshed out and could contend to the title of Main Character in this film) you have to watch their solo films-something that sadly is necessary for a franchise like this.But, otherwise from that, this here really is a great film.", "What's the main idea?Who cares about it!

Must see. Curius what the next one wil bring. Can't wait.", "If you know and love the MCU movies, this is the greatest 10 year anniversary gift you will ever get. This is the ultimate reward for you time and attention over the last decade. Bravo, Marvel Studios, Bravo!", "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is finally here after 10 years in the making and despite its huge scale and insane amount of characters it manages to pull it off. Let's get down to it by breaking down the things the movie nailed and some of the problems it had. Obviously, SPOILERS ahead so make sure to check out the movie first before reading this review.\n#1: Perfectly Balancing all the Characters.\nThe movie, as said above has an insane amount of characters and despite that it separates them in such a smart and natural way managing to balance both its characters and the story it was trying to tell. Everything is perfect when it comes to how the characters were split from Heimdall sending Hulk on Earth to warn the rest of the Avengers about the incoming threat to Ironman and Spiderman teaming up with Dr. Strange to Captain America rescuing Wanda and Vision ultimately uniting with the rest of the team in Wakanda. And despite the fact we didn't get a Steve/Tony reunion it is understandable considering how many things the movie had to do and it also increases the drama since Cap promised that if they are to lose they will do it together (back in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\") and the fact they lost apart makes it all the more devastating.\n#2: The Action.\nIt's Infinity War so one thing it should have is epic battle scenes...and it did. From the beginning of the movie where Thanos battles the Hulk (kicking the Green Goliath's ass in the process) to the final battles on Titan and Wakanda during both of which the Mad Titan reigns supreme. Sometimes the comic relief element does make things feel a bit out of place but the action and all the battles delivered by the movie were great and there were some pretty epic moments like Thor's entrance in Wakanda, Ironman going up against Thanos alone, Thanos vs all the Avengers at the end etc. that make up for the occasional jokes.\n#3: The Darkness.\nOne of the things this movie did is that it took a quite different approach in comparison with most MCU films. It's a dark movie that occasionally has comic relief elements (mostly when Guardians appear on screen) but overall it's a pretty depressing journey of characters doing their best in order to protect their loved ones from Thanos who feels like an unstopable force of nature. Some characters end up dying in the process laying the foundations for emotional scenes with great score delivered by Alan Silvestri who did a very good job with this movie. Especially the scene in which Thanos kills Gamora the soundtrack ascends the scene into one of the movie's greatest ones. The opening scene of the film is also Marvelous. Watching Thanos beating the crap out of Hulk and killing Loki by chocking him in front of Thor was shocking and works perfectly for setting up Thanos and what's to come.\n#4: Thanos.\nPretty much from the beginning of the movie we get the picture about what we're in for. Thanos beats Hulk and kills Loki in such a brutal way while his Black Order brutally eliminates the Asgardians on board the ship. He is to be feared and no character feels safe when around Thanos. He was vicious and so determined in accomplishing his goal. I also loved the fact they didn't use the Mistress Death concept to justify his search for the infinity stones. His motivation is that life must balance and that overpopulation across the universe brings chaos in the universal scale considering how resources are exhausting and how beings tend to exploit nature for their own personal gain. Eliminating half the universe by collecting all stones is what Thanos believes is the right thing to do. He strongly believes in his mission and he would stop at nothing to complete it. Even at sacrificing the one thing he ever truly loved in the process. The moment when he had to sacrifice Gamora to obtain the Soul stone was epic and showed us that Thanos is a villain with feelings who feels his mission outways his own emotional world. A villain that pictures himself as the hero of the story who's not afraid to sacrifice a great deal to do what he thinks is the right thing. Thanos was indeed the main character in Infinity War and I did feel for him a lot. One of the greatest comic-book villains that have appeared on the big screen.\n#5: The Snappening.\nDespite the fact it was a bit predictable and we could all see it coming the ending of the movie was shocking especially considering this is the MCU we're talking about. The movie decides to end with a cliffhanger most fans (including myself) saw coming. Thanos completing the infinity gauntlet and snapping his fingers wiping out half the universe including half of the Avengers and nearly all the Guardians leaving just the original Avengers with War Machine, Rocket and Nebula alive. A pretty shocking cliffhanger that makes the movie feel like a part 1 despite the Russos' attempts of making Infinity War standalone. Nonetheless the movie ended with the Avengers failing and despite we know some of the characters that were killed off during \"The Snappening\" will return, we expect the ones that are left to go the extra mile and sacrifice a great deal in order to undo the damage the Mad Titan caused. So I suppose that if some of them return in Avengers 4 it will require the ones that are left to pay the price. Plus, the reason I loved this ending is because it works perfectly with the main narrative of the movie...Thanos. I didn't care about most of the MCU's characters being (temporarily) killed but I did care about Thanos accomplishing his mission eventually smilling in our faces with a bitter sweet feeling that his crusade (despite being complete) did cost him everything. A great ending that leaves you wanting more.\nThese were pretty much the things I loved about \"Avengers: Infinity War\" but a movie that big certainly has a lot of things that could go wrong. No matter how good the experience was the movie had some problems that couldn't let me sleep during the night after I first watched it. So let's count them down shall we?\n#1: The Shifting Tone.\nOne of the things the Russos said they'd do with this movie is that they would shift the tone according to the characters we're following in each scene which was intriguing. Yet in my opinion it failed. The occasional jokes the movie had were refreshing and some of them funny (Stark's ego V Strange's ego) but when it comes to the Guardians the scenes are so ridiculous in terms of dialogue that they don't match with the seriousness of the scenes and the consequences they bring. The humor felt out of place most of the time and the screen time wasted on jokes could have been used for great character development scenes with descent dialogue instead of one liners about Thor's muscles and Peter Quill's fat. I believe the characters should have been adjusted according to the overall tone of the movie instead of the movie being compromised for the sake of humor (mostly derived by the Guardians).\n#2: Thanos' Backstory.\nThanos is a pretty interesting villain with many pros as I discussed above but there were things about the Mad Titan that didn't please me a lot. One of the cons is the fact we are not aware of his past apart from one line he says. I would really like to find out more about his backstory which I found lackluster in the film. Similarly to \"Man of Steel\" which perfectly sets up and explores General Zod's backstory right from the get go I would have LOVED to witness even a 2-minute flashback featuring Thanos as a politician in his homeworld proposing his idea to the rest of his planet's leaders or at least more information and details about his origins. Despite that he was a pretty interesting and compeling villain which makes me surpriced Infinity War is an MCU movie since they have a major problem in crafting a good villain and Thanos was beyond good.\n#3: Character Development.\nAnother problem the movie had was the lack of character development. Of course some characters were fleshed out pretty good like Thanos, Gamora, Scarlet Witch with Vision and Tony Stark who was a great leading figure thought-out the story but the film didn't further develop characters like Captain America whose involvement and character arc were incredibly minimal. It's understandable that the character development couldn't be big enough for all the characters considering how many of them are in this movie and how many things are taking place at the same time. Plus, we've all spent nearly 10 years following them and we already know who they are and where they come from but a better arc for Cap and for some other important characters is something we did not get from this movie and it bothered me a lot. The movie puts character development before action and although that's not entirely a bad thing the balance between the two is pretty bad.\nSo that's it for \"Avengers: Infinity War\". A good comic-book movie with many jaw-dropping moments, great action and heartbreak after watching the MCU coming to an end. One of the most important things Infinity War does is making its antagonist its protagonist and it's a very special and unique feat since Thanos is an incredibly well written villain and character. Besides, how many comic-book movies do you know where the villain gets to shine as the main character bringing moral complexity to the story to the point you actually root for him even a little bit (well...apart from \"The Dark Knight\")? Of course the movie could have been better without the problems above but since this is the part 1 I'll be waiting for Avengers 4 in order to view Infinity War as a two parted story and enjoy the full experience.\nGOOD: 7.5/10", "Review originally posted via Instagram (\"@oratiosanctus\") on April 29, 2018: ~ Avengers: Infinity War was a film I was eagerly anticipating for not just months, but years. Ever since Iron Man took first flight in 2008 and Thanos turned to smile at the audience in the mid-credits scene of the first Avengers movie in 2012. A decade in the making. The Russo Brothers do an amazing job of making this film come across like that. Infinity War had the monumental task of bringing together plot threads from 18 previous films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, but also to live up to the enormous ambition it had set for itself. Does it? Let's talk about it. This film is an event, an action blockbuster that carries itself with real stakes and a truly mesmerising performance from Josh Brolin as the Mad Titan himself, Thanos. Here is a villain who is layered, menacing, and emotionally resonant. It is not hyperbole to state that for the first time in the MCU, the villain of this picture is its true star. The CGI work on Thanos is impeccable and Brolin's motion capture is jaw-dropping. This sits on the level of Andy Serkis' Gollum and Caesar. One of the biggest fears going into this was how would it balance such a huge cast of characters? It does so admirably. Most are given their time to shine, and characters like Scarlet Witch and Vision are given their all to by their respective actors. This isn't a movie of one-liner cameos. Infinity War is undoubtedly Marvel's darkest and most daring film to date, and it tackles this with respect for what's come before it and to the pursuit of its own enormity. However, like all of Marvel's movies, it is not without its flaws. The Children of Thanos (or The Black Order) are entertaining, if not at times, disposable. Ebony Maw is the clear standout and he steals every scene he's in. Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, and Cull Obsidian are less interesting. The CG work is, at times, also lacking. While some characters you love will not get as much screen-time as others, the movie does a surprisingly effective job of making it appear they do. This is one film guaranteed as best experienced on the big screen.", "So we have 19 films in the MCU after 10 years we get the the end game in marvel phase 3 \nthis film has taken about five days to come with a review because of the enormous film it and plot detail and twists not give so much away \nBut the story and action has to be given so people know what is happening to everyone in this film \nlets just say its its like an empire strikes back from star wars and lets just say the next one will be \nlike return of the Jedi \nThis film is a modern classic an epic to beat all epic \nits is 10 out of 10 no fatigue what so ever \n2hrs 29mins and 10 mins for credits with an all important sos to \nthe ulitimate hero in a marvel ous universe so not giving plot spoilers just\nfigure that one out \nthis is my biggest written review i have giving \nwith 6 stones played out over 19 films\n 1 The Space Stone (a.k.a.

I would have gone 9 or 10 but there was too much Starlird and too much initial comedy relief.

Spider-Man and Iron Man were a great team-loved how Ebony Maw went down. Iron Man's nanotechnology armor was simply awesome. Very well set up for part 2. I hope Michael Douglas' \"The Iron Man Suit is a Toy\" Hank Pam shows up. He's the multiverse go to guy.", "For 10 years, Marvel has consistently pumped out masterful works of superheroes bringing the genre in the spotlight of modern cinema. Now the culmination of all their works has finally been released. This movie provides intense, edge of your seat action scenes; but also surprises with its emotional arcs. Every character you have grown to love has a moment to shine in this film. Bu the real spotlight is on the villainous Thanos, who plans to become the most powerful being in the universe. While a large majority of the villains within the MCU have been forgettable with no proper character development, Thanos changes the game. Within the first few moments of the film, you witness the strong presence of Thanos. But no good villain is without proper character development. Throughout the film, we are shown Thanos' motives and are given an emotional dilemma for Thanos, which, despite being a Mad Titan, actually humanizes him in an unexpected way. Overall, this film is filled with star performances, fantastic action set pieces, and a menacing yet emotion view on a villain.The Russo brothers have given us another summer blockbuster that will please the fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with this intense and heart-breaking film.", "I begin with the caveat that this is in fact my first review on this site (even though I have been tempted to rant about others).  I am a major fan of superheroes and the battle between good vs. evil. I have watched every MCU movie to date except Black Panther (didn't get the chance to yet but will soon). I have enjoyed all of them to varying degrees and for different reasons, but one common element that I felt was lacking was consequence and risk for our heroes. Avengers: Infinity War changes that on a large scale, and it works perfectly for me. I loved it! It provides for a more powerful, emotional experience when the possibility of a villain succeeding is higher.  While this works well for my taste, I can see where some have issue, and I feel the need to caution those who have not seen it. I look to other reviews who have rated this film rather low and have voiced some of these concerns: All in all, I recommend this movie to everyone, but be prepared. Avengers: Infinity War will not hold your hand if you're new to the franchise or to comics, and its not afraid to leave people behind as it takes this risky but awesome leap.", "So first I'll tell you this. I never loved Marvel movies, so this is unbiased, and more critical of Infinity War as a film, not as just a Marvel movie. If you are a hardcore Marvel fan, and you for some reason did not see it opening weekend, you should still see it despite it's not being the best of Marvel. It is not an objectively terrible movie, it just isn't really as strong as some other Marvel productions. But you certainly will like it being a fan of Marvel, but probably not if you aren't into the style/genre. SPOILERS AHEAD:  Now to get deeper, this movie will make you leave the theater thinking, \"What the hell?\" This goes for Marvel fans and everyone else. Despite my not loving Superhero movies, I have seen all of the Avengers Films, and most of the major Marvel films of the past 10 years. I've seen the Captain America Movies, the Iron Man movies, the Thor movies (not the Thor sequel because it was supposed to be god awful), etc. This movie though was different. Although the Avengers movies do rely on having all of the Marvel star heroes unite, this one tried something even more insane, which was having pretty much every single Marvel franchise of the past 10 years combine (with a few exceptions), which was wayyy more than in the past. And frankly, too much for a two and a half hour movie (although if the solution were to extend this movie I would have walked out or fell asleep). I favor the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise over the other Marvel franchises. And I feel that way not because of the character depth, but I like its style and genre. Marvel movies do this. They change the genre in the different franchises to make them suit different kinds of people. Guardians of the Galaxy was a fun adventure saga with lots of colors and effects backed by an epic mixtape. Captain America was war movie style. Deadpool (not in Infinity War) is comedy, and one of the few of their movies to receive the R rating. And these genres are good alone, but kinda weird to combine. Guardians of the Galaxy for example totally does not fit in to Infinity War. The sole reason it does is the Gamora Thanos connection, which was clearly formed in Guardians of the Galaxy for the sole reason to get that Thanos connection in, because everyone has to have some connection to Thanos and therefore the Infinity Stones to be in this movie. And I'm not saying they should have been removed from this movie and left a standalone. They were necessary for the plot, but only because Marvel made them necessary. Saying that, Marvel does deserve credit for making almost every franchise in Infinity War relevant somehow. Black Panther though wasn't really needed, they only really used Wakanda as a battlefront, and their technology was used on Vision, but they could have gotten the tech elsewhere.\nNow, about that ending. This ending is so completely far fetched that while leaving the movie, one of the theater attendants said something like, \"I'm sorry that was so disappointing.\" Even though it was \"sad\" to see so many characters cease to exist, remember, even though Infinity War is symbolizing the end of a lot of characters (contracts), there is another Avengers movie in post production right now, so we can assume that it will have a happy ending of sorts, because unfortunately Hollywood doesn't have the balls anymore to leave a multi-billion dollar franchise on a sad note. Not that I want the characters dead, but my call is that everyone comes back to life again, leaving on a happy note, which is kind of clich\u00e9, and it bothers me. My prediction is the remaining Avengers hunt down Thanos one final time, with the goal of retrieving his glove, and destroying the Infinity Stones, but first they use the time stone to reverse time, and bring everyone back to life again (probably discounting Gamora and Loki; I swear if Loki comes back to life one more time...) But anyways, the movie was fine, but just a bit overboard on the characters, a bit too long, and overhyped.", "Go into this movie knowing as little as possible. There are a ton of surprises that I wasn't expecting. That fact that there have been 30 superhero movies in the past 10 years and this movie still manages to surprise me is a testament to how good this movie is. This is definitely my favorite MCU movie now. With Civil War being my number 2.", "Avengers: Infinity War is the best film ever in the MCU. It gives everything its all. This movie deserves for more than one Oscar award next year as it is a total blast.\nThe CGI is jaw-droppingly awesome with very good and steady editing and the direction is sheer perfection. This is one of the movies that I would like to go to the cinema again for another 10 times. This is even better than Black Panther as Black Panther was story ridden but still good. The writing of the script is very well written with amazing lines that are well said. The acting is out of this world especially from Josh Brolin who plays the villain Thanos who gives it his all. The action sequences with the fantastic sound, visual and special effects. The music was very intense and dramatic which went well with the action and all the explosives going off. If you're a fan of the MCU comic book movies then this is one for you.", "The most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet. Its kind of amazing is how seamlessly the various pieces of the Marvel fit together. Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. This is the movie not to be missed.", "First off, the ratings for this movie are so inconsistent, it appears you are either a \"Marvel fanboy\" or a hater with ratings of only 1s or 10s; with limited information on why these ratings are justified or on people focusing on one minor issue. I found the film to be pretty good, engaging for the most part, and allowed most of the characters to shine. However, considering the near ten year wait for this film I expected damn near perfection, although probably unfairly.  There was nothing glaringly wrong with the film, just inconsistencies, similar to that of Thanos' powers, which is probably to be expected when a film has over 30 main characters!  Speaking of Thanos, it was a refreshing change to have a villain whose background and motivation is explained and relatable, in the sense it was not \"I have to kill the Avengers because the plot demands it\". Unfortunately, (I am not a comic-book nerd before I get shot down), Thanos' seemed overpowered from the start, trivializing his conquest for the stones. Unfortunately, whilst Thanos was great, his henchmen were laughable. They were unexplained faceless characters, using characters in the loosest sense, ill explained and boring to watch. Again their powers seem to change to suit the plot, which was irritating. The comedy was spot-on for the most part, although one of the villains death's was an unintentional funny, reminiscent of Palpetine's death in Robot Chicken Starwars.  Whilst most of the film was engaging, there was a lot of shifting between plot lines, as the story/team were broken into pockets across the universe. A smart move for a film with so many characters, but some plot lines were extremely dull and I was wishing the film would shift back again (sorry Cap/Vision). Whenever Thor/ Guardians on the screen it was at it's best, and I was hoping the film would turn into a GOTG/Thor crossover exclusively.  The final moments were unexpected, *SPOLIERS* not the fact that Thanos succeeds in his plan but in the way it was done was touching, and a surprising death toll to our heroes. Although, it all boils down to a huge fist-fight battle with nothing really clever going on. Yes there is the stuff with Vision, however he is unlikable and under-powered, possibly with the viewer baying for his blood. I believe one of the lines the Cap says to him is \"we don't trade lives\" tell that to all the Wakanda's dying needlessly just to save him. Unfortunately, you know who isn't going to die and makes the second film somewhat predictable.\n \nOverall it is a typical Marvel film, nothing to shout about but a fun day out and I would suggest that you go and see it, unless you have children under 8 as you will have to console them for weeks to come. 8/10.", "Delivers of the hype, wasn't predictable and probably one of the best movie villains of all time", "Never thought I would see this in the big screen. Well done, Marvel/Disney!", "Marvel movies are not really my style. I have not seen the first Avengers or most of the previous Marvel Movies but I still thought it was really good. I liked the cast, I was entertained, My kids loved it. I think a wide range of people will like this. It is definitely worth seeing. We probably wouldn't have gone to see this in theaters If we didn't Have MoviePass. We love it. Looking forward to seeing the new Jurassic Park.", "Although there are a lot of heroes but the story is not messy. Thanos is so human and Iron man is great as usual. Thor also evolves so much...", "That cliffhanger ending isn't much of a cliffhanger, we've watched all these movies for that to happen? almost perfect marvel, but you don't have this fan fooled.", "I watch this movie knowing what will happen. I expect it to be dark and it actually is. Unlike the previous film, this one is more greedy and that's what makes it unforgettable. Problem for me is....Warning Spoilers: Many characters in the film have been overshadowed by other characters so don't expect that all of your favorite characters will have a great highlight & Some heroes mostly makes bad decisions that they became annoying throughout an intense scene but like doctor strange points out, all of those things happening are according to what he saw in his time stone. Still it's a fun movie to watch with your family or friends and here's a tip if you're a MCU Fan, know every infinity stones and what it can do because many will ask you what does it do, mostly those who doesn't watch all the mcu films throughout the years.", "Probably the most amazing movie I have ever watched in my entire life. WOW", "To commemorate the tenth anniversary of MCU, spearheaded by IRON MAN (2008), the third Avengers assembly vehemently pushes the envelop of the superhero mishmash, now has a plethora of roll call at the creators' disposal, and bang!, it puts half of the entire universe's population at the risk of perdition if the mega-villain Thanos (Brolin under heavy CGI reconstruction) successfully collects all six Infinity Stones (Power, Space, Reality, Soul, Time, Mind) in his gauntlet.  Apparetly this chapter boasts a series of all-out pitched battles across the galaxy as the fans know it, and marshals stimulating pairing-ups (Iron Man, Spidey mingling with Doctor Strange, Thor saved by Guardians of the Galaxy quintet, and the rest are united in Wakanda) through its non-stop action escapades, whether it is on spaceships, Earth, or other forbidding-looking planets, with a teleporting Thanos always getting what he wants (and rubbing out several peripheral characters offhand), whereas the Avengers can only savor a triumphant tang by eliminating his quartet of minions, aka. Children of Thanos (including Carrie Coon's Proxima Midnight) together with innumerable and ferocious cannon fodders. The stakes are extremely high, and what lends Thanos an upper-hand to lay his hands on the stones is his hellbent resolution, even if it means to sacrifice someone he loves, a crescendo reaches in the midpoint when the irony of Thanos' loveless temperament suddenly altered by his ostensible crocodile's tears, which reveals his most profound feelings under a villain's pedestrian merciless carapace, and believe it or not, it actually grants him legitimacy to attain the Soul Stone, at that point, one can sense the premonition that nothing can stop him. Yet, the writers offers one fat chance to subdue him in the epic battle executed by the pageantry of teamwork on the planet of Titan, only backfires in the hands of Star-Lord (Pratt), owing to his irrational rage of some very bad tidings, well, a one-stone-two-birds coincidence couldn't be more expeditious. It is sensible to lay down the final battle on the tiny globe called Earth for earthlings' geocentric pride, and in Wakanda no less, riding on the coattail of BLACK PANTHER's phenomenal popularity. After another much-tarried sacrifice seemingly scuttles Thanos' plan in the Avengers' collective, last-ditch bravado, however, in possession of the Time Stone (Doctor Strange, this one is on your relented sentimentality), Thanos is able to revert to a previous moment and fulfills his feat with a plaintive cliff-hanger when a selected bunch of our favorite heroes morphs into dust and vanishes into thin air.   In the mean, INFINITY WAR is a farrago of state-of-the-art rescue-and-fighting rough-and-tumble in its most kaleidoscopic register, punctuated by amusing one-liners and japes notwithstanding (Drax the Destroyer should be re-coined as the Prankster), and astutely trades on audience's accumulative investment of its bloated dramatis personae, prepares us a bottoming-out scenario for the more rousing turnaround in its upcoming next installment. Most major characters are understandably shortchanged due to its enterprising scale, Thor (Hemsworth) arguably gets the most boost by a new eye-ball and a freshly wrought storm-breaker axe, and Gamora (Saldana), predicated on a closer relation with Thanos, is allowed a more heart-felt passage to finish her own precarious journey, elsewhere, INFINITY WAR doesn't outdo a common MCU audience's moderate expectation, but a solid job is something of a merit at this step, although one might detect a trace of too-big-to-fail conceit might stymie any further bold maneuver in this most lucrative cinematic universe that has been entertaining an overpopulated planet for a decade and now orbits right into its red-hot heyday.", "Pardon the clich\u00e9, but Infinity War is truly an emotional roller coaster. Unlike previous entries in this long-running behemoth of super-people, this ride's ascents and dives come faster and furious-er than Vin Diesel driving a sports car through a skyrise window. And (at the risk of really pushing the metaphor) this coaster's biggest drop comes seconds before you exit the ride, leaving audiences with a sense of \"Woah...\", unlike most other comic book films.\nTo clarify, this isn't the best MCU film. For one thing, better entries in the series say something outside of themselves. Iron Man touches on the military-industrial complex. Spider-Man deals with modern-day class issues. All the Captain America entries wrestle brilliantly with government overreach. Infinity War is (for better or worse) focused on plot and character. In spots, it lands its punches (Thor's arc, Thanos' brutality, anything Guardians); in others, it misses (initial attack on NYC, Vision & Scarlet Witch love story, anything Cap). It's a gargantuan undertaking, and your investment in the story and forgiveness of its unwieldiness will only goes as far as your predetermined commitment.\nIf you haven't been keeping up with the franchise (which is essentially a big-budget television show), this is not the episode to jump in on. A 10 years / 18 films / 50+ superheroes bottleneck whose ambition has only been matched by its success. By its very nature, there's only so much you can do to keep this thing from flying off the rails. However, if you're already committed, then the endless barrage of humor and excitement, which crescendos into an unexpected emotional gut-punch, will make for a haunting and bold (though not quite fantastic) Marvel outing.", "I'm just gonna come out and say this: from an action, \"popcorn\" perspective, Infinity War is a mesmerising spectacle that sucks you right in until the credits roll after its deceptively long 2hr 29min running time. As someone who has seen many (but isn't a diehard fan) of the Marvel films, I was pleasantly surprised at the ways in which such a colossal picture manages to invest in its myriad of characters, backstories and locations. The plot is very simple, but the Russo brothers do a fantastic job at enthralling viewers with what is essentially Thanos's search for the 6 infinity stones that tie the different film universes together. Scenes are snappy and fluid, with dialogue kept to a bare minimum of character introductions and brief exchanges of quippy one-liners. There's a fair dose of \"Marvel\" humour running throughout that many will enjoy, but personally I found some of the more contrived lines a bit painful to listen to. Thankfully, this is resolved by the truly awesome spectacle of near-constant action that unfolds - the sequences evolve rapidly and shift between multiple locations, giving you a true sense of the scale of the film without feeling detached from its events. The final third in particular contains some of the best sequences I've ever seen in a superhero movie.  There are many, many standout performances in this film. As ever, Robert Downey Jr puts in a great shift as a Tony Stark still traumatised by the previous films, but also reprising his role of mentor to Tom Holland's Spiderman - who steals the limelight as the franchise's newest, funniest and tear-jerking new avenger. Benedict Cumberbatch also puts in a stellar shift in reprising his role of Doctor Strange, but the film's strongest performance by far is Josh Brolin's voice portrayal of Thanos. I had a lot of trepidation going into this film about how \"shallow\" Thanos as a villain was going to be, but Brolin delivers an emotional roller-coaster leaving us torn between fear, hatred, sympathy, and even a grudging respect for the MCU's biggest bad boy. Thanos is given a fantastic emotional arc that really encourages sympathy and makes him a far more three-dimensional character shown to suffer almost as much as the heroes do.  Infinity War is an ambitious step up for the Marvel franchise - yes the plot is basic, but the scale is so large that it has to be. The film stays true to its focus on delivering pure, unbridled super-hero action, and this is helped by its huge web of complex characters that interact with one another to make this the richest, most intricate Marvel film yet and a strong start to the next chapter of the Avengers story.", "Notwithstanding previous crossovers, Infinity War has crossovers with other parts of the MCU only they are made very inclusive to the plot as they are presented together to fight Thanos.\nThanos is played by Josh Brolin and he previously played him in a small role in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 and Avengers: Age of Ultron.\nThis time around Thanos dominates proceedings as he is the villain to watch here and my attention to him was certainly unwavering.\nI had no expectations on Brolin as Thanos so I can say without doubt that he played extremely well.\nThe presence of the non-Avengers characters was handled well because despite this being an Avengers movie they do not feel in anyway intrusive.\nIt was known beforehand that Infinity War is the first in a two-parter so it is no surprise that it ends on a cliffhanger and an amazing cliffhanger after battles that just took place.\nMy primary reason for seeing Avengers: Infinity War is Karen Gillan as Nebula in this her third appearance as the character after the first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies and it was pretty good what she was given to do here. Matthew See\nSpocksoc Vice President", "Over these 10 years, apart from a few exceptions Marvel Studios has delivered film after film that have been beyond amazing with lovable characters and some smart writing . When I look back on the kind of comic book movies we got in childhood then this film would seem completely impossible . Yet the Russo brothers pulled off the best they could , nobody other studio has ever tried something like this. A lot of people have complained about character development but the thing is we've already had 19 films that focused on our heroes' character arcs. The only character we didn't know anything about is Thanos so the movie mostly focused on him . An argument can be made that such popcorn flicks are for every casual viewer out there and you can't expect everyone to watch 10 years of movies , but that would basically be similar to being excited about Season 8 of Game of Thrones without having seen the first 7 of them . MCU does follow a serial format when it comes to crossovers and this can be considered the first half of the series finale. Thanos is probably the most interesting villain I've seen in a long time. It's even difficult to call him a villain. He thinks of himself as a savior. It's a smart choice to change his motivation from what it was in the comics . A literal personality of Death would've seemed weird at this point . He doesn't wipe out half the universe for the sake of it like most generic villains. For him it's a far more intimate reason , having watched his home planet destroyed because of over population we understand where he comes from even though we know that this is the wrong way of taking action. Despite being incredibly harsh and cruel he isn't devoid of feeling, he does seem to love his favorite daughter, Gamora.And when forced to choose between the soul stone or Gamora, Thanos' indecision and anguish is laid bare for all to see even Gamora herself is shocked Thanos actually really cares for her.And as the movie ends, we get a glimpse of Thanos looking all pensive , staring at the sunset, likely thinking about Gamora. Even though he appears to be at peace now that his plan has worked, it's a hollow triumph as he's all alone without the daughter he loved. It was definitely the most heart breaking of all the many deaths in this film , and even though this relationship wasn't explored in the previous Guardian films ..... Enough screen time is allotted and Josh Brolin and Zoe Saldana make this work. On a film with such high stakes the jokes are delightful and tension puncturing (in a good way). I'm no expert on action,but I liked what I saw and I do have my favourites even though it was a little dizzying. The course of action taken by characters never seem out of character (yes even Peter Quill). The CGI doesn't seem all that bad to me like what I feared before for Thanos.The digital artists have done a great job making him feel real even in close up shots.The only thing hard to notice was Banner's head sticking out of the Hulk Buster . That wasn't done well and it just felt like a bad Photoshop job. Steve Rogers was criminally under used. There's really nothing to complain about the acting .... Tom Holland, RDJ, Chris Hemsworth and Pratt deserve a special nod apart from Josh Brolin again . From Goonies to Milk to Infinity War now , that dude never disappoints. The universal stakes really hit home on a visceral level than any other movie before. Having read the \"Infinity Gauntlet\" before and knowing about half the population dying it would seem that you're prepared but watching these character we've known for quite some time now disintegrating into thin air really makes you feel emotional. Since the original team-up is still alive and most of the characters upon whom the future has been built are dead rather disintegrated by the snap . It's fair to assume that they'll be back but that doesn't make it feel worthless to me at all. Captain America who lost his friend a third time , Vision having to die twice that too in the hands of the woman he loves , Spiderman who at the end of the day is just a small kid , watching him being afraid of dying .....it really hits home very hard . Plot wise whatever the reception is right now I think it'll warm up more in future when the sequel comes out . Because of ending on such a note everyone's heart is really begging for a closure. But as a set up to what's about to happen next and making us prepared for higher stakes this film does it's job efficiently. Eagerly looking forward to catching it again this weekend. Not my favourite MCU film till date but it certainly ranks in Top 5.", "Watched Avengers:Infinity War Starring Chris Evans(Captain America:The Winter Soldier) as Steve Rogers/Nomad, Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man) as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth(Thor Ragnarok) as Thor, Mark Ruffalo(Now You See Me)as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, Scarlett Johansson (Captain America:Civil War) as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow , Elizabeth Olsen(Avengers:Age Of Ultron) as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch, Paul Bettany(Iron Man 3) as Vision ,Benedict Cumberbatch(Doctor Strange) as Doctor Strange,Tom Holland(Spider-Man Homecoming )as Peter Parker/Spider-Man , Tom Hiddleston(The Avengers) as Loki , Chadwick Boseman(Black Panther) as T'challa/Black Panther , Anthony Mackie(Ant-Man) as Sam Wilson/The Falcon,Don Cheadle(Iron Man 2) as Rhodey/War Machine .

It just made me wonder what would happen next all the time and it was never boring in any scene!

And the Action and Effects were just amazing! They blended all the 18 Movies together really good! The only Criticism I have is that after the deaths of especially: Black Panther, Guardians, Dr. Strange and Spider-Man. You know that they are coming back because there are Movies announced for them but I guess we already knew that since the Comic brought them back to life too. In another way probably, but they did. So all in all It was a terrific movie with just a little Criticism on the shocking ending!", "I can't help but think of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' after watching 'Avengers: Infinity War.' The two of them may have been made by Disney, but they are worlds apart when it comes to giving the fans what they were after. The latest 'Star Wars' may have been okay, but it was generally disregarded by many die-hards. However, despite the Avengers - technically - pumping out more films in its franchise and therefore potentially suffering from fatigue regarding its premise, it's been hailed as a classic - and for good reason. It shows that, despite having numerous previous (and dare I say similar?) outings, a sequel doesn't have to be stale. I suppose there must be some people out there who have never seen an 'Avengers' movie before (or even one from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), so, for the two of you, this is the third outing where Earth's mightiest superheroes are forced to come together to defend the planet from an alien, hell-bent on wiping out 50% of the universe. You may be thinking that this is just another modern action film, filled with computer-generated special effects and scripted one-liners. And you'd be right. However, I always find that computer-generated battles are only bad if the effects are bad and they drag on and scripted one-liners only don't work if they're forced and there's no chemistry between the actors. I'm pleased to say that, although 'Avengers: Infinity War' has both, they only add to the proceedings. With a cast as big as is needed to bring characters from every Marvel movie together, there's always going to be a couple who don't get quite as much screen time as some of us would like. However, you should really expect that and realise it was going to be difficult for the writers to please everyone. Personally, I've always been a fan of Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of 'Iron Man' (I don't think I'm alone on that one), so I was happy to see that he was - possibly - given the most screen time out of anyone. However, no matter how good the goodies are, they need a good bad-guy to fight. The Marvel movies have often been criticised for a lack of real threatening baddies (Loki excluded), so we finally get to see he who has been in the background for so long, Thanos. And he's worth the wait. He's a bad guy we can not only love to hate, but also - in a strange way - see that he has a point, or at least a point of view from his own perspective. Josh Brolin portrays him brilliantly and you'll forget that most of him is computer-generated after a while. Yes, 'Infinity War' is part of the overall franchise, but you don't really have to have seen every previous movie to 'get' everything that's happening here (obviously, the more Marvel movies you've seen the more you'll get out of this one, but it's not essential). I suppose if there is one complaint of mine it's that I know which characters are truly in danger here, due to the actors' contracts either due to expire, or only just being picked up. Either way, it's a definite improvement on the previous 'Avengers' movie, as the 'Age of Ultron' felt strangely 'meh' for one that should have been so much more. If you like the MCU, you'll like this. If you like action film, you'll also love it. It's - sort of - a family movie in that a lot of families will go to see it, but, either way, it's so epic in scale that most should appreciate it for the sheer spectacle it is. Poor Justice League - it never really stood a chance.", "Avengers Infinity War is ther third instalment of the Avengers films and all I got to say about this is that this film is HUGE and the stakes is larger than life itself. What can I say about this film?This film has a great pace despite being longer than 150 minutes and also being the longest film in the MCU. This film overall is GREAT,the pacing,most of the comedy,the action,the drama,the tension and the romance was suprisingly handled well. Okay so Thanos might be the most intimidating comic book film villain of all time and he in my opinion is the best MCU villain. But,there is a number of flaws which are some of the comedy does not land,some of the subplots felt rushed and the other flaws I will not get into because I would be spoiling the movie already. Also,I could see this movie being a very divsive film. Just go watch it is what I'll say and I will understand if you disliked the film or liked the film. (9/10/A)", "I've been waiting for watching this movie over 10th years.\nand this movie very very AMAZING\nFUNNY, SAD, All In One Place in this movie.\nGood Job MCU.\ncan't wait for next movie after THANOS SNAP his Finger.", "Avengers: Infinity War is a climax of all 18 movies completed over a past decade. People hate this film is probably\n1) Do not watch those 18 MARVEL MOVIES or forgotten their story lines (go home and re watch).\n2) Too much real expectation (This is a comic book movie so it is not real).\n3) Upset about plot holes and big cliffhanger (of course, there will be Avengers 4, so be patient and just accept the movie as it is).\n4) They are not superhero stories fan (please find another movie that suits your favorite). As a movie fan, I am glad that alive until today to see these years of masterpieces together, well organized and well played, although there are so many characters and plots to put in a 2 and half hours movie. I felt that this movie need more time like three hours, to see more the beauty of its story line. However, to see another Avenger movie on next year for knowing how the story will unfold is the best thing ever in my life.", "Let me start by saying that I am an avid MCU fan and have seen all the previous entries, however I can acknowledge when the franchise goes wrong (the sequels to Iron Man, Thor, and Avengers comes to mind). Infinity War did an utterly incredible job of tying together 10 years of storytelling. For what this movie was meant to be, I don't think they could have changed a thing to make it any better (save a few lines that didn't land or jokes that ran a bit too long). The acting and dialogue is on par with the past few movies, with good performances all around, but some really stand out ones from Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, and of course Josh Brolin. The action is great, there's good close cut hand to hand scenes that the Russos are famous for and more impressive sprawling epic battle scenes as well. The CGI is mostly good, especially on Thanos and the alien planets, however a few of the children of Thanos did look like 4 year old video game characters to me. The biggest criticism I've heard of this movie is that it's inaccessible to non-MCU fans, which I think is perfectly valid. If you've only seen a scattered few of the movies, you could very likely get lost as they don't spend time re-introducing characters and previous plot lines. I will say however, that at this point, 19 movies in, you should probably have developed an opinion on the MCU by now. Those who thoroughly enjoy the stories and characters will be caught up and this movie will blow them away. For people who are more casual fans who just go for the action and jokes and aren't wrapped up in the overarching plots and character arcs, Infinity War can still deliver exactly what they want. Lastly, for people who just flat out dislike the franchise, this movie won't change their mind. It's more of what we've gotten in the previous 18 entries but on a more epic scale. As a hard-core fan, this movie had me wanting to jump out of my seat and cheer at some moments, and cry at others. Infinity War is truly the reward fans of the franchise are getting after 10 years. I will say however, that it is hard to rank it compared to the rest of the MCU. Since this movie ends on such a large cliff hanger that must be resolved in the follow up, it's very hard to look at it as a complete story. My guess is that people will lump Infinity War and Avengers 4 together as one large movie, much like people do with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2. If the follow up sticks the landing and completes this story in a compelling way, then this movie would probably land in my top 5 just above the first Avengers, but conversely it could get dragged down if the sequel doesn't hold up. I cannot wait to see how this story is wrapped up next year, and strongly encourage fans of the franchise to check this one out in theaters. If you haven't yet discovered the joys of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, certainly don't start with this one, but make sure you come back to it 18 movies later. It's worth the wait.", "I really hoped to give this a 10 or 9 but keeping it real here...loved how the Marvel movies keep all the actors/characters together to pull off these Avenger movies. Very good job of pulling the plots of all the individual movie plots together. I think IF you haven't seen all the other movies than you may get lost and/or have less positive reviews. Went to first weekend showing and was not disappointed even with the few miscues listed by others here as spoilers. Definitely see the strategy for a Part Two which is coming next year. Hopefully, the storyline will start reflecting the comic book storyline soon or these movies will start to lose us...", "I've really never been a big fan of the Marvel movies. I've done extensive research on them and read many of the comics but I haven't really been into them as much as lets say Star Wars or other movies you may feel fit the same type of scale as these movies do. With that said DAMN! What a ride this movie was, from start to finish. It did have it's \"lol\" points but I feel that's to be expected from a \"non James Gunn\" directed MCU movie. It's small and spread out lol moments were very far and inbetween and rarely stood out and always felt as if they were advancing the story in the best possible way.  That was really my only problem with this movie. I found the lack of a traditional structure and character development to not hinder the movie as other critics have but instead kind've enhanced it. I'm glad Disney let the Russo brothers do their thing and make a gorgeously directed Marvel film with no limits especially for a movie as important as this AND after they received all the same backlash from the Star Wars fans for the The Last Jedi. I feel comparing this movie to The Last Jedi is actually pretty fair match. They both are made by Disney, both have gorgeous cinematography and BOTH have great directors who are trying to bend expectations. The difference is with The Last Jedi you've seemed to feel stupid and belittled, while Infinity War pats you on the back and shows you one last time who these characters are and whose ass they're going to kick. Infinity Wars ending was a trumphiant and bold idea that i feel couldn't have been done any better.  Every single section scene and part of dialogue was exceptionally well done. The shocker ending making you think are they really going to do that? along with one of the best scores in a Marvel movie combine to create a wonder movie with possibly the best Marvel villain ever put on the big screen. The ending I feel is perfect, it's something that takes you for a loop and leaves you heart struck. The thing that ruins it for me is the knowledge that it's going to be undone with the next Avengers movie, Spider-Man Homecoming 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp and Gardinas of the Galaxy 3. It would be better off to see the movie series end off here being that literally anything else added to this intricate and complex storyline will just make anything else feel like a bloated unnecessary epilogue to the movie making it feel like the stakes were for nothing. As it stands now though, no matter what happens to the MCU, this will always feel to me like the perfect send off. Let the Avengers, assemble.", "Marvel seriously sells character and not the story. People are giving ratings who don't even know the basic character and the storyline. It lacked twists which were expected. Movie was packed with a lot of characters and many important characters got a decent screen time. Downey nailed his role again, Josh brolin was amazing as Thanos. In fact since all the Marvel movies, Thanos is the best villain who overpowers almost all the avengers. In a fight with Dr. Strange, he didn't use the time stone. If he had used it, I think that would have been a pain for Thanos. No reason explained why he didn't use it. May be used the stone in an alternate universe and saw avenger's defeat in future. No hulk for 95% of the movie-a big disappointment. Overall a good superhero movie but residing on No. 9 in top 250, you have got to be kidding me. There is seriously wrong with the ratings. This movie is not even close to LOTR.", "This movie is surely one the best out there. From well balanced humour to thrilling action, everything is perfect. The plot is easy to follow and twists are engaging. Anyone who loves movies has to watch this one.", "Avengers: Infinity War is by far Marvel's most ambitious film ever. And it mostly pays off, after 10 years of buildup. With incredible effects, masterful sound design, great characters complimented by a fantastic cast, and some of the best action in marvel films. However it's uneven tone, some unfocused characters, and probably some of the worst comic relief in a Marvel film hold it back from being a great film. Nonetheless, the end result is a blast from start to finish, that should satisfy fans.", "Great action from start to finish. But I left the theater like \"WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!\" I'm not sure how I really feel about this. May take me awhile to watch again, if I decide to.", "Infinity War is a great superhero movie with a good mixture of action, drama, and comedy. Marvel has outdone themselves with an epic movie ten years in the making.", "Are there plot holes and/or issues with the movie, yes. However, for the amount of characters and things going on in this movie, they did a great job making a coherent good movie. I found myself laughing and having a really good time with this movie and I never got bored. It makes me really excited to see the next avengers movie and where they go from here.", "Reflecting back on the over dozen previous entries into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's clear that this is what we've been building toward for about a decade and it certainly pays off. From the first time Nick Fury showed up in an end credits scene and let us know that an MCU was about to takeoff, to the first time Thanos showed up in an end credit scene and told us that he was a threat to be afraid of, all the anticipation built to Avengers: Infinity War and the Russo brothers tell an awe inspiring story that makes the 10 year wait well worth it.  What may be a setback of the film for some more casual movie-goers, is that the film certainly doesn't hold your hand or spend anytime introducing you to the heroes of the MCU. You're expected to be familiar with large scale events that took place previously in the universe and the characters who are involved in it. I for one, am thankful they went this route as I don't possibly see any way that this story could have been told in it's time constraint with character reintroductions at every turn. The movie is fast paced chaos and the tone as set right off the bat. The CGI is near perfection. Thanos, a near full CGI villain with motion capture done by Josh Brolin, is truly brought to life. It's always good to be wary with CGI villains since we so often see them fail miserably, but Thanos was pulled into our reality by the animators with every minute facial expression, squint, and wince. The brilliant voiceover work by Josh Brolin certainly helped establish the villain as well. The performances by the massive, wonderful cast are all done to near perfection. No one misses a beat and they all stay true to their characters, which is also a testament to how well the Russo brothers worked with the task of bringing MCU characters into their film who were previously established by other minds in their own standalone films. That's all I want to get into to spare spoiling anything, but I can't recommend this enough. If you haven't seen an MCU film prior to this one, I highly suggest checking out at least the previous two Avengers films if not the entire MCU before arriving to this film.", "Who would have thunk it? This beast is complex, mostly well written and mostly well directed (some of the action scenes were a mess, per usual CGI hijinks). It starts fast, there is a battle scene with lots of dead and dying but they're not your typical soldiers, these are Asgard's finest, including Thor and Loki. World killing Thanos casually picks up one dying soldier and brings him to stage center, it's Thor........and we're on our way, there is an inevitability here that matches, for the most part, the scale of what is being presented - the killing of 50% of all sentient creatures in.........the universe. There is a quest, but depending on your POV, it's not necessarily a noble quest. A great coalition is brought together to battle Thanos and it's mostly not the cheesy typical \"the gangs all here\" Marvel cluster f__K, this is a big war and everyone is needed, even the guardians of the galaxy and their insipid banter, really out of place in this movie, as was the main guardian's move when they were about to stop Thanos, super mechanically maladroit \"solution, again, the scale of the movie's intent was far beyond this hamfisted scene. This is quibbling though, the pathos embedded in this movie allowed it to achieve escape velocity, Thanos is not Sauron, he as a soul, he has deep feelings for what he does, he sacrifices that which he loves the most for what he believes are noble motives (that's the main problem with people, we all got our reasons). And Thanos most astounding of all, \"wins\", he get's all the infinity stones and 50% of the Universe's citizens simply turn into ash including many of the superheroes.....that was something I did not expect, so not the typical US blockbuster..........most of the apparent good guys die and the villain wins, resting in the long sunset, enjoying the fruits of his efforts. Credits role......", "A smash hit for fans, creepy climax and an amazing cliffhanger. What is there not to like?", "Pure cinematic voyeurism and fun. A ride from start to finish that is mysterious, thrilling, filled with non-stop action (to the point where almost every talking scene is interrupted by action). \nWhile the film does tie inholes from previous films, the Russo brothers manage to leave enough to look forward to with Avengers 4 with nothing less than anxious impatience.", "This film fizzes and pops - a blockbuster and a half - I would I were a teenager to be able to completely lose myself in its glory...I found it dull in parts - but that's because I'm an old git...as this film encapsulates what an adaptation of a comic should be - intense, fun, funny, inspiring and threatening. The ending is an unexpected treat and one Hollywood has been waiting for - those of us who watch all kinds of films know this kind of ending well and it's about time it featured in a blockbuster - so much so that I do feel many of these exceptional reviews are thanks to the ending...that said a great film and well above the usual fare! \nGo see", "It's mind blowing,amazing,thrilling movie.Specially i liked Thanos.Thank you MARVEL and Russo Brothers.I cant wait Part 2.", "Everything was leading up to this and it was mesmerizing", "Infinity war is awesome starlord and drax rocket and groot were so good . thor was the best no doubt.

Totally amazing movie. I can't wait for the next movie", "Even if you read the comics like I did, you won't be able to predict anything. The most unpredictable scene was when Peter Parker vanished (*not died) and I actually cried at that moment because,\n1) Tom Holland is a great actor and expresses the feeling really well. (He was realy good at playing the innocent little kid who just wanted to help his idol and also the dad figure)\n2) That father-son moment got me!\n3) Spider-man had always been my favorite superhero not only from MCU. The last thing I want to say is that this movie is not for only fans. My friend is not that interested in comics but she watched it without taking a breath.", "Nice movie , recommend it. I don't know what to write other than this.", "Im starting to say that I'm a DC fan boy, and I dont appreciate the MCU because of the \"Disney rules policy\" to interfere in every movie, but this movie went beyond far by my expectations, not what I was expecting, what a great surprise! Finally a MCU movie with great amazing villain, and the dark style story, the only movie in MCU that I loved (but I also loved the winter soldier).\nThanos was my favorite character in the movie, and in a MCU movie, WuAu!!\n \nThank you Russo brothers to not do a \"Disney\" kind movie, you take us to the other level. well done!", "Avengers Infinity War is the spectacular culmination of 18 previous movies over 10 years that exceeded my expectations! As someone who has followed the marvel universe since it's inception, I can say that this film successfully brings together an enormous cast, a remarkable story, twists that will keep you guessing, serious and gut-wrenching dramatic stakes, and an ending that left me both immensely satisfied and yearning for more at the same time! With a cast of this size, I was worried that the film would be confusing or bloated, but the directors jump from story to story in a way that is very easy to follow and each character gets at least one moment to shine! The antagonists of the majority of the previous entries in the marvel cinematic universe have been characters with no real deapth or motivations that don't entirely make sense, but the mad titan Thanos is quite the exception. Thanos sees himself as the hero of his own story and this movie does an excellent job of making the viewer understand why he does what he does and I empathize with him on some level. This movie has a lot of serious and emotional moments that would make sense for the most part if Avengers Infinty War was your first marvel cinematic universe film, but that being said, those moments are highlighted by context from previous entries in the series, and you would not have the same emotional payoffs you would if you possess at least a general knowledge of the marvel universe. Overall Avengers Infinity War is an excellent film that is not only impressive from its technical achievements, but also for, its superb cast and story that left me eager to see what will happens to earth's mightiest heroes!", "I honestly expected a lot, but assumed I was going to be disappointed. Somehow, they managed to do the impossible. Take ten years worth of characters and story and turn it into an epic movie. The best movie I have seen in theaters in years, and possibly the best PG-13 movie I have ever seen. Underrated by critics, easily a 10/10 and worth multiple viewings.", "I was so anxious and anticipatory of this movie that I bought tickets for it a month in advance. I couldn't wait to see the culmination of the various chess moves Marvel had been making over the last 10+ years. How could this movie be anything short of spectacular? OK, I'd be lying if I said it was spectacular but it was darn good. One of the biggest questions I had going in was how Marvel would showcase the numerous talents. How could they possibly give adequate screen time to the important characters such as Captain America, Thor, Iron-Man, Spider Man, Hulk, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy? Not to mention the secondary characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine and others. Then, what kind of villain... no, super-villain could Marvel cook up that would require the assembly of such talents? To the first question: I think they gave proper focus to the right characters. Some characters were more important than others and some had doper fight scenes than others (ahem, Iron Man, Spider Man, Doctor Strange) but they all got in on the action. To the second question: Thanos was not just a super villain, he was a super badass villain. He was so bad that even his henchmen could've been primary villains. Thanos was legendary status. He wasn't some amorphous super being, nor was he a science experiment gone wrong or just some very powerful maniac. Thanos was a force and his demeanor made him that much more sinister. He carried himself like he was destined for greatness and the steps to that greatness, however brutal, were just the necessary steps to get to where he needed to be. He was impressive to say the least. The movie was excellent even if it wasn't quite what I expected. We got to see some major upgrades from Iron Man and Spider Man. We got to see Avenger-like team work with cross-over characters. We got to see boss level heroism and self-sacrifice. \n We got to see major moral dilemmas. And we got to see an inter-galactic plot. If you haven't seen the movie then prepare yourself and don't be angry with all that happens just be patient because this movie is just one more brilliant chess move by the MCU.", "This movie was truly amazing, it had me crying,laughing and smiling. The plot was really good and in my opinion I think the best part of this movie is the bad guy thanos. His motives were actually good and he had the longest screen time which made it even better. The acting,writing,directing and action was jaw-dropping. Marvel really have done an amazing job on this one.", "First of all, Full marks for the action and CGI of the film. It was mesmerizing as always. The storyline is different than other Marvel movies, in this one, the Villain wins. Other than that, it's the same action adventure that other avenger movies are famous for.\nNow for the bad part, If you start making logical conclusions out of the script, there are a lot of loopholes and shortcomings. Firstly, No other government forces show up to fight against Thanos, in spite of Warmachine warning them of upcoming event and the reunion of Avengers. Do they not care enough to fight for their lives? Secondly, why does the army of wakanda has Spears and swords rather than guns. I did not watch the Black Panther movie, but when these people have flying cars and ultra sophisticated technology, did they miss out on inventing/using guns? Thirdly, Almost all the final stones that Thanos need are just handed over by the avengers or their allies. And they are trying at all to defend life in the universe? Lastly, the characters are emotionally weak, which eventually leads to their downfall. Starlord does it twice, once by not killing Gamora when she asks him to do so, and other by waking up Thanos when Avengers are about to remove the infinity gauntlet from him. Also, Dr. Strange turns out to be useless for the avengers, as he not only jeopardise the avengers plans, but also voluntarily gives away time stone, which he could have used to easily defeat Thanos.\nAll in all, if you are just looking for an avenger movie , then this certainly does not disappoint. However, if you are looking for the level of writing that is seen in the comic books, then this movie does makes the cut. I know for sure they are going to spin it somehow in the next marvel movie, but this movie as a standalone, is at best, mediocre.", "A beautiful balance of all the characters makes this movie enjoyable from start to finish. Haven't had my inner nerd come out like this since the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The ending leaves questions to be answered and is lacking emotionally in some places. How can we expect to believe these characters died when we know they have movies coming up in the near future? Such as Spider Man and Black Panther. Nevertheless, this movie was awesome.", "All I gotta say is, if you haven't seen GO!! This is one of the best Marvel movies made yet! Go, Go, Go!", "Totally worthy price of admission and the ten year build up. Marvel knows how to print money.", "I freaking watched this movie three times now, and it gets better everytime i watch it.

Disney and Marvel deserve the highest praise for what is undoubtedly the finest superhero movie ever made; both in its execution as a film, and its faithfulness to the original comicbook stories. The Russo Brothers have gracefully culminated a decade of stories and characters toward what is without a doubt the MCU's magnum opus. We are once again awestruck by a collection of heroes so vast that it seems nearly impossible for them all to get their shining moments in a relatively short 160 minutes. Surely at least a few must be passed over or shuffled along? No. Everyone, and I MEAN everyone (including a shocking return for a character long thought dead) is here. They are all given the time they so rightfully deserve, and it is achieved without the story feeling disjointed or rushed. I would not be at all surprised if there is a portion of the audience that is outraged at the ending (which I won't spoil for you here). It is, in the simplest terms possible, emotionally exhausting, especially if you have been a die hard MCU fan since 2008. Whereas other superhero stories have experimented with \"bittersweet\" endings, this one is simply bitter. But this is good. It means that Disney and Marvel respect the fans and the source materiel they are drawing upon. It means that they are willing to take risks, HUGE risks, for the sake of the saga they are in the midst of telling. They have enough regard for their fans that they are willing to allow them to feel sadness, simply because it is vital to the experience. This kind of integrity in storytelling is nothing short of admirable. Bravo, Disney/Marvel, bravo.", "Everyone thought that the first Avengers movie was something else. People thought that it was the best it was going to get. They were so amazed at the idea of a team up that contained not only one but many of the characters that they know and love.

As a fan of comic books and movies, I can safely say this was one of the most exceptional movie-going experiences of my life. Marvel not only matched my expectations for Infinity War, but they also exceeded it. Everything I thought I knew going in, would turn out to be wrong. Every prediction I made about life and death in this film-shattered. This is a movie that shouldn't work yet somehow it does. And what I mean by that is this: Avenger's: Infinity War raises the stakes to a crescendo and then walks away from it all without letting you fall gently. You are left to process your feelings, and Marvel doesn't care how you felt after it's over and done. That's bold. Secondly, no one...no one has ever been able to manage an ensemble quite like this. Reports are there are up to 70 Marvel characters in this film. Like seriously...who takes on this job as director?\nWell, thankfully it wasn't just one director. It was the powerhouse combo of Joe and Anthony Russo, and they deliver the best summer action flick in history! Hey James Cameron, as much as I admire your work, your opinion on Marvel movies sucks, and I pray they never end if they're going to make movies like this. Thanos, the mysterious villain that has stalked post-credit scenes (and a Guardians movie) for years, arrives on the scene with some issues of his own. And in his mind, his destructive goals will ultimately save the universe from itself, despite the costs. Thanos argues for the indefensible: genocide as a cure for the battle for resources. He believes this will bring peace to the universe. Well apparently, our heroes will not stand for this, and it sets up the battle to stop him from gaining the last few Infinity Stones. I'm not a huge fan of CGI characters in a movie, but Thanos works-thanks to Josh Brolin's calm and confident portrayal of the sometimes sentimental madman. This is a movie with some serious stakes, and that's hard to achieve in a film this weighty with characters because time devoted to dramatic impact is limited. But Marvel borrows the best of episodic TV and uses the emotional investment we already have with these characters to tear apart our heartstrings. In this film, the characters find themselves in unique pairings on separate missions, and wow...do these pairings work better than expected. Star-Lord, Dr. Strange, and Iron-Man. Let that sink in for a minute. Three of the most prominent egos in the Marvel universe--together. The interactions work better than imageable. The one-liners never cease, but it's never overly jokey. They know when to insert humor and when to get serious. And things get serious mid-way through thanks to some family drama. I was curious as to how well the Guardians would mess with our Earthbound heroes, but I got to say, that team delivers the heart to this CGI fest. The characters in this film are all given moments to shine. We revisit the fantastic world of Wakanda, and it's more glorious than ever before as we get to see the city's defense systems. Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine, Banner, and Bucky Barnes are all along for the ride, trying to protect Vision's infinity stone from Thanos. Hemsworth's Thor, without question, delivers one of the most crowd-pleasing entrances on film-judging by the roar from the crowd that was with me in attendance. And while it's hard to refer to any of our superheroes in this film as ancillary characters, know that the film focuses on three select groups of superheroes with each group having a few actors and actresses that claim more screen time than others. Scarlett Witch finally garners the screen time she deserves as the reluctant enhanced person with the power to save the world. Everyone and every action in this film have a purpose, which is why you care about the outcome of this film. This is what blockbuster movies are supposed to be. This is why going to theaters are still more impactful than watching them at home on your television or handheld device. The Avengers: Infinity War takes you on an exhilarating emotional journey that will leave you exhausted, heartbroken and clamor for the next installment in the series.", "In my opinion, it's my favorite superhero movie ever. Not because everybody was kung fu fighting, but because this movie means something. The Russo Brothers proved yet again that they can handle multiple characters in a movie and ups the ante by having almost 30 main characters, villain included. Speaking of villains, we know that Marvel had a bit of a problem with villains and their characterization. I mean, Obadiah Stane was fine in the first Iron Man movie, but subsequent villains since then were either undermined or fell flat on their face, except for Red Skull, Loki, Winter Soldier (antagonist, not villain), Alexander Pierce, Ego, Vulture, the Grandmaster, Hela and Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens. I'm very pleased to say Thanos is probably the most tragic out of all of them and easily the best since Killmonger. He's probably the best character in the whole movie, and that's no faint praise for a film featuring just about every MCU hero, yet get good to stellar characterization. You know he's a maniac, and yet you feel his pain and understand his motives (thank God they didn't stick with him wanting to impress a lady. That would've been stupid.) and his rationale. His world, Titan, wound up destroyed due to overpopulation, and even after he was declared mad after suggesting killing half the population, you can clearly see he wanted to save it. He wants to do that to the universe to avoid the same fate, so of course he needs to be stopped. Yet, the heroes fail. They failed. Thanos is a god now, even though it cost him \"everything\".  This film is indeed humorous, but overall it is emotional, which is a rarity for the MCU films that aren't directed by the Russos. But even this film is more emotional than Winter Soldier, Civil War and Black Panther combined. The Russos seem to have a perk for consequential endings, which is fine by me. But if there's one thing I've learned from this, it's a serious case of 'never trust a trailer', because i wasn't expecting that ending. Like, at all.  I mean, there was a lot of action in this movie, of course, but this movie focused more on the characters and the story rather than the action, and I'm so glad it did, because this time, I felt way more invested in the Avengers and Guardians more than ever before. This movie is proof that 10 years of buildup in the MCU was absolutely worth the payoff. I really haven't been this excited ever since I saw The Empire Strikes Back and that was 11 years ago. But at the same time, I really don't know what's gonna happen as of now. Marvel has made some pretty bold moves before, but the ending of Infinity War HAS to be the boldest.  2017 saw the deaths of Yondu Udonta in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Odin in Thor: Ragnarok. But 2018 is not off to a good start in the MCU, as Killmonger, Klaue and Zuri all died in Black Panther, but here, the majority of the heroes die. Lemme say that again, there were almost 30 characters at the beginning of this movie. At the end of it, only 8 are left, and they are Captain America, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, Rhodey, Thor, Okoye, Tony Stark and Nebula. And as of the casualties, which include Loki, Heimdall, Gamora, Vision (twice), Black Panther, Bucky, Wanda, Falcon, Groot, Mantis, Drax, Star-Lord, Doctor Strange and the most heartbreaking death on this list, Spider-Man.  As if that wasn't enough, the end credits sequence shows that Maria Hill and Nick Fury are among those casualties. The worst part of it when the deaths start after the snap? There's no music. At all. In relation to how I felt, as soon as the damage was done, Rhodes asks a mourning Steve Rogers what just happened. Rogers figures it out and says what most of the audience members were probably thinking: \"Oh, God...\"  I never thought that this film would ever kill that many characters, let alone a teenage Peter Parker, but they did, and I feel like this was our horrible reward for wanting the iconic snap so much. Overall, this is a very serious film that does have occasional moments of levity, but is far more consequential than any other MCU film and it succeeds at it's emotional storytelling, even if it does has a devastating ending. That being said, I can see some flaws within, like the characters and the runtime, but it's completely understandable. I noticed them too, but they're issues I've encountered multiple times in the MCU, and at this point, I've just come to accept it. When it all comes down to it in the end, which would you rather have to remember a film by: it's successes or it's failures? It's a concept that many have employed before and I'm no stranger to it. With superb storytelling and emotional stakes far beyond your usual Marvel movie and an ending that is sure to break many fans' hearts, Avengers: Infinity War is everything I wanted it to be and way more. It is by far my favorite superhero film ever and it truly is legendary. It's a definite 10/10 for me. If you are a Marvel/Marvel Cinematic Universe fan, a comic book/comic book movie fan or a superhero fan in general, I highly recommend this film. You won't regret it.", "From the very start of the movie, we can already feel the serious tone that marvel usually tries to avoid, from the beginning where no iconic MCU intro song was played (it was instead, replaced by a distress call as a continuation from Thor: Ragnarok's mid-credit scene) to the end where..... ummm... *SPOILER*, no wonder many fans were left scarred for (possibly) the rest of their lives (some of them even reported being passed out at the end of the movie lol). But not for me, on the contrary I'm Happy! I'm so happy that finally, FINALLY! A Superhero/Comicbook movie where, the bad guy that you know and love........................................WINS!!!!! Though not without great effort and sacrifices, which make the bad guy even more badass.  Thanos is easily the best and the greatest character in the movie, he is probably (and arguably) one of the greatest movie villain of all time (side-by-side with Darth Vader, if they decided to make infinity war saga into a trilogy like the original Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings). He's not that all-powerful like in the comics (which becomes one of my disappointments from the movie, in which I think that Thanos was not as powerful as Korath from the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie said when he consider him as the most powerful being in the universe without the gauntlet and the stones) he has feelings too, especially for Gamora. The difference of Thanos' motive in the movie from the comics actually disappoints me a little bit. The force of true and pure evil, violence, megalomania, destructive ambition, and absolute psychopathy suddenly turned into a well intentioned extremist. Another factor that downgrades the movie was the fact the last battle scene in Wakanda is not as long or as great as the battle of new york. It almost ends instantly the moment Thor arrived at the scene. The Outriders are not as formidable as the Chitauris with their laser guns, flying rovers, and the massive flying monsters (they are called Leviathans by the way) whereas the outriders only relies heavily on their savagery, claws, teeth, and blood-thirsty instinct like a massive horde of zombies. The Black Order aren't so great either, in which all four of them die in just this one movie where they are first introduced. So far, I enjoyed the movie more than almost anyone who needs therapist because they cannot accept some of their favorite characters turned to dust once Thanos' masterplan come to fruition. while they cried, I was like \"Oh yeahhh....!!!\" in complete happiness. I don't really care if some of them don't make it into the next phase of the MCU. In fact, I'm curious on how Marvel will try to produce the next 20 or so movies while half of their characters didn't even survived Infinity War. only time will tell the future of this astonishing and hell-of-a-ride cinematic adventure. will it ever stop, or, to paraphrase Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story, going infinity and beyond? you may never know.", "Avengers: Infinity War\nFilm review \nBy Nelson Nantanapibul\nDirected by Anthony and Joe Russo\nStarring: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Pratt, Josh Brolin...\n The MCU as it's known is 10 years old and has achieved massive financial and critical success which has culminated in the mother of all crossover events in Avengers: Infinity War. Now even though I admire the MCU and what it has accomplished (at least for me) not every film has hit it out of the park story wise and yet most of their films across the board seem to garner near identical critical praise with some rare exceptions. I loved the first Avengers film and saw it eight times in theaters during its original theatrical run. Age of Ultron fell far short of my expectations and in my opinion was their first major misstep narratively and yet that film still made over a billion dollars worldwide and appeared to be critic proof.\n Then Civil War came along helmed by the Russo Bros and and though it was billed as a Captain America film it was essentially The Avengers 2.5. I'm guessing that was a trial run for the Russos to see if they were worthy of taking over the next major chapter in the Avengers saga and they do not disappoint. \n Infinity War has the emotional depth that I find lacking in the majority of MCU films and they give us a villain in Thanos who is not only worthy enough to face off against earth's mightiest heroes but is the centerpiece of this film. This is his story all the way through with our heroes serving as the supporting cast. Most MCU villains are completely lackluster and quite frankly have not been all that interesting save for a few such as Loki, Red Skull and the Vulture. \n Thanos is billed as \"The Mad Titan\" in the comics but in Josh Brolin's performance he comes off as anything but. There is a method to Thanos' madness in the film and he (at least in his own mind) is the hero of this epic story. The best villains in cinema and literature are the ones who do not act purely out of evil intent but who feel as if what they are doing is just and cause and cannot understand why others cannot see things as they do. \n Thanos has a twisted sense of love and loyalty but he does possess those emotions and they are in full display in this film. Thanos is a fully realized character and has an arc in this film usually reserved for the heroes of the MCU. The Russos have taken the template of the MCU films which had started to become predictable and bland (at least for me) and completely do their own thing under the watchful eye of Kevin Feige to be sure. \nThis film is full of surprises and doesn't always go the way viewers expect it to and in one instance they kind of psyche you out in thinking one thing will happen and pull the rug out from under you. I cannot elaborate without spoiling what the scene is but it definitely had the audience at my screening audibly gasp out loud. For the first time in a long time I have actually felt like there were actual stakes in an MCU film where just about anything could happen and they set up those expectations from the get go. The Russos do not waste time in getting us into the action and they stomp their foot on the gas up until the very end. \nThis film had the usual brand of MCU style humor but didn't overstaurate the viewers with it the way I feel other films in the universe have begun to overly rely on it in lieu of character and plot development. The film also has great emotional depth and resonance that I have not felt within the MCU for a very long time. There were some moments in the film where I thought, I can't believe they actually went there. There was only one time in the film where I felt that they played it safe in terms of the fate of a character where if they had followed through on it would have really thrown viewers for a loop.\nMarvel has delivered something amazing with this film. The MCU could go in any direction from here on out. Actually if this were to be the last film in the MCU franchise (it's not) it would be a satisfying if somewhat dark and dreary way to end things but it could end. I highly recommend this film and what has been accomplished by the Fiege braintrust is nothing short of amazing and (almost) unheard of. The shared cinematic universe is not a new concept but it has not been accomplished on a scale of this size and it has yet to be successfully emulated by other studios. Definitely see this film and see how seamlessly the Russos intertwine so many characters together with Thanos serving as the thread that ties everything together from one scene to the next.", "Wow! This was amazing. I'm still racking my brain with what happened in this movie. The action was amazing. The plot was emotionally charged. And next to Black Panther, the best Marvel movie ever made.", "Just awesome seeing 10 years of universe build into one single movie, what a great time to be alive.", "Wow!! That movie was really awesome!!! I loved it !!!!", "What an absolute masterpiece of a film. After ten years of waiting, this delivered exactly what the audience were hoping for.  To start with, I LOVED how Thanos, the villain, is the main part of the film. It is basically a \"heist\" movie where Thanos is on a mission to get the Infinity Stones and The Avengers are the obstacles that he has to face. I thought that was a fantastic way of handling the movie. Hats off to you, Russo Brothers!  As the film goes on, you begin to understand Thanos' way of thinking when it comes to balancing the universe. His method, as villainous as it sounds, makes perfect sense! However, you know that it needs to be stopped. Yet, once you combine that with the number of years worth of support that you've given to The Avengers, you then begin to side with them more. The film is brilliant for making you know that the villain needs to be stopped but also for making you understand the villain's plan and why he's doing it.  The film is very fast paced so you need to keep up. However, it doesn't leave you hanging. If it leaves a scene open ended then don't worry because that scene will be concluded later on. That said, you begin to have a clear understanding of what each group of Avengers are doing when it comes to their own plans. It's sort of like sending three parties out to handle the situation differently. You have Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon etc defending the stone against Thanos. You then have Thor, Rocket Raccoon and Groot making a weapon to defeat Thanos. Finally, you have Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man etc bringing the fight to Thanos himself. Again, I LOVED how even though they were handling the situation differently, each plan was countered by Thanos and The Black Order. You finally get to see what you as an audience want to see (even though you admit you don't), which is The Avengers being conquered and going up against something way beyond them. The fight scenes were awesome and the character interactions and development was gripping, comical and interesting. I don't really have much more to say until I see it again as I'm still recovering from it! Marvel has excelled itself with this ballsy, funny, emotional and tense masterpiece. Infinity War will gain new audiences, satisfy big fans of the comic books and entertain every person who chooses to watch it.  Also, I'm so excited for the 4th film and the nod to Captain Marvel was a brilliant post-credit scene. Well done, Marvel! I have NO idea what is going to happen next!  I'm scared and also very excited!", "Then go see it again! It goes a o much beyond the hype.", "Went to see this in 3D IMAX, unfortunately we had some kids behind us that would not shut up and kept kicking our chairs.\nDepsite this, we still thought the movie was amazing, but had a nagging feeling we had missed parts somehow.\nSo, we went back the next day, this time in regular movie theater (though the biggest screen in the area). Firstly, have to say, 3D IMAX gave nothing to this movie, or any other movie i have seen in 3D IMAX for a while now. Done with 3D. Secondly, after watching it a second time, i believe this is a masterpiece of cinematic entertainment.\nHow everything comes together, how the characters are injected into the storyline at perfect moments of introduction, interactions and fight scenes, even the Thanos character development. All just brilliant. The crowd, was like being at a highly competitive soccer match, everyone screaming and applauding.", "Honestly the movie exceeded every expectation I had going in! It made me laugh, cry, almost jump out of my seat! The visuals in the movie are incredible as well, thanks to the top notch art direction! Movie definitely kept me on the edge for the whole thing!! Hats off to Marvel Studios and the whole crew for making an epic! Loved every second of it! Going to see it two more times this week!!", "Epic af, one of the best movies I've seen in a while.", "Constant excitement, questions and emotions. I left the theatre not knowing how to feel or what will happen next. Already starting the count down for part 2. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.", "The whole Marvel Movie train from Iron Man through Avengers Infinity War leaves you speechless after this one. Incredible that these movies could all lend to each other without taking away from one another or the characters but continue to build into an Epic showdown. I can't think of another series of movies with such an assortment of complex characters that has done this so flawlessly. George Lucas could learn a thing or two from Marvel. 10/10 and echoing the comments of another review \"The Best Super Hero Movie Ever Made!\" Perhaps the best Action/Sci-Fi movie ever made at that... If you haven't been watching then go back start with Iron Man (2008) and watch this series... binge it, then go see Avenger Infinity War as you won't be disappointed.", "So I'm not going to review infinity war into great detail, since as I'm writing this there's over 850 reviews, in a span of the movie being out for only 3 days, but I will say I'm a huge MARVEL fan. Bigger than you believe. The movie was near perfect. Probably ranked in my top 3 favorite comic book movies of all time. It was an emotional roller coaster, and it made me cry. And that's saying something since Logan didn't even make me cry. The visuals are amazing, The Black Order was amazing, one of the best part of the film. It's also crazy how much character development Thanos had in one film. The Russo brothers actually made me love him. And to conclude my review, I walked into the theater paying 20$ and walked out having to pay 300$ a week. If someone can send me Marvel's address and everything so I can bill them for my therapy sessions that would be great :) one more thing I would like everyone to stand 2 minutes in silence for our fallen cinematic universe; The DCEU, may they rest in peace.", "This film is definitely the best MCU film we have gotten so far (Spider-Man Homecoming is probably a close second). The film subverted a lot of superheroe cliches and opted for a more realistic portrayal. Sure, being a mainstream superhero film there is gonna be conventions and fan service but I think they didn't overstuff it with them. The humour mostly lands although there are some jokes that do fall flat (\"This is awkward\") but luckily they are few and far between. Thanos is the best villain yet since he has actual reasoning and motivation. Even if you don't agree with him you can still understand why he does what he does  I enjoyed the subplot with the Guardians which was the highlight. I honestly \nwouldn't be against Thor and the Guardians having a spin off movie and going on adventures. I think it would be entertaining. Thor constantly calling Rocket \"Rabbit\" was hilarious. While you do have great subplots like these other ones are not as interesting such as the Vison/Captain America storyline. This was uninteresting and I was waiting for it to get back to the Guardians or Peter Parker/Tony Stark storyline. Although the film's tonality is disjointed and always changing it's still manages to be consistent and cohesive. Although it can be quite jarring at times. The ending was great and shocking, for a mainstream superhero film to do this is commendable. Spider-Man's death nearly reduced me to tears, his line \"I don't wanna go\" is heartbreaking, awesome acting by Tom Holland. This film is great addition to the MCU and I hope we can expect similar or better films in the future.", "Despite the huge anticipation for the Goliath Infinity War is, one could enter the cinema plagued by the fear of traumatic directorial execution.  The Russos managed to pull off the feat of providing screen time to all our beloved heros and their storylines as well as bringing unexpected depth to the villain - I found myself flittering on the edge of agreeance with the big purple chap! Very entertaining and looking forward to 2019!", "I don't even like super hero movies, but this rocked. So much depth and emotion, along with amazing action. It's also genuinely hilarious.The whole audience was laughing out loud.  I'm now hooked and rewatching all the marvel movies! It's incredible how they tied every story together. 10 years in the making, and definitely worth the wait.", "Well it's an avengers' movie so the rate base has to be start at an 8 and all those superheroes are here with their coolest skills all in one movie, this is exciting. The images are great, the acting part is great, all the jokes from every marvel movies all comes together just make audience can't stop laughing. BUT. Admit it the logic of it is crap. I mean all avengers swore to protect lives in the whole universe that's why they are fighting the weird chin guy but somehow for the bad guy to win is simply threading their teammates? WHAT? Then what's all the efforts about?! I'm genuinely furious and speechless when they fought so hard after battle and battle then just cave 'alright mate I'll give you what you want but let him live'. They can come up with a better script than this ok? But after all it's a mind blowing film. I loved it, definitely gonna watch it agagin for all the fight scenes.", "Ever since Iron Man premiered in 2008, the MCU has been building up to this point, through thick and thin, through highs and lows, Infinity War was the climax of an encapsulating film franchise. Just saw the film, and I was absolutely blown away. This film is engaging, hilarious, suspenseful, emotional, and absolutely entertaining from beginning to end. It'll shock you, make you laugh, make you gasp, and make you tear up. Never in any movie has this big of a cast been so well utilized, with great chemistry and a great amount of character-driven humor. By far the best character in the movie was Thanos. With every tease and cameo in other MCU films, Thanos was built up as the greatest villain the heroes would ever face. He is menacing, commands a intimidating presence, and has an arc that makes him a complete and believable character among the others. Josh Brolin provided us with absolutely the greatest villain of the MCU. The stakes are high with the infinity stones as Thanos attempts to collect them all. With stakes as high as these, characters are sure to die! Not in the typical comic book film way, but as emotional and heart-breaking moments (No spoilers on who actually dies!) The Russo Brothers outdid themselves, continuing the MCU's unparalleled success of making engaging and entertaining flicks. Infinity War is by far the best of the MCU, proving once and for all, that comic book movies are here to stay for a very long time. Avengers Infinity War is incredible, absolutely at 10/10 film! (No spoilers in my review! Your welcome!)", "This is the best Film ever made! i am a Star Wars Fan but now i am a much bigger Avangers Fan! so many Special effects and SuperHeroes.... like a Dream!", "The beginning of the end, an imperfect, but certainly gratifying start for that final push.  An unprecedented cinematic journey ten years in the making and spanning the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel Studios' \"Avengers: Infinity War\" brings to the screen the ultimate, deadliest showdown of all time. The Avengers and their Super Hero allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe. So after seeing this film twice and now having a little bit of time to write this review, I'm able to spill the beans and finally get down pen to paper. If for some weird reason, anyone ends up reading this, there will be spoilers in here. I'm not going to focus on spoilers but they're going to end up being some of my main talking points. The reason I'm writing this so late is two-fold. One, I've been busy with my film shoot all weekend, despite finding time to watch this movie twice. Two, I've wanted to let my feelings and emotions settle down so that I could appropriately analyze this film and let the information soak in. Without further ado and years of anticipation, we have \"Avengers: Infinity War\".  One thing that I want to commend this film for is the writing and the insane, expectedly massive crew behind this film. With the list of credits alone, I would love to recognize everyone who put work into this film but there's just too many. For now, I want to give credit to the writers, along with the Russo brothers. It's a challenging task to write a story featuring one big name, but to feature a script with 70+ characters is absolutely insane. These are all the superheroes we've come to know and love with 10 years worth of story given to them. Here, we get to see them all collectively come together in one place and I can't even imagine how difficult it was to write something like this. It was amazing and they took on an ever so challenging task and I applaud them. Most people can recognize it, but most won't truly appreciate how difficult it is to write an ensemble of characters, especially one this big with a bunch of people we love and adore.  While we're on characters, everyone was fantastic! This film stars literally everyone and they did amazing. Some stand outs for me were Zoe Saldana's performance, as she gave a really powerful and emotional show as her character had strong connections to Thanos. I also thought this was the best I've seen of Chris Hemsworth, who went on his own little personal journey throughout the film. It's the most dimensional performance I've seen from him in any of the Marvel films total. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans both captured their respective leadership roles perfectly. Tom Holland stole the scenes as Spider-Man, and even Dave Bautista was a really underrated element of this film. Every single person here came together collectively all the way down the line and delivered something fantastic. Each and every single person represented the character that they've been played or just acquired so well and honestly, not a single one faltered in my eyes.  Thanos, thankfully, is the best Marvel villain we've ever had on screen. When I say that, I mean the best. Not once in Marvel history have we had a villain this powerful and scary that could truly challenge our heroes. I mean, come on, Thor is a god. Captain America and Bucky are essential super soldiers. Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Hulk are some of the smartest and strongest people alive. The team has assassins in Black Widow, Gamora, and Nebula. They have the support of so many more powers and even the support of a \"rabbit\" and a tree. The fact that it literally felt like Thanos was physically unstoppable went such a long way. He even had a deep, emotional side to him. I felt like I really was able to jump on board with his intentions and he was a great antagonist, both physically and mentally. He's the scariest villain we've had so far and Marvel's notoriously weak villains will definitely be forgotten when it comes to naming the best one yet, Thanos.  One thing I really loved about this film was just the emotional scale that it achieved. This is 10 years worth of story and life coming together here and even though I'm not the biggest Marvel fan, I'm amazed at all they've been able to do. This franchise started in a cave with Tony Stark creating a dingy, ghetto suit. It's now turned into all of this and it was such a privilege to be able to watch this film. Seeing everything and everybody come together for one collective thing was so awe-inspiring in my eyes. For the ending, it may not be the most cemented outcome but one thing's for certain, it was emotional. Seeing Thanos snap his fingers and half of the world dissipating away was one of the most powerfully charged moments in Marvel history for me. Seeing our beloved characters whither away hit so many heart strings for me and while I have a theory of what happened, I don't want to get into that. I just want to talk about how effective it was to see our heroes literally transform into dust and the world being left in chaos. This is the \"Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back\" that the Russo's have wanted to make. The world is in distraught and literally, more than half our heroes are gone.  This film was also visually stunning. I didn't love all of the camera work and the styles that the Russo's went with, but it was visually impressive. The CGI was top notch, the heroes all looked fantastic, Thanos was extremely detailed, and the landscapes were beautiful. This movie looked gorgeous and I definitely think it's one of the better looking Marvel films. There were some shots and moments that are still linger in my mind and it's certainly a good reason to watch this film alone.  In terms of problems that I had, this really is a prototypical, big blockbuster. This film, at its core, is comprised of two things. One, it's a film heavily centered on an abundance of thrilling action scenes. And two, it's a movie with a bunch of exposition and dialogue in between everything. The film started out extremely strong and it ended with a ginormous bang, but it kind of dragged in the middle. Yeah there's some really great, witty dialogue throughout and even some really well written lines, but in the end it is just exposition. If we're not in a thrilling action scene, we're getting exposition. And I totally get it. In this kind of thing, you have to have exposition, but it doesn't stray from the fact that it drags just a bit. Even with that being said, this film feels short and every time I've watched it, the time just flies by.  In the end, I really can't wait to see where Marvel takes this next. I want to keep guessing and assuming but I trust the the Russo brothers have a plan and that they'll take the necessary risks and choices that this franchise needs to do. I loved my experience here and it certainly lived up to everything I wanted it to be. It's nowhere near perfect and it's got its issues, which is why I can't rate it perfectly, but it was an amazing experience that I'm grateful to have had and I think they did an amazing job with this.", "Any Marvel fan will absolutely love this movie. My son says it's his new favorite of all-time. Not sure I'd go that far but certainly a great movie.", "Seen it twice in a weekend.\nTo say it's a game changer would be an understatement. Perfectly crafted, perfectly directed, perfect interactions (Thor and the Guardians were just made for each other) and the perfect Thanos. Have you ever had that emotion which has a ton of this and loads of that, with little amounts of this and a pinch of that and overall it's something you can't describe? Exhilaration, perfect and pure joy, heartbreaking sadness and anger with an overarching excitement that's more than you've ever felt before. That's what I felt in more than a word. It's an unparalleled achievement that more than surpasses its hype. It's more than you want and it leaves you wanting more. It's not the best Marvel movie because it can't be compared to the rest of them. It's more than that. It's an experience. You need to see it!", "This film is quite a blast the a film like this with so many character's should be bad but this film does it well you will have a damn good if you are a marvel fan but if you have not seen any of the other film's you won't like it.", "From start to finish, IW is going full speed ahead. Multiple storylines happening seamlessly.", "I will not provide any spoilers here, so you're welcome to read on. So where to start? \nThere's great comic moments, interspersed with some very tragic moments and the best action scenes I think I've ever seen in a film.  Josh Brolin is tremendous as the super villain, Thanos. You kind of half feel sorry for him, his voice coming across as someone hell bent on achieving the aim of collecting all the stones - almost as if it's his destiny and only way to achieve some sort of everlasting piece. There's times when he appears to show empathy and remorse yet still continues on his path.  If someone wants to flag that as a spoiler ^ that's fine. All I'll say is he is the best villain in any comic book movie, ever.  All of the other characters are fantastic, with particular mention to Dave Bautista for some of the funniest lines in the movie.  You will love it, hate it and most definitely will be hiding behind your hand on quite a few occasions.  Only 3 films I've seen are better: Shawshank, Inception and Dark Knight. That's how good this is!  I'll definitely be watching it a second time.  10/10.", "** Few spoilers ** It was best in its category, please don't compare this movie to the titles that are in other category...  Now:\nNot only it had emotional moments, where even Thanos felt sorry for killing Gamora at some point (which was unexcepted for me, because Thanos was mad titan in my sight, who loved to rule and only that), it offered one of the best CGI in history. Plot was great and it was greatly aligned from start to the end. \nKilling half of the universe was an epic moment... it left intrigue who and how will restore the order (hints on Cpt. Marvel), however fact that Hulk did not participate in battle was little bit of disappointing, but movie had enough smash even without hulk anyway Overall there was not any moment that had no influence in movie and it was a sci-fi movie, not detective to be unpredictable.... Plus, i don't get guys here writing that movie was boring and they felt asleep, it's their problem or maybe they are haters, because none of those guys provided any fact when the movie got boring.", "Everything a great movie should be! Action, humor, epic-ness(?), and leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for part 2!", "One of the best, if not, the best MCU film to date. I wanted to see as much of thanos as possible and get to know this character more and they delivered 10 times over. The visuals and conceptual art in this film is utterly incredible. Weta of course. This film nailed everything I wanted in this first instalment.", "Greatest Marvel movie ever I can wait to see Infinity war part 2", "The movie was fantastic, within the first 5 minutes the audience knew they were in for the long haul, it was spectacular. Usually, we expect credits that are comical but this one we just get a black screen with white credits. It was simply amazing from the fight scenes which were pretty much the whole time, but it also showed the dynamic ranges of the characters.", "I tried my best to not raise expectations with the combination of the 10 year buildup of movies and the audience anticipation of this movie, but I failed. My expectations were higher than some people will be on their fourth viewing of this movie trying to experience some new colours. While I failed in controlling my expectations, Avengers: Infinity War exceeded every one of them. The characters of 18 different movies with very different styles and tones were brought together with no property being sacrificed. Characters were combined in a number of creative ways, but they didn't waste every option in the first movie. Several Characters were left on the bench so we can have some fresh blood in part 2.  We all expected that not every character would make it out of this movie, but the who and the when were always up in the air. Those whose numbers came up, they were (for the most part) completely unexpected and came at times when I wasn't ready. Some are gone for good and will be missed moving forward into the next phase of the MCU. Others? Well, without giving anything away, I'm sure we will see some again. Can we all just remember that the Russo Brothers came up doing Sitcoms? These men wrote and directed some of the most creative (and fiercely underappreciated) TV comedy in Arrested Development and Community, among other things and they were brought up to take on some of the meatiest films in the MCU. I thought Marvel was crazy, and they were. Crazy like a Fox (which Disney also now owns). These men have set a bar that is going to be tough to surpass.  I advise everyone to go see this movie. Go and leave your comic book expectations at the door. A certain faction of comic fans are chomping at the bit to hate these movies because a different character says a line in the movie vs. the book and it is a tragedy. To the people who hated Lord of the Rings for the lack of Tom Bombadil, the people who hated the Last Jedi because Luke Skywalker had more tricks up his sleeve than when we last saw him in Episode VI (which by the way were all a part of the old Legends Material that they so wanted to be Canon), try hoping for the best and not combing the movie in search of the worst and you may just accidentally have a good time. Although, I expect that some of you would still be blown away.  I thank Marvel for the 18 movies that brought us to this point and for bringing them together in a way that I can only describe as a symphony. I look forward to what you plan on doing when this stage of the franchise's life has passed.", "Wow!What A Great and Incredible Movie This Is,It Is The Movie Most epic marvel movie ever,Great acting by all the actors in the movie especially Josh Brolin Playing Thanos,what an amazing portrayal of the character,The character is strongest,has an emotional feeling,feel love for her daughter Gamora,The CGI IS great,the story build up is great,The movie is just epic,fun,emotional and awesome,I feel honoured to watch this epic movie of all time", "Avengers: Infinity War does not disappoint. There are many serious and light-hearted scenes, yet they are timed perfectly as to not undermine the emotional impact of other scenes. Marvel holds nothing back, and no one is safe. The plot was fast paced and filled with action with brief moments of rest in between. Thanos is not your typical villain as he struggles with his own decisions. Overall, a very good film.", "Personally believe that all bad reviews are from people who were looking for a reason to hate it.. it's awesome and heartbreaking!!", "I am a marvel fan. I have seen all the movies several times. I know the lines by heart. I even grew up seen the tv shows and this movie was just too much for me. \nIt was perfect. \nThe chemistry between the characters is amazing, and the Russo brothers were able to make enough screen time for more than 20 characters. The fights are amazing and Thanos is just the greatest villain in the MCU by far.\nI loved every second of the movie... but that final was just wrong. That was not supposed to happen!!", "Avengers: Infinity War does an incredible job of melding together many storylines and characters into a beautifully intertwined story that's not even hard to follow. It does everything previous MCU movies have done, but on a much grander scale. The villain Thanos is especially compelling and has really done justice to all the times he's been hinted at since Avengers Assemble. This movie has it all - sci-fi, drama, fantasy, comedy, and action, so I'm sure all audiences will like something about it. The acting was pretty good across the board but since everyone had limited screen time (even in such a long movie!), what really stood out to me was the amazing visuals, and of course, the very long story arch finally coming near an end. The ending is also exceptional, but I won't speak much about that. Overall, I can't wait for the next ensemble movie and can't recommend this one enough.", "There was never a dull moment in this movie. It grabs your attention from the very beginning and leaves you begging for the next movie. It swirls you through every emotion, plenty of sad moments but finally the right amount of comedy in a marvel movie. The only down might be the predictability, yet it was that desired predictability. I don't think this movie could have improved in any way.", "Over the last 10 years, Marvel Studios has built their own cinematic universe through various movies, each one getting bigger and bigger and leading up to this very movie, \"Avengers: Infinity War\". It's a movie that was essentially 10 years in the making, and with all the buildup and hype through the years, the question remains: Does it live up to the hype and meet expectations? Not only does Infinity War do both, it also manages to be a breath of fresh air into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What Marvel has done with their cinematic universe over the past decade is nothing short of astounding. To be able to produce as many movies as they have and still keep the attention of the fans is a true example of good storytelling. The culmination of this good storytelling comes in the form of Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, which takes place after the events of 2016's \"Captain America: Civil War\", also directed by the Russo's. After their big fight with each other in that movie, the Avengers became a fractured, divided group. Some have even gone into hiding. However, they must put their differences aside for the sake of the universe when they learn of Thanos (Josh Brolin), who is seeking to collect the six infinity stones to have the power to wipe out half the universe, which he claims will bring balance to the universe. On the surface it seems like the typical Marvel superhero story, but there's something different here. This is darker and more bleak than pretty much any other Marvel movie. It goes places you wouldn't expect a Marvel movie to go to, and by doing so it feels unlike any other Marvel story before it. It also does a good job with keeping the viewer guessing what's coming next, and there are some twists and turns that leave the viewer always anticipating the next turn of events. In short, it's unpredictable, even all the way to its shocking ending. It's certainly a breath of fresh air when compared to the more traditional and predictable stories they have done recently. Kudos to Marvel for pulling all of this off. What's interesting about Infinity War is that while it is the biggest Marvel movie ever in terms of the amount of characters and its sheer scale, its story is a more personal one that also has its fair share of emotional moments. Many of the more personal and emotional moments involve the villain, Thanos, which was a smart move because it gives the viewer insight on why he does what he does and the sacrifices he has to make to accomplish what he sets out to do. It establishes him as more of a complex, fleshed-out character instead of just some big, dumb bad guy that's in it to cause havoc. It's what makes Thanos easily the best MCU villain yet. The writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely deserve major props for this. Although the story is dark, the movie has its fair share of humor that helps lighten the mood. While it's good to have humor, it can be a bad thing when there's too much of it at the wrong times, which tends to happen in Infinity War. There are a good amount of scenes, especially in the first half of the movie, where the humor would get in the way of the drama, which ended up getting a bit annoying because it would take away from the dramatic tension. The comedic scenes also tended to last a bit too long and drag on, especially during one scene involving the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor. It was an issue early on, but fortunately got better as the movie went on. As usual, the cast is great, with basically everyone returning from the previous movies. Whether it's Evans, Downey, Johansson, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, etc., it's always a joy to see these actors having fun with one another, and it helps that they have great chemistry with each other. Josh Brolin is also very good as Thanos through motion capture and voice over, and he helps make Thanos not only an intimidating villain, but just an all around good villain.  In short, Avengers: Infinity War is a thrilling and unpredictable journey that not only adds to Marvel's continuing success at the movies, but also raises the bar for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Infinity War is any sign of what's to come from Marvel in the future, then I can't wait to see what they have in store for us. Bring it on!", "After the slog that was Avengers: Age of Ultron, I was firmly convinced that Infinity War would follow in the same path - a boring, predictable, CGI-filled mess. But there is a reason why you should give all movies a chance. I thought the LEGO Movie looked stupid at first, but it was a welcome breath of fresh air. The same applies to Infinity War. Whether it's the acting, the story, or the surprise deaths of Gamora and the victory of Thanos, this movie firmly placed the MCU in cinema history. I felt this movie was stunning in its approach and felt that this movie restored my faith entirely in the MCU, especially with Black Panther. Also, the movie may be 149 minutes long, but they will fly by in this rollercoaster of a blockbuster. This movie \"only\" gets an 8 because the movie has too many characters, making it hard to follow. Also, the comedy felt a bit forced, especially away from the GotG parts. Despite those minor faults, this movie will certainly succeed in surprising and enthralling you - unless you've read this review.", "I worried I'd, in my mind, hyped this movie up too much. But it was the movie I needed! Brilliant ... fingers crossed the sequel Mensa all the damage Thanos has inflicted on the universe!", "There's little explanation needed for this movie, the incredible hype that this movie has generated is testament to that; however, if you really are coming into this movie with no clue as to what it is, firstly how big a rock are you under? Secondly, I would advise you turn back for now. This film is a culmination of the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe that has been developing for the past decade and it would be a waste to walk in to the theatre without previously immersing yourself into it. I know it sounds arduous but I truly feel that to fully appreciate what this movie has done, you need to familiarise yourself with the rest of the cinematic universe. So go, look up a viewing guide to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, buy a shedload of DVDs and set aside about 30 hours (phew!) of your time before you return. I'm assuming that I'm dealing with those of you that are familiar with the films at this point, and have no fear, there are no spoilers to be found here so you can read on without worry. There'll be those of you that have been swept up in the whirlwind of hype of Infinity War, and there will be those who are sceptical of the seemingly incredulous speeds that this whirlwind is reaching, I'll tell you now that I was a member of the latter group; the expectations for this movie were astronomical, but, against all odds, they were met. To my surprise, Avengers: Infinity War hit every note for me, the acting, the absolutely gorgeous spectacle (including some of the most riveting and inventive action sequences I have ever seen), meticulous and outrageous action, and the now-trademark Marvel comedy, it is not without mistakes but it hits when it counts and evidences a maturation of the wider cinematic universe, shedding the mistakes of the past in favour of a newer, realer tone that breaks free of the classic Marvel-mould. The two key issues I had found with previous entries were the poor execution of the main villains (think Thor: The Dark World) and the incessant comedic undercutting of sincere scenes (think Ragnarok). If these failures were keeping you anxious for this movie, know that they are largely fixed, the comedic tone is still finding that balance but is well-dispensed for the majority of the movie (and is nowhere near as distracting as it was in Ragnarok). The sincerity of this movie is well-used and certain scenes had left me a little misty-eyed, the raw emotion in this film was a welcome surprise. The second gripe, development of the main villains, is the greatest success of this movie, a great deal of time is put into ensuring that the stereotypical big-bad isn't just a stereotypical big-bad, instead his perspective is presented to you in an almost sympathetic way; perhaps you won't agree with his aims, but you understand them, and that's a first for the Marvel movies and is something that should be celebrated because it was achieved with great success. Infinity War has accomplished a fantastic feat in the biggest crossover event in cinematic history, almost all of your favourite heroes will all feature here, all given respectable screen-time in their own subplots (of which there are many) before crossing paths with each other. It is a joy to see the immense cast that Marvel have been building for the past 10 years quip and bicker together as they face almost impossible odds as one. This summer blockbuster of epic proportions is not one to be missed and is a love-letter to the hordes of fans who have persevered since the beginning of Marvel-mania in 2008.", "Avengers: Infinity War is a movie unlike any other I have ever seen.\nNever miss watching this one.\nCant be descried just by words but its one of the best movies there is.\nEverything perfect from direction to soundtrack to action scenes.\nWith completely great story.\nAnd a Ending unseen ever and Mind Blowing", "Leaves you cold and with question just like when Jon Snow died. Now we have to until the next movie to figure out if all our heroes died for real or will return back.", "Avengers infinity waa is good watch film.. And the super heroes demise was sad.. we miss them.\nBut coming to the film, the movie is very good in its extraordinary taking as well as the cat performance. More over the technical expertise wow awesome.. superb movie overall.. should wait for the second part til next year...", "I never write reviews, ever! And I've never been an avid superhero fan, but this is something else. It has everything you could ever want from a film. It is a hell of 2 hour ride with so many emotions. I won't say anything about the plot as would hate to spoil it for anyone. If you only see one film at the cinema this year, then make sure it's this!", "This is a spoiler free review. The film starts where Thor Ragnarok left off with the heroes confronting Thanos et al in a brief but well balanced scene setting the tone for the entire movie. There is great action throughout with the main plot of the film being extremely simple, the collection of the Infinity Stones to conclude Thanos's vision of the universe based on his warped interpretation - kill a few to save a lot, mentality. The pacing is great from start to finish and there are many wonderful moments to get your head around including some sadness which are all we placed. The humour is similar in tone to Thor Ragnarok but seem toned down when balanced out by the sad parts of the film. Infinity War ends, as one would expect from a two part film on a shocking cliff hanger and I for one can't wait for part two!", "Action from start to finish, with characters killed off left, right and centre. The finale leaves me wanting more, along with notable admissions and teasers leaving me wanting to see the up and coming Marvel releases even more than I did as well!", "I was simply amazed by this movie and it had nothing to do with my low expectations caused by Age of Ultron or Ragnarok. The action starts in the first minutes and ends just before the credits roll up. Really good plot and even better characters. Like, they have made 3 Thor movies and the coolest Thor you will ever see is in this movie. Thanos is by far the best villain I have seen in any super-hero movie (MCU and DC). Just joking, no one will be better than Nolan's Joker :). But better than any villain MCU developed so far. My only regret is that Infinity War 2 didn't started right away, right there in the cinema. We'll have to wait one more year for that and I have a feeling that will be at least as good as this one. If you spend money in the past for Ant-Man, GOTG2 or any other slightly meaningless Marvel movie and think about skipping this one, trust me, you will regret it.  You have to see this movie as soon as possible.", "Just massive and breathtaking and so good. Little tiny knit-picking problems here and there but they just took 18 movies to lead up to one big one and it's as epic as it should be.", "Marvel has done it again! Similar to Capt. Civil War and the Winter Soldier, again, the Russo Brothers have managed to deliver such an amazing superhero movie with great performances from an all star cast, well done CGI/visual FX, and an incredible storyline with hardly any plot holes or twists! The characters were loveable and awesome, the action scenes were so COOL, the fights were epic, the sad scenes triggered with my emotions, funny scenes were hilarious, and Thanos was the perfect villain, probably making him my favorite comic book villain since Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Night! I can't wait for Avengers 4 next year!!! I want more!!!", "The anticipation has been building for years. The ultimate baddie, Thanos, who has remained in the shadows, is coming to earth the get the five Infinity Stones that would give him the power to destroy half of the universe with one snap of his fingers. With the current Avengers disbanded, after the events of \"Age of Ultron\" and \"Civil War\", they weren't exactly prepared for a foe like Thanos. \nTo avoid any spoilers, I will leave the plot details at that. \n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" really packs a punch. It's relentless action and quick (and often witty) dialogue keep the two and half hour movie rolling without slowing down for you to relax or, at times, really process what just happened. To balance all the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters, and subplots, was a feat in and of itself. I applaud the Russo Brothers (who also directed \"Winter Soldier\" and \"Civil War\") for taking on such a daunting task and succeeding in keeping us engaged while giving the primary Avengers, as well as The Guardians of the Galaxy, their own moments to shine. \nBut this movie isn't really their movie. It's all Thanos, played by Josh Brolin buried under CGI to make him look more monster than man. But he finds a way to emote and make his character more than just another big baddie without a soul. \nThe movie isn't perfect. There are a few CGI moments, mostly of Thanos, that looked like they needed more time to finish. And it's cliffhanger ending (the untitled \"part two\" will release May of next year) left me feeling numb and somewhat unsatisfied. But be sure to stay for the post-credits scene. It's worth the wait.", "Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Captain America (Chris Evans). Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Spider-Man (Tom Holland).

Thanos (Josh Brolin) is coming, and it's going to take all of these heroes (and more!) to take him and his Black Order down before he can retrieve all of the infinity stones and bring \"balance\" to the universe through mass genocide.

I am guessing that Spiderman, Black Panther , And all the Guardians of the galaxy (except Gamora) will all come back and probably most of the people that Thanos 'killed' when he snapped his fingers because they have movies that are anounced to come in the future", "Going in to this film I was already a massive fan of the movies that had come before it. I had been introduced to characters I knew such as Captain America and Iron Man, characters I've never heard of like The Guardians of the Galaxy and reimagined characters in this cinematic universe such as Spider-Man. Though a couple of these films may have had flaws (Iron Man 2 for example) they have all been building up to this movie and my God have they pulled it off and more. This film is fantastic and easily one of the best if not best superhero movies released. I have been asked how it compares to Christopher Nolans 'The Dark Knight' and they are two different beasts. One is a superb crime drama with super hero elements and the other every comic book fans dream of a superhero mashup! From the first minute to the last your eyes are hooked, there is not one dull moment as it each fantastic action scene is filled between with tense moments. Each actor plays their roles to a level where you can't see anyone else being these characters. When Spider-Man appeared on screen I became I 10 year old kid again watching the cartoons, you are just swallowed by the film and when they film ended silence fell in my cinema except for a few gasps from the crowd, me personally I had no words for what I had just seen. I laughed at the funny moments, on edge of my seat at the dramatic ones and teared up when the film decided to go on an all out attack on my feels (one moment in particular killed me). All I know is when the film ends I said to a friend that the next film will make more than this one based on the fact you NEED to see the next film. One thing I did say is DC have the Joker Marvel have Thanos. I was absolutely blown away by the villain in this film and put him up there as one of the great movie villain in recent cinematic history, this film is more his movie than the avengers and I was impressed with how complex they made his character. To close, there is hype and then there's this. It takes superhero movies to the next level and I love DC, but after this film it just showed that there is no competition anymore. There wasnt one to begin with either tbh.\nI will enjoy what DC bring to the table... but Marvel have that special recipe nailed.

Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos (Josh Brolin) work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains. The stakes are so real, the charisma levels are amazing !", "Everything about Marvel's latest addition in its sprawling, epic MCU franchise feels overwhelmingly massive. Boasting the largest cast of any Marvel movie yet, a storyline on a colossal scale and a supervillain finally getting his chance to step forth into the limelight, Avengers: Infinity War has much to live up to. Since its genesis in 2008 with Iron Man, the MCU has been thriving for an impressive ten years, continuously expanding and, for better or for worse, birthing the term 'cinematic universe'. Thanos (Josh Brolin) searches high and low across the universe to complete his collection of infinity stones. Once all have been retrieved and inserted into his golden gauntlet, he will be granted world dominating power and become an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction. With so much at stake, the Avengers, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy and various other superheroes including Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), must unite to defeat Thanos before their world is torn apart. \nAs much as I was anticipating Infinity War, I was also anxious due to the sheer weight of it all. Sure, the geeky fanboy in me was psyched to see such an ensemble, but there was still the fear that the film would feel too overcrowded. Thankfully, the Russo brothers pull it off with such grandeur, resulting in one of the very best Marvel films yet.  Firstly, Thanos is without a doubt the best villain this franchise has brought into the fold. Marvel is known for its villain problem, only offering a small handful of memorable antagonists such as Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Ultron (James Spader), but the Russo's quickly establish Thanos to be the most threatening force to be reckoned with within the films opening ten minutes. Convincing villains are difficult to write, but for all his evil and destructive nature, Thanos is given an emotional depth that is sourly lacking in many villains these days, in both comic books and movies. In many ways, the film feels like it belongs to Thanos himself. As they've already proven in The Winter Soldier (2014) and Civil War (2016), the Russo's know how to present their audience with stellar action sequences, and Infinity War's action is just as brilliant. It's a breathless spectacle to witness, and it never relies too heavily on shaky cam, resulting in clear cut action sequences that never feel strenuous to keep up with.  One of the most notable things about the film is its collision of various voices. Throughout the MCU, multiple directors have made their mark on the franchise. James Gunn's wonderful Guardians of the Galaxy films are known for their colourful, upbeat tempo's and infectious soundtracks, whilst the first two Thor movies are rooted more within the dark fantasy genre, particularly it's sequel. Understanding this, the Russo's manage to incorporate all these unique voices into one movie to ensure every character is portrayed as accurately as possible according to their respective solo outings. Throughout the films heavier moments, the Russo's never forget to incorporate humour into the mix to prevent it being 100% doom and gloom. With so many characters to juggle, there are a handful of heroes who don't get as much screen time as they deserve, and a side mission involving Thor (Hemsworth) isn't as engaging as the rest of the film, yet it never drags the film down completely. It's difficult to dive too deep into the film without giving away any spoilers. What I will say is that Marvel are finally beginning to take risks with their storytelling. The stakes have never been higher, and Infinity War is without a doubt one the most exhausting and exhilarating chapters in the MCU. Bombastically ambitious, bursting with action and emotion as well as a jaw dropping finale that will leave you feeling somewhat cold, Infinity War is truly spectacular and the perfect film to celebrate ten years of the MCU.", "The film was a perfect film in every direction this year's movie.", "Simply blown away by how well made this is. It keeps the sustain through out the movie and you still want more because it's just never enough ! We all know how it would end to this, but we still got surprised anyway ! Definitely worth the hype, just...please don't miss this. You will missed the greatest movie of all time (at least until the next one) MCU the best !!!", "10 years, 19 films, 15 billion dollars and a huge fanbase composed of an extremely homogeneous audience of women, men, children, teenagers, adults and the elderly; In short, Marvel with its MCU has created an unprecedented film phenomenon that seems not to want to decrease but instead does nothing but expand more and more from year to year, especially in the American and world box office where it continues to break records on records so much to create almost an economic monopoly while the DC counterpart, as much as I appreciate it, remains helpless to look with great envy.\nAll this immense work to get to this point, to get to this huge, impressive and epic, as well as exciting, dark and, however difficult it may seem, even deep film; all this to get to \"Avengers: Infinity War\".\nA waited film, as already mentioned, for ten years and a huge number of fans and not only, which had the task of being able to bring together all the Marvel superheroes so far cinematically known, to link the various films, to give a species of conclusion, which will then be more concretized in the fourth, to this complex scheme that is the expanded Marvel universe, and above all to succeed, at least, to satisfy the great expectations that have grown together with this universe.\nTo do all this, Joss When, after creating \"Avengers\" and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\", is replaced by two brothers, Joe and Anthony Russo, former directors of the last two chapters of the trilogy dedicated to Steve Rogers aka Captain America, \"Captain America: the Winter Soldier\" and \"Captain America: Civil War.\nThe two directors have managed to give the film a heart and a soul, you can perceive in each frame, sequence and dialogue the love on their part and of each of the actors in the film that have invested in this project and, above all in this movie.\nThey also managed to give to Infinity War probably what really distinguished this to all the other Marvel films, that is an almost perfect villain, Thanos, a villain who does not believe in his ego to be such because he is motivated by a real, tangible and understandable motivation, a villain who is able to experience feelings beyond anger and desire for destruction, a villain with whom the spectator almost manages to tie because as immoral and ruthless as he may be it is also almost understandable, a villain that has not only the characteristic to be such but that has different facets, different nuances and different reasons that push he, almost against his will, to be such, in short an extremely complex villain, characterized in an exemplary manner and that marks a real strength and turn to the internal of the MCU; if there is something missing in each of the previous films that are part of this universe is the presence of a great bad guy, absolutely not flat or forgettable but that proves a real challenge for heroes protagonists.\nIt is also interpreted with great credibility by an extraordinary Josh Brolin, which we will see soon also in the role of Cable in the sequel to Deadpool, who immerses himself totally in the character and manages to be worthy of his intense and really complicated role.\nThe Russo also impress the audience with a balanced and well calibrated alternation of ironic moments with others darker, of moments more emotional and moving with others more sensational and with a strong visual impact. They also succeeded in giving the right time to each character, perhaps one of the most difficult tasks given the large number of them and the duration of \"just\" two and a half hours.\nBasically they managed to make a film not difficult to work, almost impossible to achieve, they did a job that will enter, if it has not already done, in the history of cinema, which will be studied in film schools and will act as an example for many others movie.\nNothing of this film is not in the right place or does not work, especially if considered the technical aspect that really turns out to be a real triumph: extraordinary special effects, extremely credible and realistic despite their abundant amount, especially in the realization of Thanos give the best of themselves; a direction, as already said, impeccable; an extremely suggestive and exciting cinematography, with truly sensational colors; an incisive, noisy, perfectly contextualized soundtrack that gives the right tone and the right atmosphere to the whole film; and a perfect editing in every sequence.\nAn unforgettable film, impossible for a fan to see objectively because it touches the emotions that have formed over the past ten years, an immense, extreme, epic film and I could continue for many lines giving it the best compliments for a blockbusters of this size. \nBut above all for me is a film that has managed to awaken in me that great fan who grew up with this universe and that in recent films was lost because demoralized by the repetition and the stalemate created inside the MCU, they aren't bad movies, especially the last \"Black Panther\" but that were beginning to repeat itself in the structure and in the plot. So I can only be more than happy with this \"Avengers: Infinity War\", a film that has everything that was missing in the other Marvel movies.", "Best movie ever!! The actors are amazing! But it was so annoying that Banner couldn't became hulk. And the ending was so sad...", "Simply the best movie I've ever seen!! Need to watch it at least 4 more times!", "Wasn't the best marvel movie but still very enjoyable to watch. Was better than black panther though which only got great reviews from critics bc of diversity.", "Don't ask anyone about the movie before you see it!", "Avengers - Infinity War-Marvel(lous) Movie -\nMy review\nFirstly for Superheroes movies - there are minimum 2 kinds of audience\n1. One who have read those comics and have high anticipation of the characters\n2. One who have watched the movies but not the comics, yet have high expectation of the movie\nAnd maybe a bit of both...\nRegardless this movie was a Highly anticipated, Awaited, High expectation movie for the Super hero genre.\nSo how does it stand?\nDo read on...\nFor the record I belong to the 1 type audience, I grew up reading the super hero comics- both of Marvel and Dc so I am aware of the power and the character of the heroes.\nThe review is strictly of Marvel - characters of this movie.\nTo begin== A kickass- Blockbuster movie\nLike I always mention a Super hero is made a hero based on the villain and the tasks that they undertake and accomplish.\nThe villain has to be good and strong. \nDoes the Villain - have that impact- a strong YES, an exceeding expectation characterization of 'Thanos' as the villain.\nAll the trailers have not let down the character of Thanos in the movie.\nHe is a Granddaddy of all super villains- thus far. Exceeding expectation of the villain role. He is impeccable and portrayed as a super villain to perfection. No flaw in his characterization. \nPerfect fit a Super villain? >> \nDoes the movie have flaw/cons - Yes, but do they impact the outcome of the movie - No Sir, The flaws are at minimum to negligible - only if you strictly try to find them, will they feel so. To the story. Before that I, marvel the manner in which Marvel studios have linked up all their superhero movies and those who have watched the earlier movies can co relate to that I am talking about.\nThe story- it begins from where it was left (Thor -Ragnarok) . No spoilers here of the story as the trailers are clear of what Thanos is all about and the rest of the story is how the heroes fight/defend..There is no point talking of the story as that is the least of the concern. What is most important is the number of heroes and their characterization,\nThe movie requires 20 + heroes( got this from some updates on net... I was to engrossed to count) to fight him. That says a lot of the power of the Villian.\nDoes this lessen the role of heroes? No- Each character was given sufficient role and every character played their part to perfection.\nThe Visualization are visual treat. The video format was in Imax and it was amazing. \nWhat was surprising was the audience reaction in the theatres. The audience was vocal, emotional, reactive to the scenes on the screen, I saw them gawking, cheering, whistling , cussing at villains, and literally jumping off the seats at an exciting hero event. And this reaction is not of kids, but Adults.\nThis shows how much the characters have an impact on the audience and how much they are involved.\nThere are some jaw-opening, mind blowing situations that HAS to viewed and experienced in the cinema.  Reading comics and watching the characters come alive on screen is a huge thing. In comics it is not that hard as it is all drawing and it is upto the reader who understand and get involved. But on screen you are stuck with the characters and their interaction and their reaction that is what is the essence that makes you glued to your seats and Marvel has done it to perfection. You can feel and anticipate the chemistry/the intensity when the characters face each other and feel as if they are the real characters.\nAny cons of the heroes - minor - find that toward the end. Pros - everything about the movie, the anticipation, the excitement, the breath taking visualizations, the characters, the actions, the sound, the imax affect . The movie leaves you with a Deja vu effect that would last even after you come out of the movie. \nI hated the movie to end.\nIt is amazing that inspite of this movie being a super serious movie, Marvel directors were able to include pinch of humor in between.\nThor was \nCons= The movie should have been longer and that would add more action (wink, wink)\nLike I mentioned there are few flaws/cons. That I should also mention.\nThanos seems to have got more time on the movie, I personally would have preferred if that time was spared for a hero. But I guess that was needed to portray the 'Thanos' character.\nThe characters of Vision and Hulk were not fully utilized to the potential that they could. But then that does not have huge impact as the story keeps moving up.\nThe part of restoring a weapon to Thor and the part of restoring the eye was bit overdone maybe something could have been done better - but trust me even if you watch it after reading this review it would not affect the outcome. \nTony Stark(Robert Downey jr) maybe getting a bit old as the age shows up.. but no impact as I don't think anyone would want that character to be replaced.\nTo summarize\nWhat do you want to watch a movie for? To get the bang of it, the money worth. And becoming a fan of the characters. I am positive you would love one or the other characters of the movie.\nAll this and more is what Avengers is all About\nWhat are you waiting for- Go watch it Imax. I will watch it again.\nSo what is the final take-- This is a Daddy of all Super hero movies. A kick ass movie- Worth watching in Imax.", "This movie is a conclusion of all marvel cinematic universes movie in the past 10 years and its put it all together very well, but not very neat. It put the heroes on various moment that we can't correlate with. As we know, the main villain, Thanos is a fanatic on his own belief and He tried to make a religion out of this, put his ambition all over the universe whom he believes is the best choice that universe would ever have. But I fail to connect to what Thanos belief, as a good villain must convince what he's doing is probably the best choice for the audience. In the past movie, we don't know Thanos true intention to collect all the rocks for but we know that he is very powerful and his reason must be as powerful as he is, turns out its just incomprehensible obsession over balance.\nOne thing that felt weird is when Rocket and Groot easily join Thor on his quest considering Rocket's skeptical view on people. It's also strange when the rest GotG flew to Knowhere and trying to stop Thanos while Thor, Rocket, and Groot go on their side quest to create a mighty weapon to destroy Thanos, It's like the Quill's team would face a predestined lost. But to everyone who said that Thor's hammer is freakin' cool, I must agree.\nOn the other side of the fight, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, and Spider-Man is a great collaboration of fun and glorious fight. The way Doctor Strange fought with his magic is pretty cool and it's like he always has some trick to confuse Thanos while an iron man and spiderman showed their father to son debate which makes a bit of fun on the pretentious moment. \nThe fight in Wakanda took a lot of heroes but very little exposure of all of them. It's like when all the triumph moment come it always gone quickly, moving to another main character's scene, I don't feel the fight was set on the Wakanda, it's like the director just changes the scene madly to show the heroes. The plot doesn't make any straight line conclusion, Thanos seems like a confused guy trying to get all his toys, and why the hell Thor just farming on Thanos's crazy monsters not just directly confront him as he always wanted to do in the first place and the main reason he crafted his new weapon.\nThe biggest wasted potential on this movie is Hulk. Before I see this movie, I think the only guy that would be able to defeat Thanos is the Hulk. But when he's beaten on the Asgardian's ship, I hope that he will get angrier and make an epic comeback on Thanos, even if he's not gonna defeat him, I expect that there is an epic moment of Hulk beating Thanos.\nOn the end of the movie, the conclusion is not what I expected, but the result is. The story left me nothing to expect on the next movies, so when the movie ended I felt no insurmountable urge to watch the next, it's because the ending of the movie is just like the ending of the Avengers movie.There's no one taken any hostages, no one alive to fight for, and the villain is retired on his tropical hut. The possibility of the next movie all about is as the title of the movie, to avenge, and this time for the dead one.\nOne thing I felt missing in this movie, the triumph song, it's like the immigrant song on thor Ragnarok and African black panther's theme song. There are a lot of cool moments and if it guided with a compatible back sound, It will bring more ardor to the scene, but instead, it's only a flat monotonous back sound that I may say is the secondary storyteller, besides the scene.\nI must appreciate how Russo brothers put the details very neatly despite a great deal of character and story to take care of. And respect given from me to the director when they could still maintain all the characters sways and jokes and made me feel a little bit nostalgic feeling of the past movies and a brief moment of clarity of how big this movie is.\nSome people may expect more from this movie, but I can't see another way to feel enjoy the character in any other way. This movie brings the characters personally as it brings all the character as a team. They put the movie on tight chess game with some sacrifice and some winning, making an unexpected move while making sure the ending is inevitable. And I believe for the next movie, the remaining characters won't go easy on Thanos. The Avengers will avenge. That's what they do best.", "Best avengers movie - slightly edged Ragnarok. The whole movie was action and comedy through amazing display of heroes. Amazing", "I love Avanger Infinity war 2018 movie. i love that kind of movie", "One of the best marvel films they've made, its got me desperately needing to see No4, so many shocking moments at the end, just brilliant", "Wow. I left Avengers: Infinity War SHOOK. The Russo Brothers did it, it's probably one of the best Marvel Movies. Avengers: Infinity War is one of the few movies that made me wanting to see it TWICE. The tone of the movie is very dark, it's an intense movie and deserves to be seen in IMAX 3D, the format I saw it in. This movie blew me away, the music is epic and gorgeous, the CGI is fantastic, Josh Brolin is also fantastic as Thanos, he is very evil but also has something behind him. It's a great movie, I highly recommend it.", "Such an exquisite master piece! Every moment was great and the ending was perfect! It really added a new element of film in which we have yet to see in the MCU. When it comes to villains, Thanos is definitely on the stronger side. He creates a mysteriously convincing character which some how, makes you empathise with him which no villain has ever done before with me!", "Though all marvel films up to this point have been entertaining crowd pleasers this one took lots of risks and had many permanent consequences. Something that I personally have been wanting from these marvel movies for a long time. Though it is far from perfect, it's flaws can easily be over looked.", "(spoiler free)\nI've only become a Marvel fan over the last couple of years, and boy was I hyped for this movie. A small part of me was still worried that it wouldn't be as good as I'd hoped (*cough* The Force Awakens *cough*). However, I left the cinema shell shocked. It was as great a movie as I could have ever hoped for.  The basic plot is well known already: Thanos is trying to collect the six infinity stones so he can wield ultimate power. It's up to the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him. And that's really all you should need to know to go and watch it yourself.  The pace is unrelenting; there wasn't any time wasted. Everything kept moving the plot forward and it never became boring. Scenes with Thor and the Guardians were some of the funniest; they played off each other very well. And almost unbelievably, Thanos was a somewhat sympathetic villain (which I was sure beforehand that they wouldn't be able to do)! I don't agree with him personally of course, but can at least understand where he's coming from. One of the criticisms I've seen was that there wasn't enough character development and this is very much unjustified in my view. Why? Well for one, when you have 20+ characters we've come to know and love, having individual character arcs would be completely impossible and frankly boring. Two, we've already had all the movies *before* to build up the characters! This is a crossover movie; we don't need to see all that. Three, there was enough of it for some of the characters, and I felt that there was a lot of depth to them, particularly in some of the more emotional scenes. If you're one of the snobby film critics who thinks they're too good for superhero movies then don't bother. Stay at home and enjoy your movies about women falling in love with fish-men. But if you're still in touch with your inner child and want to have a great time escaping to another world for 2\u00bd hours, I heartily recommend you watch this.", "I will never give a Marvel movie a 10 out of 10 rating, no matter how much I like or love or enjoy it because that would go against the whole premise of perfectness that a complete a 100% approval ratings signify. Marvel movies are not perfect and even more so they have a lot of help and leeway in terms of their history, background and casting that not a lot of other franchises can boast of. Nonetheless, Infinity War the movie is perhaps the best movie of Marvel I and in consensus, most of the other people have ever seen. What sets M's IW apart from any of it's predecessors and relatives of the same family tree? Nobody has had the opportunity to learn from 18 previous releases, for one, which is major identifier to the causality of the successful destiny that has arrived for it unlike DC's Justice League movie from last year, which wanted to do too much ala Marvel in too less time non-ala Marvel. The worse part of it all was that it was that even failed to put forward a coherent movie that made some trails about making you feel you didn't waste you money and/or time. Anyways departing from the tragedies of Snyder and quickfixes of Whedon, let's talk about a darker MCEU which is second reason of what set IW apart and primary reason why I hated the generic Marvel humor (Read effing Bruce Banner all over the movie) so unnecessary. I mean people die here. Well, people die everywhere almost and especially in these movie franchises when the cameras are zoomed out and thousands, if not millions, are at risk from the catastrophic proportions of devastation that is brought about encounters between supernatural entities again and again, much to the bother of the people who keep tabs on the Sokovian Accords. So, characters in the movies you actually might care about die (you can count them as the number of fingers on one of your hands but for Marvels, that is a lot) and then there is the matter of Infinity Debacle. This movie is made shock and awe you at every turn of the frame and passing of minute. And judging by my personal elation when I watched it on 28th April and that of the theater audience, I am quite sure Kevin Feige and his identical bro-balls named the Russo brothers succeeded. I admire this movie a lot for one particular reason and it is that despite how predictable how it was to be and how much you could extrapolate from the general arcs, you really still pretty much get invested and surprised by what it has to offer.\n1) You know the stakes are high and people may die. But the emotional investment and disbelief of the actual scenarios still would actually silence whole crowds because of their nature and what Marvel has come to be. Which is all the more the Feige and lot should tried to keep the humor in check with the grim colors and darkness involved in mind.\n2)The visual effects, power-ups and battles that happen all across the board are so great and good and exciting that do actually eclipse everything that came before. That in itself may not have been all that surprising because time and sequels have a way of doing that, but let's not betterment as a granted for it is often known that might not be the case. \n3)Thanos. THANOS. THANAPTOSIS IS HIS WAY FOR NIHILISM IS EXISTENCE.\nOkay, caps-ing of the letters may have been a bit much but my praise of the supervillain isn't. He is everything Infinity War is all about and to him everything in MCEU has been leasing upto. He is power, pain, emotions and guilt, Idealism and Rationality pumped into one battle hardened super-bod that can and does tame in the stones of power, legend and cosmos just long enough to fulfill his promise and when that all is accomplished, he sits lonely in an unknown sense of pride etched on a guilt riddled face. It was all for him and despite how this franchise is, if he were not good as he turns out to be (Hats off to Brolin and the VFX teams) it could damaged the legacy of ten freaking years and nineteen whopping movies. And as he does promise, when he gets done, half of humanity does remain but whether it is perfect balance and mercy in addition remains to be seen as there is a certain call made by a certain person before a certain cosmic catastrophe happens which will lead to three more Marvel movies in-between and then, the most awaited Avengers movie of 2019. The fact that Brie Larson has been roped in Captain Marvel just makes it all the more better (The sheer volume of people involved and the awards and accolades in between all the cast members involved just speaks to the lengths of success this franchise boasts of). The rest of cast is bloody brilliant too in their own small ways. It makes so much worth your precious money that you will shout \"TAKE MY MONEY, already!\" when the next installment does roll around. Special mentions to Tom Holland (the dude is bit of a prodigy in almost anything he does), Elizabeth Olsen (She acts even better than how beautiful she is in moment of her existence), Zoe Saldana (She is frequent occurrence in fictional and emotional lore(s) like these and for good reason; I can finally say she was the best part of the GoTG group) and RDJ & Chris Hemsworth (The franchise oldies are golden in their portrayals and the shine they have; I will miss them if and when they do leave the franchise behind). All in all, that is my take on it. I had expected the half and half thing to happen in 2019 edition of this tale seeing as there was no clue as to where the Soul was, but now I and most people not privileged enough to be part of Feige's integral team are absolute bewilderment of what is to come. So good luck for the wait.", "This is the strongest movie in a cinematic universe full of great films. As the title says, it is simply incredible, a must see.", "When Kevin Feige brought in Russo brothers to direct Captain America: The Winter Soldier, no one anticipated them to be handling the holy grail of Marvelverse, the Infinity War. Synopsis: To balance the universe from desolation, Thanos aims to snuff away half of its lifeform, which he believes can be done if he yields all the six infinity stones viz., reality, time, power, space, soul & mind. However, his imposing plan gets stalled by earth's mightiest heroes 'The Avengers' & 'Guardians of Galaxy'. What MCU had been lacking for so long, was a perfect villain. Loki did impose his mischief charisma in his earlier outings like in 'The Avengers' or 'Thor' but it never was as intimidating & terrifying as Josh Brolin's exhibition of Thanos. He not only nailed the character but demonstrated what a perfect nemesis can be, which not just dictates audience but admiration. Of course, his minions, the members of Black Order were no less daunting, look out for the character Ebony Maw flawlessly depicted by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor. Kudos for putting in so many characters & yet making it perfectly balanced with coherent plot. Each member gets his & her share to shine. The action sequences were prodigious, something which we now are acquainted with & expect nothing short of spectacular from such franchise. Infinity War has ventured into an uncharted path, where very few movies will ever dare to do; stakes were high for Anthony & Joe Russo, as it could have gone either way as it did with last year's Justice League. It took a decade of meticulous planning of interlaced stories to finally unleash the wrath of mad titan. Did it pay off? Hell yeah, what did you expect! Infinity War is not just a movie but a cinematic phenomenon, ready to awe & shock the reactionary followers of MCU franchise & general audiences alike. Be ready to be blown away.", "Short and simple don't want give anything away it's by far the best marvel film recommend everyone go see it", "You will save more oxygen upon watching this film.\nBe sure not to forget breathing!", "Clearly it is the best movie i have ever seen. And please don't wait for the pirated version or see it in a cam version just go into a theater and watch this movie and believe me when i say this you will not be disappointed. Thanos is not like the other 'destroy universe and rule the world' type of a villain we have seen before (excluding Killmonger and Vulture) in the previous marvel movies. We will feel a connection to him and sometimes we may even feel that his motivation to wipe out half the the population of universe to save it not that bad.", "It was an amazing movie. Sometimes I was laughing or I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next . Can't wait for part 2. I recommend this movie to all marvel fans out there. Thanos is one of my favorite marvel villains ever Josh Borlin did a fantastic job playing a villain.", "The movie was a lot of fun and more than up to Marvel's high standards, but the plot line doesn't track. If the infinity stones are so powerful and so dangerous, and in the hands of Thanos can give him the power to wipe out half the universe, then why not just gather them up and take them to the mega-sized black hole at the center of our galaxy and launch them into the gravity well? Once they are sucked in past the event horizon, NOTHING, not even Thanos can get them back. And if there is any blow-back from the infinity stones as they are being destroyed, compared to the size and power of a giant black hole that sucks in star systems, planets, and other black holes for a daily snack, they would be nothing. Anything as dangerous as these stones, no one should be able to have.", "The best Marvel movie ever. But I still don't understand the last part of the movie because few people turns into dust and Thanos goes into some dream but the best marvel movie ever you will see..", "Just gonna bullet point my opinions:\n Overall I give it 9/10. Brilliant !", "Disney and marvel did an amazing job putting all feelings and emotions into one big movie, so many scenes of anticipation and sitting on the edge of your seat, action was phenomenaly done well, and leaves you on the one of the biggest cliffhangers ever.", "I would like to thank Kevin Feige, Russo Bro's, Screenplay writers and all the cast along with everyone involved in the movie. It's worth a long wait for the fans. Well, I had more and more expectations from the movie, but this movie exceeded my expectations. I watched it in IMAX and it's a worth movie watching in IMAX screen. Although the movie runs for 2 and half hours odd, but the screenplay is done so nicely that you'll feel the movie is fast. Thanks @Marvel Studios for giving us the awesome entertainment from the last 10 years and I'm sure you'll keep giving the same in future.", "Avengers: Infinity War is so good, you must see it in 3D. Every Avenger is here, from Spider-Man, to Iron Man, to Doctor Strange, to Black Panther, and others. I won't spoil anything, but this is a movie my theater was engaged in from start to finish. It surprisingly had a lot of funny parts in it, as my theater was laughing through much of the movie. My theater started booing and jeering when the credits started rolling (although many stayed through the credits in hopes of a post-credits scene). This movie is must-see.", "I had been waiting for this movie to come out for 10 years now, and it was definitely worth the wait. Avengers: Infinity War tells the story of the infamous Thanos and his sworn duty to balance the universe by wiping out half of its population. To do this he requires the 6 infinity stones that, when all together, form a weapon capable of doing so. The avengers, guardians of the galaxy and other hero's must join together to stop the mad titan before he can get all of the stones.  There are a lot of characters in this movie, so the directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, had a large task ahead of them as they had to balance each character in the story. They did a great job of that, and each character got an ample amount of screen time. The movie does imply that The audience has seen The movies leading up to this, and doesn't directly introduce all of the characters or who they are. The story was the best part of the movie, I won't get into details to avoid spoiling the plot, but it was simply amazing. There were a few holes that could have been fixed, omitted, or explained, but they weren't too bad. The movie is set in the aftermath of the events at the end of Captain America: Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok.  Throughout the film different planets are explored, each with a unique look. The visual effects of these planets, the characters, and the action were top notch. They definitely showed off this movie's $300 million budget. The movie flowed very well considering how much was actually happening all at once. There were a few times that it felt a bit clunky, but it didn't take away from its overall progression.  I had very high expectations for this movie going in, and I'm happy to say that they were exceeded. I typically try to be as critical as I can with these movies, and though it was not perfect, it still was, in my opinion, the best marvel movie to date, and one of my all time favorite movies.", "This was very shocking, The movie in terms of acting, directing, sound and visual effects is absolutely stunning, Marvel took the movie industry to a new era with this, I don't think that there is another movie that becomes close to the level of this epic movie. I really liked the new upgrades in the abilities of the superheros and sense of humor, but the qualities and abilities of Thanos are relay disturbing, however, its implied that all these characters are mortals, overall, so much entertaining and thrilling experience. I would have given this 10/10, But for the fast pace of events and the catastrophic ending, I gave it 9/10. For those who give this movie 1 and 2 rates, come on, its obvious that you want to pull it down, this movie cannot be rated lower than 6/10 by any means, its simply non sense !!", "There is no single reason why thos movie doesn't deserve 10 stars.\nIt is a perfect balance between the characters. The story, action, fun and drama is all awesome!", "The plot, the characters, the cinematography, the action sequences, the drama, the humors: all in over this movie gives a package of feelings to any superhero movie fan. now, being a Marvel's fan, it has given me goosebumps. \nThere are many things about this movie worthy of discussing. Among them, 5 awesomeness having heart-warming effects are: \n1.Entry Scene Of Captain America\n2.The characters of Iron Man & Doctor Strange (played by two of my favourite actors)\n3.The war scene at Wakanda\n4.The emotional Scene between Spider Man and Iron man (where Peter said to Stark, \"I'm ready yet to go\")\n5.Little surprise of Peter Dinklage\nNow for the critics, please do watch all the previous Avengers movie atleast and then decide how to react and write a proper review. Because one thing I can tell for sure your \"negative attitude\" can't prevent people from watching this movie.", "Brilliantly done..\nGood tone to the film from the begging to the end..", "It's agreat movie from marvel with unexpected end and the graphics was very good , but there is alot of comedy in some scenes require darkness", "A movie that will forever be remembered as the greatest super hero movie yet to be made", "Beautifull storytelling,great pace,great vilain which you can sympathize and understand,everything on this movie is near perfect,interactions with out loved heroes are perfectly done,the comedy in this movie is HILARIOUS,naturaly done and not forced.This is the darkest and most brutal Marvel film to date. A RECOMMENDED for Marvel comic book fans,non comic book fans and fans of great superhero films like the Dark knight.", "It's by far one of the best movies I've seen. And the best done by Marvel Studios. Authencity and respect to the original comic books are evident and gives the movie more power. The 10-year celebration for the release of the first Marvel movie certainly was filled with fireworks and an ensemble cast that you will never witness in the history of any superhero movie starting with the powerful Titan and human Thanos portrayed by a captivating performance from Josh Brolin.", "Avengers Infinity War is an incredible cinematic event from start to finish. The film takes no time to delay getting in to the action with major narrative and plot arks that sees characters develop from the last time we saw them. A great continuation movie from both civil war and Thor Ragnorok. Even the near silent opening titles with the Asguardian Distress signal gave me shivers. The films ending was incredible, it was so unpredictable and clever. Seeing such crucial characters turn to dust was heartbreaking. Peter Parker's was especially hard hitting as it affected Tony so much. Overall This is an insanely great superhero movie that will change the MCU forever.", "Defying the odds by delivering continued, even enhanced, brilliance as the franchise moves on. The best by far... so far...", "First of the expectations for this movie were one of the highest ever, some would say a bit unrealistic and a tad overhyped with all the trailers and promotions, Now after watching it I can honestly say that all my expectations were met, I probably got even more than I asked for, The characters were perfectly implemented with none of them feeling left out, everyone had their moment or two as they were in my opinion perfectly juggled trough out the whole movie, The acting was on point, the action was everywhere from minute one with only slight pauses that would let you catch your breath along with the perfect amount of humor before all hell breaks loose again. Now I don't think the movie was absolutely perfect, there are a few mistakes that I would like to point out, first one would be Ebony Maw freezing in space instantly after getting ejected into it, as we know it would take hours for a person to freeze in space because the only way to lose heat up there is to radiate it away witch takes hours, the second thing i didn't like was about Thanos, even though he was really consistent trough the whole movie it would often be pointed out that if you give him what he wants he will spare at least half the lives he comes across, with the exception of the dwarves, he only left one dwarf alive while telling him rather mean things to make him feel even worse, I think that was a mistake and it made him feel slightly inconsistent. But to be honest those things are hard to notice during the movie and it still earns a 10/10 for the experience and the amount of fun I had watching this movie.", "This movie just did so well with the action and drama great movie enjoyed a lot watching also i think the ending was just a bit to far but sill it was amazing  best marvel movie ever", "This movie had me on the edge of my seat, barely eating my movie snacks and had me screaming along with other movie goers when my favourite characters met their demise. It had a touch of humour, incredibly heartfelt scenes between characters who deserved them and even a bit of a twist from the purple grape himself.  This movie definitely lived up to the hype and I will definitely be going back to the theatre to see it another one or two times", "Great movie by fans of the MCU, for fans of the MCU. It really delivers. Action packed from start to end and lots of fun combination of individuals.", "'Avengers: Infinity War' is a film 10 years in the making. Marvel Studios has been building to this since the first 'Iron Man' back in 2008, and it is more than worth the wait. Infinity War has everything you could want in a film of this scale: mind-blowing action, gut-busting humor, extremely satisfying character interactions, a terrifying villain you can kind of sympathize with, and a few truly heartbreaking moments. The film's directors, the Russo brothers, manage to fit all of this into a nearly 3 hour movie and still have it flow perfectly from one scene to the next. The pacing is fantastic for the amount of major characters in one movie. It never felt slow or boring and kept my eyes glued to the screen. The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie. It was like watching a comic book come to life. Seeing the different heroes fight alongside each other was incredible, and every character has a moment to shine. Infinity War marked the first crossover between the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy, and their various interactions were everything I ever wanted them to be. The humor was hilarious, yet never felt out-of-place. The scenes that needed to be serious were exactly as they should have been. The film's villain, Thanos (portrayed brilliantly by Josh Brolin), is without a doubt the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best and most interesting antagonist to date. He commanded the screen and stole every scene he was in. He is also by far the most real looking CGI character I have ever seen. Unfortunately, he is responsible for pretty much all of the heartbreaking moments I mentioned earlier. If you think this is just another happy, bright Marvel movie, you are sorely mistaken. This is a war, and not everyone makes it out alive. My advice? Bring tissues. Lots and lots of tissues. As for standout performances, there are a few. Josh Brolin (Thanos), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), and Zoe Saldana (Gamora) all had major roles in the film and their acting was on point. In conclusion, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not only the best Marvel movie to date, it is the greatest comic book movie of all time.", "Avengers Infinity war is a epic movie from The Marve Studios . The Story is interesting but Not so logic and Thanos is Finally The Villain Marvel Ever had. In The Movie you can find Lots of GCI and The GCI is very good. The Fights are worth seeing. The End of The Movie shocked Fans is but meaningless.", "As of this writing over 800 reviews have already been submitted so I'm going to try and not rehash what anyone else may have said.  First, they killed off Loki and Heimdall in the first few minutes of the film. From what I've already seen and read their characters will not be returning to the MCU. I'm not too happy about that but that's showbiz folks.  The film was an exciting, thrilling, edge of your seat, in your face roller coaster ride cinematic feast. The CGI was exceptional except for Thanos. He still looked like something out of CGI's earlier days before it was perfected. How they could get that so wrong and unrealistic I have no idea. I've seen games on my grandsons' PS4 that look more realistic than Thanos did.  This particular Avengers' story was fought on three battle fronts so all the characters were never in one place where they could meet one another and hang out. No down time in this movie. Obviously, I expected too much. Mr. Purple (Thanos) seemed to get more screen time than did our real life heroes. The ending though was unbelievably shocking that I never saw coming because I don't read comics and never did growing up. So, yeah, I'm a little out of the loop but I can still love and appreciate the films. I'm sure someone has already spilled the beans but I won't. I'll just say hold back the tears and grit your teeth because you won't see it coming. I walked out of the theater repeating to myself, \"are you kidding me, I can't believe this\" over and over to myself. Now I've got to wait till 2019 to find out what happens. Well, I hope I'm still here being an older fan.  Of course, all of the carnage and the impending fate of our super heroes probably wouldn't have happened if Thor had just cut off the arm that Thanos had the gauntlet on, or chopped off his purple head. But Marvel Studios wants some more of our hard-earned money fans so we have to wait for part two, which is why I only gave a rating of 8. This is a great Avengers film, the best yet, but it has a very disappointing heart-wrenching cliffhanger. Instead of closure and the defeat of Thanos Marvel gives its fans shock and awe with a bittersweet twist to be continued.  Oh, and yes there were a lot of funny moments, though not nearly enough as Thor Ragnarok.", "* THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS * Wow! This movie is amazing. I'm in no way a die hard Marvel fan but I have watched most of the MCU movies and I can safely say that the hype is both warranted and lived up to. Thanos is by far the greatest villain we have seen and of course he should be. The most incredible thing about Thanos was how quickly and strongly I felt emotionally attached to him. The moment when you sacrificed Gamora, I could tell he was genuinely crying and upset. The way he interacts with her as a child shows how much he actually cares for her. Thanos is one of the few villains who I've found myself connecting with. Whilst his goal to wipe out half the universe is in no way a good thing, his motivation for doing it (a cull in order to preserve the finite resources of the universe) is completely believable and makes sense considering the experience he had on his home planet.\nWhen Thanos won at the end of the movie, I couldn't help but feel a bit of happiness for him. As he stood in the sunset and spoke to Young Gamora, I was pleased that he had completed his goal after all of his personal losses. The ending of this movie shocked me. I was expecting the usual \"they all lived happily ever after\" storyline but the fact that it wasn't like that made this film infinitely better. The fight scenes are choreographed to perfection and the special effects are stunning.\nI would go as far to say this is one of the best films I have ever seen and I think it deserves to break all of the box office records.", "Wow! What a ride from start to finish, had me on the edge of my seat. I laughed and i cried, once it was finished i wanted more. Best Avengers movie so far. Loved seeing all my favourites in the same movie. Cant wait for more.", "The beginning of the end has started with this one. No spoilers here because this is a must see for yourself. Since the first Avengers, everyone has wanted to see Thanos face the Avengers and boy does he. Everything about this movie is what people love about the MCU. The directors did a great job mixing the comedy, action, and drama together and pushing the story the whole time. This is a movie you'll want to see again right after it is over, at least for me it is!", "A cinematic crossover event unprecedented in its action, humor and melodrama, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an ambitious addition to the MCU in the same way \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) or \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1\" (2010) were for their own series.\nThe film somehow manages to coherently smash together a multitude of heroes and produce compelling, non-stop entertainment with high emotional stakes. There are minor frustrations with some characters needing more screen time, but \"Avengers: Infinity War\" accomplishes its goals as the first entry in an epic two-part installment. 9/10 or A-", "In my opinion this is an awesome movie, but how would it be if you hade only seen The Iron Man trilogy... My lovely girl has only seen some of the movies but she falls asleep way to fast. But she did absolutely love this movie !", "Making things clear this is a no spoler review.. Really don't wanna spoil the movie coz it is definately a movie to be experienced... In 3D or in IMAX if thats available... The movie is a visual treat... After being pushed to end credit scenes and Cameos the Mad Titan comes in the limelight.... And boy he does not dissapoint.. He is the meanest creature in the Universe.. Hell bent on wiping half the population of the universe he embarks on the mission to collect all 6 infinity stones.. Josh Brolin as the Mad Titan Thanos nails it and even though he is CGI bt the motion capture nails it and bring out the emotions perfectly.. If I start writing individually about all the characters then this review will go for pages and pages coz there are a lot nd by lot i mean hell lotta characters... So to cut it short.. Everyone played their part nicely and got decent screen time.. The Russo Brothers (Joe and Anthony) deserve special mention because handling so many characters is not easy and other people might have failed miserably. But the Russos nail it. Giving each character ample screen time and push the storyline and character arc of every character forward.. It was the penultimate episode of 10 years of the MCU. And trust me this is not your run of the mill Marvel movie. This movie will evoke emotions in you which you never thought existed... Its a roller-coaster ride and it is worth taking... So go to a theater near you and catch this brilliant piece of movie which will stay with you evern after you leave the theatre... Rating : 4.8 / 5 #AvengersInfinityWar #Avengers #RussoBrothers #Thanos", "This is the first review I've ever written, and I think this is the perfect movie to take that spot. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time and my favorite MCU film to date. I'm a particularly big fan of how they took the character arc of Thor, I thought it was very well done. The humor felt natural to the characters, and not shoehorned in as I felt some of the jokes were in Ragnarok (also an enjoyable film, though). There were some moments of humor that didn't quite land with me, but that's okay. I also very much liked how the handled Thanos and the movie, to me, is more of a Thanos film than an Avengers film. Josh Brolin does an excellent job. There is one particularly emotional scene and I almost began to sympathize with him. Those who have seen the film will know what I'm referring to. There are many surprises and things you won't see coming. I went in only having seen one or two of the trailers, and I'm glad I did. See it as soon as you can and avoid spoilers as much as possible. It is, to me, a truly excellent film. 10/10 would recommend and 10/10 would watch again.", "An epic space/action spectacle that delivers serious action and emotion.", "I've been going to marvel movies since the first Spider-Man movie hit back in the early 2000s. I've seen so much change and disappointment throughout the years. Over the past 10 years however I have been a die hard fan of the majority of the marvel movies that have come out. \nWith that being said this is absolutely 100% my favorite. You've probably read articles and reviews that have described how the audience was unable to control their reactions to certain scenes in this movie. From my experience that holds true. \nYou've probably also read that the movie is so overwhelming that many people are going to have to see it more than once. That also is true. \nWhat completely blew my mind about this movie is the way it was able to throw the fanbase off in speculation only to show them that they were wrong almost completely \nEvery character (aside from 1-2) that dies was predicted to live. While all the characters that people were sure were doomed Were the last ones standing. \nThis along with one mindblowingly shocking of a former villain that wasn't advertised at all were the best parts of the movie. \nI liked this movie too much to give it anything less than a 10 but 2 things I didn't like were the cliffhanger and the post credit scene. At least we know that there's sequels for a lot of the characters that died and on top of that at least there's only a year gap between this one and the second part.", "Again Marvel has done it again. There's no denying it, it's a must watch. Better and bigger than the first two Avengers. Can't wait for the 4th installment.", "ACTION , HUMOR , PASSION ,SUSPENSE a total package !", "The whole movie itself was great everyone had there own story two them and it felt like you knew them. Then when something happened to them it felt like you felt it yourself. But the ending left you wanting more and it was great In all. SPOILER WARNING: when Gamora died you felt Thanos pain and when he got all the infinity stones you felt there fear. When Spider Man died I felt for him and I admit it I cried", "The Russo Brothers have created something that could have messed up really bad. But it doesn't and is complete perfection. Lets me first start off by saying the wait for Thanos was definitely worth it. Josh Brolin puts in a spectacular performance into Thanos and really does scare you and most importantly you buy his motives, I would even go as far as saying that Thanos is maybe the best MCU villain to date. Another thing that I would applaud the Russo Brothers for is definitely not pulling any punches, when action is needed it is great, even better than their last superhero movies. And when their is emotion needed you definitely feel it. But one of my favorite things in this movies is the Universal stakes really hit home on a visceral level were this may not be the case on many of the past comic book movies. Lastly, this is not a stand alone movie, this is a movie one decade int he making and you definitely feel that fro the opening credits to the end credits. I would strongly recommend anyone who has invested time into this series to watch this movies or maybe even your casual moviegoer.", "I feel like some reviewers here aren't comic book fans. Infinity War/Infinity Gauntlet are exactly cheerful, positive stories. Everyone was mad Ragnorak was too silly and now Infinity War was too bleak? It's like there's no win/win with the fans. I liked this movie. It had more of a comic book feel. Is it Marvels best? No. Is it on par with Winter Soldier? No. I don't think we will get one of those again. The Pros:\n1) Benedict Cumberbatch is so good at Dr. Strange it's scary. He really has a handle on the role and literally stole every scene he was in. Really enjoy watching him.\n2) Chris Hemsworth was also really good. He always gives his all with Thor (despite the stinker Dark World) and it's appreciated.\n3) The back story/origin on Gamora was nice. It gave Thanos the \"meat\" he needed to make him a better villain than most of Marvels bad guys. \n4) I love Tom Holland. I really love, love him as Spider-Man. He was a great choice.\n5) The movie had surprises and that was a nice change. Even heroes in comic books die/can't defeat the villain every time. This was SO much better than Ultron and his lackluster defeat.\n6) The pacing was good. It moved fast and quickly into action. The Cons:\n1) Stop killing Groot. Please?\n2) Chris Evans is really phoning it in at this point. He didn't seem like he cared to be there; just living out a contract obligation. That makes me sad. Still think they should have let Falcon rake over as Captain America for awhile (shot Chris in Civil War/put him on ice),\n3) A lot of exposition with the CGI. At times the fight scenes were...messy and overly done with CGI and green screen.\n4) A few cash cow moments like overdoing the Wakanda stuff, milking the success of Black Panther. \n5) Some characters are \"just there\" not doing much to advance the story.\n6) At times more action than story. I think it's good and worth watching. A very ambitious attempt on the part of Marvel and the writers.  I still think the original Avengers and Winter Soldier were Marvels peak. Not sure if they will ever come close to that again with stories and direction.  8/10", "This movie was really a good one. It had almost everything emotion, fun and some or I will say many unexpected things related to the death of superhero's or stones location. This movie deserves 9/10 and it is a movie which you will feel to watch 2-3 more times.", "Emotions run high throughout. Marvel has made it possible for me to feel sympathy for Thanos during this film, however it has been made clear the importance of every actor, but in my personal opinion how important Spider-Man (Tom Holland) whose acting was beyond phenomenal, I was almost brought to tears because of the superb quality of acting that he (Tom) provided. Overall this movie ends on a note of pure anticipation for next year! If you can't handle anticipation well, I recommend viewing this movie later. Although in my opinion it was well worth the wait.", "It was a great movie and it would be a little though job to bring this movie into life. The first thing I want to say they made a great job by putting the biggest suspence that all newbie avengers die at the end and the suspense is how they will come back. As we can't miss the spiderman. They need to bring back the lost avengers soon. And they have not bought captain marvel in the first part and I salute to them for showing the patience of not bringing an end to the thanos. They really worked hard for this film as we all know in avengers 4 we can see all died avengers living again. I was surprised to see avengers loosing and even confused what did doctor strange see in the future.", "Thanos has arrived after Ten Years of waiting!\nNo matter if you hate Marvel Movies or not, this is the movie you've been waiting for the last ten years.\nThis is the 10th year anniversary of the MCU and the end of an era for Marvel Films. Of course there will be more movies, but there will be different in a better way.\nI have to say that this Movie is only for Marvel fans, if your not one and haven't watched the last couples of Films, then you'll probably don't know what is happening. For enjoy this the most you need to watch at least Thor Ragnarok, Civil War and the previous Avengers. I don't consider myself a hardcore Marvel fan, although I enjoy most of the Movies (excluding of course Thor 1,2, Captain America 1 and Iron Man 2, I truly hate those Movies) and get excited with every Stan Lee cameo. I think that this is another fun Marvel Movie that every MCU fan will enjoy, laugh and cry. The thing is that I don't thing this deserve a 9.1 or even a 8. \nTHIS IS NOT THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE! Overall a great film with great characters (although some not so much) an amazing villain and big surprises.\nThis is indeed the film of the summer we've all waiting for!", "While this is a great film...I feel the unnecessary deaths to some popular characters are too predictable for the next part of the movie. Especially when some lackluster heroes are still alive...I love the way the directors are giving the audience how strong Thor really is and the number of things his powers can do. I love how Tony's tech evolves in every new movie...but the movie could have used some shared screen time with all of the original avengers together and since heimdall died, where was Valkyrie and Skurge? They were on the spaceship with Thor at the end of Ragnarok also.", "It's fun to see many characters together that are favorites. Some are downright surprising to see together. However, there is not enough time to develop a specific storyline for your favorites. I found the ending weird and did not understand how the script writers came to that conclusion very well. That could've been developed better (and lessen some of the action scenes to do so). Still, a worthy movie to see.", "Highly recommmend watching this film. Lot of fun seeing it with a group of friends. After seeing it at the cinema, it leaves you completely shocked, with plenty of great comedic and dramatic moments scattered throughout. Definitely one of the greatest Marvel films to date.", "I really have to commend the Russo Brothers and Marvel Studios for this film. I can't imagine what a task it must have been to balance all these many characters and still make a good and entertaining film. That said, it's not perfect.\nIt's a bit too long, and a a little bloated. It particularly gets a little dull in the middle. However these flaws were always going to be unavoidable for a film like this, with so many characters and tones having to mesh. That's why I say that, while the film's not perfect, it's the best it could have been. \nThe film is quite funny, and all the jokes land. The action is great. Seeing the characters meet and interact is very fun. \nThe highlight of the film, for sure, is the villain. Thanos is fantastic. He has a clear motivation, and real menace.\nVery fun film for everyone. It is definitely a part 1 though, so keep that in mind. 8/10", "What do you get when you bring together over 20 of the most talented actors of all time to team up in an effort to save the planet from extinction? Infinity War.... I was blown away by the emotion I felt throughout this movie and I just didn't want it to end. I'm a huge fan of the MCU and before seeing Infinity Wars I watched all of the other Marvel movies in sequence to prepare myself for this masterpiece... let's just say that I was not disappointed by any means. Josh Brolin did an awesome job playing Thanos. I will most likely see this film 3 or 4 more times in theaters before owning it on DVD and Digital. Don't even pay attention to Anyone who rated this movie low (1 thru 5), these people don't have an understanding or the MCU and therefore cannot fully grasp all that this movie masterpiece really offered.", "Biggest Wednesday in asia, not disappointed for wait long times ago.", "As a Marvel comics and movies fan, I found this film to be quite enjoyable and what I want to see in a MCU film. It has that feel of taking your Marvel action figures out of the toy box and creating your own story. It has the feel of a hash up of multiple characters tossed together fighting against pure evil which works well for this type of film. It has the feel of exactly what I would expect a super hero film to be, and what I would want it to be. With this in mind, I want to examine four aspects I enjoyed and some which I didn't. There are many aspects to like about this film, in my opinion, from the separate stories to the humor to the emotional roller coaster to the development of its main antagonist, this film hits on many marks. To start, I enjoyed the portrayal of different groups pursuing their missions because I really think the multiple stories emboldens what you would find occurring in actual comic story lines. Bringing the MCU a realistic comic book feel. Each group is on a path to prevent/protect something, and given the multitude of characters in the film, this is the best way to handle them - by giving them all individual goals to achieve. These goals is what sets up the plot, while admittedly a simple plot (This is a super hero movie after all), their is still a purpose, a pursuit, and a journey that our heroes travel on which keeps the movie progressing forward. This also works for the movie because it mix and matches different heroes in uniquely pleasant ways, providing the opportunity for humor. This brings me to the second and third aspects I enjoyed about this film. The humor, for me, landed well and increased my enjoyment of the film. Humor is a everyday part of our lives, even when we are faced with challenging situations. This movie does well to keep this aspect of humanity alive in a world where threat of danger isn't only probable, its a reality. Keeping up a lighter air at moments provides a roller coaster ride of sorts,producing a variety of emotions throughout the film. We, the viewer, is taken through this emotional journey just like how the characters themselves experience. This leaves me with strong feelings about events that occur in the film, and any film that can do that gets a high grade from me. Lastly, the development of the main antagonist was one of the greatest aspects of this film. They took a villain and gave him a down to earth persona. They gave him viable and believable motivations. They gave him emotions. All of this results in the need for him to make sacrifices in the pursuit of his purpose. While his intentions may be rooted in good intentions, they still amount to an evil plan that will result in a colossal amount of lost lives. This makes for a completely evil and menacing villain, which is necessarily for a film that has been ten years in the making. Keeping in mind that this is first and foremost a super hero action flick meant solely to entertain, there are still some negative aspects/issues I have concerning this film. What comes to mind first is how some heroes were weaken while others were strengthen. I admit I can get past this, but Marvel should know how to avoid this inconsistency. On the same note, some characters from previous MCU films were no where to be seen. Some characters were left in the same place we returned to in this film. No explanation given, what? Let me remark real quick on the ending since many others have complained about this for one reason or another. All I'm going to say is that we, as viewers and fans, may know what will end up happening in the next movie. I for one will enjoy the ride on how we get there. Just because an assumption may draw us to a particular conclusion, doesn't mean the journey to get there won't be a wealth of entertainment. While I touched on the four main aspects I enjoyed, my enjoyment is not limited to multiple stories, humor, emotional roller coaster, and the antagonist. The directors also did a great job of capturing the tone of each character / film series keeping the spirit of all the MCU franchises continuous. The effects, as usual for an MCU movie, were terrific without overshadowing the performances of its cast. The action scenes were thrilling and inviting, boosting up my adrenaline level and continuing the emotional roller coaster I mentioned. A roller coaster caused from humor, destruction, evil, and the hope for our heroes' success. The film does have lapses in some elements, but that doesn't in any way diminish the enjoyment of this film. Despite the negatives, the film is an overall enjoyable, fun ride through an imaginary world of super heroes.", "Please watch. At least twice. Everyone get their reason and motivation explained. Every plot is meaningful. Everyone in the theater was shocked and moved.\nI know it's weird but I kind of respect Thanos after watching for the second time.", "Two amazing Marvel super hero movies with a couple moths of each other. But which is better ? thankfully you dont have to chose. What can you say about this without spoiling the movie ? Its 2 hrs 40 minutes long, but every minute of it is engrossing. So much action, but done in such a manner that you dont get bored with it. DC have a long way to go to get to this level.", "The movie had a good balance between comedy and plot, and the plot was very good. Without giving anything away, the movie is marvel through and through, and yet so much more! Definitely worth the watch", "The last movie I saw in theaters, was The Last Jedi, which made me think Disney is going to ruin everything I love. Thankfully, Avengers was amazing and I recommend everyone to go see it. The story is so incredible! I had some ideas about how the story was going to play out, but it was so much better then I could have imagined. It starts off strong and keeps the momentum going til the very end. In between these beautiful scenes, are wonderfully emotional moments, with the characters we have all grown to love. The most delightful surprise, were the funny moments, very similar to the humor in Thor Ragnarok. Easily my favorite marvel movie so far, but the next Avengers movie will probably be even better!", "Alright, I'll put it straight, this is dope, the movie that I expect! Totally breaks the role of hero's journey. Actions are endless and shifting. Intense through the whole 2 and a half hours. Heartbreaking by such a tragedy in terms of some deaths are even unpredictable. The cliffhanger in the end really proves everything just gets started, and brings us curiosity and confusion. Love the way it focuses on Thanos's story line and how he kicks main characters' asses. It is still funny though, tons of hilarious dialogue and chilling among those characters still make me laugh a lot. Not gonna lie, however, this superhero movie really makes me feel the end of the world. Gun's a'blazin! Can't wait to see the next Avengers movie next year! Good job Marvel, and happy 10th birthday!", "Infinity war was all the hype and then some. Must see if you're a comic book fan and mcu fan.", "I still preferred The Dark Knight better than this movie but this is the second greatest comic book movie ever. It had everything I wanted and then some more. I love that during this movie I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Every single shot was not wasted and everything moved the plot along. The main character was Thanos and we actually had a villain with character instead of a big bad brute who just wanted to kill for the hell of it, there was purpose behind it, at least in his mind. There were many moments where I was laughing, then 2 minutes later I was sad. So many highs and lows throughout the movie. The acting was great all around besides Bruce Banner. The ending was so great because no body expected it and it just leaves us wanting more from these movies. I cannot WAIT to see what they're going to do next year. Absolutely phenomenal.", "Avengers: Infinity War is an unrelenting thrill ride of action-packed spectacle. Thanos is easily the best antagonist of the MCU, with genuine moral depth and intimidation (Ebony Maw is also a stand-out). Many characters shine brightly in this film, while others are wasted or used poorly (at least in the theatrical cut). The screenplay has a few problems with exposition, logic and a few tonal shifts. Alan Silvestri's score is incredible, the 2.5 hour running time felt shockingly quick to my pleasant surprise, and the ending is powerfully impactful. Avengers: Infinity War is nevertheless an overwhelming and ambitious blockbuster extravaganza that is the beginning of an even greater culmination for the MCU.", "All types of twists in this movie. \nAnd stay for the after credits awesome.", "I knew going in that it was only part 1 of a 2 part story so when it ended I was ok with that but I did find it to be a very amazing movie. Hoping those who vanished are not gone forever and that Gamora is not dead she is my favourite alien.", "Thanos as a character was the showstopper for me throughout the entire movie. I have never had any interest in such supervillains featured before in movies and cartoons because they seemed to be too powerful and without any flaws. Also, on the represention side, they looked too CGI-ey to the point that they were merely characters from an overly done cutscene in a generic video game. However, Thanos became very appealing to me throughout the progression of the story in Avengers 3 and I became heavily invested in his character arc. He is definitely among the most fleshed out in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, almost to the point where I was rooting for his cause, having a strong emotional connect with him, rather than siding with the good guys. This was a very non classical comic book villain with a lot of moral relativism . The CGI was very good in depicting Thanos' grandeur. It actually felt like a 10 ft tall guy, who was very imposing and charming, having his way onscreen. Not any of the uncanny valley silliness going on. The motion capture of the actor Josh Brolin's facial expressions blended seamlessly with the digital build of Thanos. Also, Josh Brolin did a fantastic job on his own bringing this titan to life. There were some plot points where the character of Thanos did in retrospect sort of act like a fool but Josh's acting easily helped evade that observation while watching the movie. My only big gripe with the movie was when it kept going back to the plight of Scarlet Witch and Vision as a couple. Their chemistry was very bland , boring and cliched and the scenes that featured them were the only instances the film moved very slowly to me. Almost to the point I kept looking at the time on my phone waiting for it to pass.I was least interested in those characters.I just wish they were written such that they both took a cyanide pill and saved the audience the trouble of keeping up with their Twilight romance nonsense. Also, there is a certain cameo in this film by a certain someone and I like how the physical build of the character that the person portrayed was a direct subversion of the actor's actual physical stats.  Overall, a damn good enjoyable popcorn movie having a solid A+ villain.", "This movie somehow has the ability to keep you entertained for nearly three hours, but it has its problems. As good as the story and villain are you can't ignore the elephant in the room, you need to see nearly every marvel movie to understand what is going on. Thankfully if you have seen enough marvel movies to understand the plot you will be treated with a fantastic and dark story with a great villain! Just if you haven't seen a marvel movie and want to watch this, don't. You won't enjoy yourself. If you have this will be to you one of the best movies of the year up to this point", "Besides the first GOTG movie, this really is the best Marvel has had to offer. They finally found the perfect mix of action, humor and everything else that they had pieced together through all their other films. Worth every penny and probably worth a second watch.", "All must watch this movie. Contain perfect meeting of power between the best marvel's word heroes", "Having dodged spoilers for the past few days, I finally saw Avengers: Infinity War today. Let me tell you, it BLEW ME AWAY! I've been a Marvel fanboy since I was a kid and this is one of those movies you see and then just play moments over and over again in your head. You may think with all those stars and heros in there that things can get a little messy and confusing and the Russo brothers sorted it all out perfectly. I'd say the real star would have to be Brolin as Thanos. The presence commanded by him in every scene he's in is amazing! The way you see this shadowy character unfold over 2 1/2+ hours is something I had yet to see in another Marvel film. There are surprises you don't see coming, the trailers did a great job at not giving anything away so be prepared to scoop your jaw off the floor when it ends. Definitely leading up to part 2 as there's A LOT left hanging when everything wraps up and that post credit scene rolls.", "On a purely subjective level, I loved this movie. Ever fiber in my nerdy body fell in love with this movie. I wont get into much more but I had a blast watching this unfold. As I said however, this is not a movie, this is an event. Do not walk into this movie expecting rich character moments or complex themes. You really have to have seen the prior films to understand who everyone is and what they're all about. It's 3 hours of people punching things. I have a few other complaints but then I'd be getting into spoiler territory.", "I loved it and after Watching it I wanted to see it again. However after reading some of the reviews on IMDb it didn't felt like I watched the same movie as everybody else! Some people said it had plot holes, characters where out their character and complained about the ending... For starters the people who gave this movie a low rating could not have possibly seen all marvel movies that comes before infinity war. Yeah you get plot holes if you miss a movie or two or all! You can't just watch the avengers movies to get this one, it ain't possible!  And characters has changed. From the latest avengers movie because there are a lot of other movies between this one! character change but it's not like we haven't seen the development... If you come and see the movie you know this one is in two parts... if you didn't know that then where have you been? You can't complain about something we all knew before seeing the movie. Of course there is a cliffhanger and we want to know what happens but that's the point... you can't fit so much in a movie  Overall if you haven't watched all the marvel movies before watching this one don't watch it! You ruins it for everyone else. I've watched all the other movies and I loved this one. It has action, emotion, humour and suspense! This was a hit!!", "This is honestly the best film to be ever released. So much action, drama and just have no words for this remarkable piece of art!!", "Absolutely amazing film. Ever since I was a kid I would imagine what seeing a comic book brought to life would look like, well this is it. Thor and the Guardians Steal the show, but everyone really contributes to the success of this comic book masterpiece", "Marvel definitely came through with this one. This movie had me captured from the very beginning and it didn't fail to let go.\nThere were different stories that all came together in such a harmonious way. So good yet sad.\nI stayed til all the credits were over, but I don't know what that star symbol was that Samuel Jackson was calling.\n10 Stars across the board!", "Normally when I get excited for a movie, I expect too much and am not satisfied with the movie. This movie excelled my expectations and I couldn't have been more happy. I was left speechless, while also filled with many different emotions. If you want the best experience do not look at any spoilers.", "I have never seen a movie that has captured my attention from start to finish like this one. I was laughing and absolutely devastated.", "This is not just a movie. It is an intricate symbiosis of strong emotions which were lost somewhere in time till now. It is no doubt by far the most heart quenching, questioning piece of superhero franchise movie who has made me go to a state of no-judgmental state of a fan. This movie is not about wow factor or box office or fan club. It is realisation.", "The movie is amazing from start to finish..the only thing I would like to have seen more of is longer fight scene when Thor arrives on the battlefield. Wish it showed a longer amount fight scene and not gone to somewhere else..Was my only complaint but other than that..Best Avengers movie and super hero movie of all time period.", "It was the best movie in MArvel cinematic universe so far !", "Must see film bring the tissue this was amazing can't wait till the next", "Avengers: Infinity War comes after a long line of previous Marvel films, and some would say that the same old formula is getting pretty exhausting. Infinity War definitely has a lot of the same formula, and still plays it safe at times, but it is definitely a step up from a lot of the previous films. Doesn't say as much as Black Panther, but still has some philosophical moments. This film also has a villain a tad more interesting than most of the bland MCU films in previous entries, and we get to understand a bit more of how he thinks. He is a bit more complex than most of the previous villains, and that is refreshing. Avengers: Infinity War was a pretty good film, not amazing, but a decent enough Marvel film in a time when its formula has been getting pretty tiring.", "An amazing movie ,stunning .i felt that i watched 4 superhero high class movies at once...\nI'd rate it 9.5 only for 2 scenes...the scene thor activating the star was boring and unjustified...\nAnd the last seen of cap mourning vision had a very bad cgi specially with hulkbuster", "To say I was excited about this film was an understatment, and I was not left underwhelmed. This film gave me everything from hysterical laughter to tears of sadness. I worried with so many characters that it would be lost, but every character was given the best scene for them to shine. Action, action, action followed by the biggest emotional punch to the gut ever! I've never loved a film and hated it so much in my life! Love this film!!!", "Just watched this movie and i must say what an epic movie this is from the start.Josh Brolin's Potrayal Of Thanos is not just Great but Legendary,He is fearless,evil,destroyer of worlds,but has a heart for Gamora, He loves her very much,his emotion expressions are just great he is by far the most epic and strongest villain the Avengers", "You can't fault this film at all 10 out of 10 really does make up for ultron non stop action from beginning till end. There isn't many films where you get a great ending but this is by far one of the best it keeps you really eager for part 2 I wish I could spill out everything but I hate spoilers so go and watch and enjoy", "I've used IMDB since I knew what the internet was and I have never wrote a review until now. This movie is THE movie we've (everyone who has been watching all the marvel movies) been waiting for. It's got action, comedy (They know when to do it), good story, good cgi, good heartfelt moments, good actors and best of all, a perfect villain. All the reviews with low scores are pure nonsense, 'Too many actions, too many superheroes, boring' Boring!? That's when I knew they written it just out of spite because probably everyone around them loved it and so they came here to hurt the score. One review I could relate, it has so many superheroes that they weren't given a lot of time to actually shine on the movie. But what I really loved about this movie it's that is a Thanos movie, it's his story, the big bad buy who was pulling the strings from the shadows has finally emerge to the MCU and we get to see his life, his goals and how far he is willing to go for it. And that is why I could probably see some people dislike it but for me it was a good surprise. And the ending, if you seen every MCU movie then you would CERTAINLY NOT expect it. I always view the MCU movies playing it safe, I expected them to change their tactics on CA: Civil War but it was the same but on this one, well they actually went ahead and did it. Keep in mind that this is a Part 1 and most likely they did it this way because of it. Now you know the villain, you know what he is capable of and what he did and that is the perfect plot for Part 2, making our superheroes whom we have come to know and love to unify one last time and shine together as the Avengers against a great made villain who actually lives up to his name, Mad Titan Thanos. Overrall, you either love or hate the MCU movies. If you have never liked them, this won't interest you but if you have seen it since Iron Man 1 and have been waiting for Thanos since Avengers 1 then I promise you, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED", "Avengers Infinity War brings you a fantastic mix of all the concepts you'd like to see in a superhero movie: an epic villain, amazingly coreographed fight scenes, death, balanced humor and sadness. I also want to say that VFX in this movie were the best i'd seen in a while. I love seeing the effort the team has put on the movie and with IW i can honestly say that everyone seems to have worked hard in their part. From the actors to the backstage team.I'd expect nothing less from Marvel studios and Russo Brothers. I loved every aspect of this movie. That ending left me as well as the entire theater speechless and wanting more. Perfect movie for a perfect series.\nKudos to Russo Brothers for having so many superheroes in one movie and not messing it up.", "By far the best Marvel movie ever! The collection of hero's and the way the split up several different story lines was done masterfully!", "Trailers are meant to make you want to see a film and showcase some of the best moments of a movie to draw your attention. Knowing that trailers are meant to do all of that, it has been a very long time since a movie has been 100x better than the trailer but Infinity War was just that. I was worried the film would feel rushed and generic with forced cameos but I was dead wrong. This was by far the best superhero film I have ever seen. I laughed, cried, and left the theater thinking \"what the hell just happened\"? I highly recommend anyone with the slightest love for Marvel to see this movie. You will not regret it!", "If you're a fan of the previous movies, this film will definitely make you laugh one moment and cry the next. The movie starts an incredibly fast past, largely because the tension has already been built up in the after credits of the previous films (Thano's 2-3 cameos). The star of this film is definitely Josh Brolin, as he displays unique emotional depth as the nihilistic villian Thanos. I don't think I've seen another movie that packs quite so much into the time frame given I wouldn't have cut or added anything. After the film was over, everyone in the theater said something similar to \"I need to go sit down and think about what just happened.\" This is likely due to the emotional shifts, the constant struggle of the characters, and the sense of unending dread the movie makes you feel. I gave this movie 10 stars, because there really isn't any valid criticism to give. This was an incredibly hard movie to pull off and my hat goes off to the guys at Marvel and the directors for being able to do so. I'm excited for Part 2 and the next Phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.", "I think that this film is a very fun, action packed Marvel film. Some of the action is extremely well done and special effects are on point. The relationships between the characters are very good and makes you feel for the characters which makes the deaths even more heartbreaking for the audience. Although this film is extremely good I do think it is slightly overrated. For example, the way Dr Strange can't destroy the stone because he sworn to protect it is a stupid reason to keep hold of an infinity stone and wouldn't he hide it somewhere better than around his neck? Also, the Red Skull appearing with the soul stone didn't make any sense and was a very disappointing location for the soul stone in my opinion. Thanos is a great villain who has clearly lost a lot for whatever he needs the soul stones for and loves Gamora more than anything, except the soul stone? Surely if he loved her that much he wouldn't kill her to get a stone to kill half the universe. I just didn't quite understand why he needed the stones so much and hopefully in part 2 we can find out why.  Basically, it's another amazing Marvel film but has too many faults to beat the first Avengers or Guardians Of the Galaxy.", "I need to start by saying this is a stunning movie. Great CGI, some really funny moments and a genuinely emotional ending.  With a movie so full of household names and established characters, I did wonder how Marvel would fit them all together and tell a solid story. They do both so very well with all the major characters of previous Marvel movies featuring heavily. Thanos was both Sinister and fearless with a few moments of weakness.  Great film, great cast and definitely needs to be watched at the cinema.", "This movie is the definition of epic, I have never in my life seen a movie as good as Avengers IW!!!!! Go see this movie ASAP!!!", "I believe that this is one of the best action superhero movies I've seen in my entire life. Thanos was one of my favorite characters in this particular movie and in general in the Marvel Universe. The whole concept was impressive. The way the story moves is outstanding. A true Masterpiece!!!!!!", "Avengers: Infinity War-the Marvel super-creation carrying the gargantuan expectations of millions of die-hard fans and the buildup of 18 great films before it has finally been delivered to us and all I can say is that it is the best 10th anniversary gift, anyone could ever have wanted. An all-powerful villain, a lineup of all our favorite characters (barring two important ones) and the magic of Marvel make for an invigorating tale of classic good vs. evil where our heroes try to stop a galactic warlord on a murderous agenda to wipe out half the population of the universe by collecting all six infinity stones. The opening is quite grim and the scenes, just from the first five minutes (which directly tie in with Thor:Ragnarok), establish exactly how intimidating, catastrophic and mighty our villain- Thanos is. This also pretty much prognosticates the tone of the rest of the film. Watching Infinity War is like cheering for your beloved team at a highly unpredictable and exciting game of theirs where one moment you're hooting away at the top of your lungs and in the other, you're seeing them going through a low. Yet through all the madness and chaos the film somehow finds stability. It is thrilling to witness the grand entries of the heroes you grew up with and them tossing the bad guys in the air but it is equally so, no matter how heartbreaking as well, to see them fight to the nail, stare hopelessness in the face and still put on a courageous smile and battle on and truly reach their breaking points, for that is what brings out the humanness of them all. Their inability to ignore the guidance of their moral compasses and turn stone-cold like Thanos is one of the big differences that stand out and while it may have seemingly made things tougher for them, is in my belief, that which will hand them victory too.  From edge-of-the-seat anxiety-inducing to hilarious to devastating, this film will take you through a large part of the spectrum of human emotions and yet not once does it tip off balance. The humor is tastefully placed and while admittedly the impact of certain scenes could have been heightened, such small flaws can easily be forgiven just by looking at the artfulness by which the Russo brothers have been able to include so many different characters in such an eventful and complex plot without missing to hold the unwavering attention of the viewers and maintain their heart rates at a constant mark quite surely, slightly above the normal. Apart from this, the different parallel story arcs, too, run meaningfully side-by-side and converge in a finale of epic proportions although the ultimate one is only going to come a whole year later.  Thanos, is given an extra layer of character such that even a being like him, so cruel and madly obsessed with death is shown to have a part of him that knows what love is and that punishes his heart with regret which is something that just enrichens the quality of the slight amount of character development that this film had to do. Also, despite his clearly fearsome personality, the Avengers come infuriatingly close to defeating him at instances and this goes to show that there is still reason to keep hope alive as even Thanos is not invincible. The film's main intention, however, was to tease the overgrown ardor and sentiments attached to every single superhero that appeared and give it all an intensity like never before and it has most definitely done that.  The execution of the action scenes with all their zest and visual flair will leave you awestruck for sure, although in a couple of them the CGI came out a bit tacky. I would recommend watching this movie within the first few days of its release when all the theatres are packed because the environment created by so many people who all love the same thing will take the movie-watching experience to a different state altogether. A glorious feat and achievement and yet another feather in the cap, Infinity war will make you laugh passionately and cry just as much and may even leave you disoriented due to its shocking and brave ending. Do stick around for the post-credits scene though as it sets up what's about to come and will leave you desperately hungry for more.", "I'm shocked wow, everything has come to probably the one of the best movies in the last decade.", "Flawless film hands down!!! 10/10 rating doesn't do Avengers Infinity War justice. It is BY FAR the best of the MCU films. Just from an acting perspective alone it's one of the best films ever! I will probably see this at least 2 more times before it leaves the theater ... in IMAX and in 3D.", "This movie is just great great acting characters development and the ending oh my god \nI Recommend this movie to all of you ppl \nWOOOO000oooo", "Do these things\n-Marvel Entertainment 212-576-4000 (tell them that they killed you)\n-911\n-get a therapist\n-plan a funeral", "First off I truly enjoy all the MCU movies. I know they are not Oscar nominated nor true deeper meaning movies. They are a fantasy world. The movie hits on all aspects of emotions.  Laughter, empathy, anxiousness, and hopefulness. With a cast this large, and ability to not have moments drag through a two and a half hour movie, is quite remarkable.  Peter Parker is a intelligent character. He has the ability to fight with power and agility. In Civil War he figures out how to stop Giant Man. In this film he figures out how to stop Ebony Maw.  Loki is the God of Mischeif only fitting he tried one last trick literally up his sleeve. Incredible Hulk took a beating. Great intro to a highly anticipated movie.  \" You're from Earth?\" \" I'm from Missouri.\" \"That's Earth!\" this banter from StarLord and Stark cracked me up. There were about 5 or 6 moments that made me laugh but that was the funniest joke. I'm glad there wasn't too much humor.  Capt, Scarlet, Vision, and that whole story arch was intense in my opinion. When the battale was about to happen you had to honestly question how they were going to survive that ordeal. It it wasn't for intelligent military strategy on the fly and Thor coming back no one would have survived. Can we take a second on the fact Vision got killed twice. Vision got killed twice.  Lastly Thanos. Most people are discussing the the Gamora death scene which was good but I enjoyed the scene where she said \" I always hated that chair.\" Thanos than says \" I know I heard it everyday.\" For some reason that gave me such empathy for Thanos. Here is a genicide monster who has a love for another person not his blood. For me it was truly heart warming. Yes his methods are insane, in humane, and desperate. He is correct on life wiping itself off existence with too much population, he is not the one to make that call. In his mind he thinks he is and no one else can pull the trigger so to speak. That's what makes him a genicide monster.  Outstanding movie I loved every min of this two hour and thirty eight min movie.", "Excellent result bonding all these heroes and this history line of the last 10 years.!", "Avengers: Infinity War\" was a Good Superhero Epic. But due to it's EXTREME Overstuffed amount of Marvel Cinematic Universe Lore, Characters, No plot, Little to No \"Technical Science\" at all, with Nothing Solved in the movie's Runtime, it falls short of being a Great Superhero/Comic Book Film.  So was this Movie worth the Decade Wait? Well, let be put it this way, if you only cared or enjoyed Marvel's Movies for the \"Spectacle's\" and \"Marvel Action\" in general with your favorite Superhero characters, This movie is for you, But if your looking forward to a Great Superhero Film, Not mention A Great \"Standalone\", with Great \"Justified\" Action, Drama, and Development. Your going to be disappointed. Overall, this movie realistically is a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for an excellent film. It's a Good, Fun, Entertaining, Superhero, Epic, but it's not a Great Movie. Personally, It was Fun, I Yelled and Cheered for my favorite characters with friends in a Sold Out Crowd and that's all I can take away from reflecting on it. On a final note, I wouldn't put this movie in the same ranks or better than \"Logan\", \"Man of Steel\", \"Wonder Woman\", \"Spider-Man 2\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"The Dark Knight Rises\", or \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" as a Superhero/Comic-book Film Masterpiece. It's a Good Epic Movie worth seeing, but nothing more. (7 out of 10 Stars).", "The best Avengers movie to date. And one of the greatest super hero movies of all time. Also one of the biggest cliffhangers in movie history which leaves you wishing that you could see the next one right after you see this one.  Overall a great movie. Wish they could've expanded on some things but they did a great job. And they throw a lot of people off on what they think will happen vs what actually happens.", "The film is a mixture between action, comedy and sad drama. What distinguishes the film is the shocking ending. I think that the number of characters that killed an exaggerated number ... I enjoyed the movie and did not feel the time when watching the film and I was convinced that the film was at its beginning and I was surprised that it ended", "I want to congratulate the producers, writers and directors for having the guts to give us an unpredictable ending. THANOS RULES! This is a fitting and respectable way to end the series and I hope the studio is able to resist any temptation to make more films. Definitely the best Avengers movie and hopefully the last. Don't get me wrong. I have loved the Avengers movies from the very beginning, but just like our lives and most probably the Universe (which will definitively happen much later than our insignificant planet is dead and gone) will come to an end one day, so should this series. And there's no more fitting way to do it than the way it was done in Infinity War, with Thanos sitting calm and relaxed, watching the horizon after a job well done. It was a tough job, but someone had to do it. And, as Thanos already hinted at the end of the movie Age of Ultron, the good old saying also applies to balancing the Universe. If you want something done well, you need to do it yourself. And boy did he do it well! I don't usually give a 10, but this was sheer perfection. Although, the 10 is conditional on the studio ending it here. Thanks again Marvel. This was true shock and awe!", "It is just amazing great story line straight in to the action. All the marvel movies lead to one big one. Just can not wait for part 2", "First of all I've never reviewed any movie ever before.this is the first time..i couldn't resist..the movie is that good!!!..it's by far the best superhero movie ever made..i've watched 1000s of movies from different genres..to this day my favorite movie ever was \"The dark Knight(2008)\"..now it's infinity war..hands down best movie ever made..please watch the movie before you see any spoilers..you won't regret it", "Finally a marvel superhero movie you cant fully foresee whats gonna happen. Perfectly combined major characters. The movie portraits internal struggle for Thanos more than just a pure supervillan. I personally cannot wait to see infinity war 2. And DC will have a hard time catching up for sure .", "Yes people very important cast members were whisked away in ash at the end of the film....it just leaves you wanting MORE in the next of the Avengers series. No doubt a time warp will bring all/most of our heroes back..however i truly believe Loki is actually gone as that scene happened at the beginning of the film...not at the end. Marvel truly did something no other studio would dare to do...create an atmosphere of urgency on what is going to happen next wanting you to WANT more....it's the best marketing tool a studio can dream up leading up to it's ultimate conclusion. Kudos to MARVEL for doing something no other film has even dared to do!!", "This movie has it all. It ties up a lot of loose ends, along with opening new doors for new chapters of the MCU. Every character, good or bad was relevant and had input that was valuable to the movie and not just filling in a bit of screen time. But the true hero of the movie is Josh Brolins fantastic portrayal of the mad Titan Thanos. Had it not been CGI character he could actually be a contender for a major acting award. But this is also thanks to the writers and directors. I would give it a 10, but nothing is perfect. However this is as close to perfect as a comic book movie could ever be. D.C just give up. Again. WOW.", "I will not give away the ending but just to say....WHOA....i believe you will get my drift at the end Overall fantastic film---blending in the Guardians of the Galaxy was just amazing and the comedic level at times was superb!!", "Long story short, this movie will be watched so many more times after the part 2. If you can get the clues this is a omega level setup for the grand exit for Cap and Tony. All of the hints given by Dr. Strange and Thanos himself, point us to events that will happen after this point (or before if you follow a chronological time line). People will love this movie more once they watch Avengers 4.  My guess is Tony and his old pals will be collecting the stones before Thanos by going to the past. Now, how will they go to the past since Thanos has the time gem, you may ask. He is hurt and he may realize that his doing did not get him the result he was looking for. He will do it to recover his loss. Gamora probably is the tipping point. In the soul world, Gamora will be haunting him which will probably cause him to go back. Writers will find a plot device to explain that but that will happen. May be Captain Marvel will have something that will cause it but Avengers 4 will be a huge movie with more action and probably more plot holes (I know it is a bad thing).  Anyways, for today, this is the best MCU has to offer. And it satisfies all my expectations and then some. We are forgetting the nergasms people are having on all the ultimate versions of our heroes. I know many of us would pay the $13 to just see spiderman in those golden tentacles. How about Thor with the storm breaker. I can not believe those youtube reviewers bashing the movie. Dude, you guys are running crazy because of seeing the half ass good looking Venom CGI. This movie has 100 scenes like that.  This movie is a classic that will be talked about for many years to come. People will remember the ending of Avengers 4 but they will all talk about this movie we have.", "Waited 10 years for this masterpiece and I've to say it was worth waiting. Infinity War is the best MCU movie ever. Loved each and every second of it. The ending is gonna leave you in shock. It is gonna be remembered for ages. I have never written any review before but I couldn't stop myself from sharing my thoughts about the movie. A must watch for everyone. Thank you Russo Brothers for making such a spectacular movie. Can't wait for the sequel.", "Watched it, and now i cant stop thinking/ talking about it.\na really must see", "I dont know, when i watched this film. in the first minute iam so excited. because the first minute of this film its continued from thor Ragnarok. and so sad, because we lost Loki. \nBut in the half minute, i felt like this film is force to be longer than what it should. cause you know, this film is about 2,5 hours and we dont know the end. its like, \"what we wait next?\" \nand overall i think this film is worth to watch, because the feeling about lost someone that important to our life is so sad. sooo sadddd. \nthak you.", "I have had the pleasure in watching every Marvel movie since 2008 and it has been a hell of a 10 years of emotions and movie magic.  Avengers Infinity War, by far, is one of the best superhero movies I have ever watched! (SPOILER) Gamora's death left me in tears and also, surprisingly left me feeling for Thanos before Gamora's demise. I have experienced the audience's reactions throughout the whole movie and there were so many expressions. \n(SPOILER) The ending left me speechless... I was overcome with emotions, in a good way. Overall it was an OUTSTANDING 10/10 MOVIE! Thumbs up to the Russo Brothers for this amazing achievement!  Rating: 10/10 SIMPLY BRILLIANT!!", "This movie takes the past 10 years of MCU history and brings together all of our favourite heroes. During the movie we are put into different situations with our heroes, but this is a thanos movie ( Kevin Feige wasn't kidding). We learn lots about Thanos through the course of this movie and see why he is trying to destroy half the universe. \nThe heroes in the movie were amazing with Spiderman getting his new suit to Drax throwing in punch lines all over the place. Interactions between characters was amazing also seeing all these different personalities interact and how they fight together as a team. This movie is very dark with lots of death, but the heroes still make us laugh throughout the movie \nOverall, without spoiling the movie we don't stray too far away from the comics and this movie is really a part 1 to next years avengers 4. You will be on the edge of your seat this whole movie to the end of the credits. Mind blowing movie 10/10", "This film is Avengers at its best! Avengers infinity war is another one of marvals truly amazing films where they are not scared to do things that will shock the viewer. This is the only marval film I have felt that the Avengers and all the of the MCU characters have met their one enemy they can't defeat through just punches and cool abilities. Absolutley amazing and the soundtrack is even better with its more dark tone.  Great film!", "Action packed movie from first scene to the last scene", "This movie makes everyone speechless it is perfect", "This film depicts many stories that come as one for a final battle against an unstoppable tyrant. The stories are all 3 dimensional. The movie moves at a consistent pace where we do not feel too rushed or too slow. There are no parts whatsoever which lack in character. Throughout the film you've got a raging stiffy. This is created through every amount of screen time which shows Captain America. This is not a film that non marvel fans will hate. This is one they shall love. This movie caters to their fans, dropping in Easter eggs here and there. The film will put you in a mental coma. Please watch at your own risk. Batteries not included.  This was written by the residents of the pentagon.\nEach sold separately.\nHot wheels beat that", "As the title says, the best movie ever made until avengers 4.", "This movie is perfectly balanced, as all things should be. This movie is way above my expectations, it is awesome from start to finish. You can feel its weight and it just makes me more and more excited for the future of Marvel Studios.", "After 10 years of genius film writing and making, Marvel has ended it in gobsmacking style. From start to finish the film is filled with comedic scenes. The character interactions, especially Thor with the Guardians and Strange meeting Tony Stark are precious. How can you talk about Infinity War without mentioning Thanos? The antagonist( and protaganist almost) shows his power and his seriousness in the opening five minutes with the murder of Loki. The battle scenes were some of the best I have ever seen in a movie. With the guardians joining the battle, they brought their music and comedy with them. Whilst Thor, Rocket and Teenage Groot head off to obtain Stormbreaker the rest of the guardians meet Stark, Strange and Spider-Man on Titan where a huge showdown occurs with Thanos, not ending well for the heroes.  At the end of the film, the heroes on Earth( Cap, Banner, Nat etc) team up with the Wakandans to stop Thanos from reaching the last Infinity Stone from Vision. Even with the help of Thor, some guardians and the tribes from Wakanda, the Avengers fail to stop Thanos. When Thor thinks he has delivered the killing blow to the mad Titan, Thanos clicks his fingers. Whilst this is all good for Thanos, as we see him looking into the sunset as he said earlier on the movie, the heroes suffer. Many of our favourite heroes, such as Black Panther, Starlord, Spider-Man, Strange and more are all turned to dust in a result of Thanos completing his dream, to destroy half the universe to bring balance.", "It can not be a superhero movie !!\nIt is just insane!!", "So many characters but so well coordinated!Grt script writing, grt direction, grt performances & grt CG!", "I liked all the marvel movies since my childhood but this movie was really really great.You have to watch it.9.7/10", "The best Marvel film ever? ...I think so, jaw dropping brilliant!!!", "Culmination of a decade.You will be in a state of shock when the credits roll.Marvel gave fans what they promised earlier.If you didn't run to the cinema for some reason you should run now.", "It's been building to these 2 films.\nWithin the first 5 minuets I knew this IS THE BEST film from the MCU. It had many answers to questions we've pondered from the start.\nI truly laughed & cried all the way through, over the years these characters have become friends & I felt everything they were feeling.\nThe effects have improved greatly over the years, this film certainly blew your mind, smooth & flawlessly.\nWe are certainly in for a huge treat with part 2.", "Astonishing movie.You will be amazed!All heroes are here to make this summer unforgettable.This is the rare summer film that exceeds ilofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Universe.The Mad Titan (Thanos)is going to face some resistenc from our heroes.But who knows whats going to happen.Maybe our heroes will fail or they may win.But its Marvel and anything can happen.Enjoy!", "Every scene in this movie was worthy digesting and trust me you wont need someone who will disturb you when you go watch this movie.... and of course its a MUST SEE movie, best superhero movie I have ever seen. The villain Thanos, is great, fierce and is deservedly to be named the bets villain Marvel has offered. The accumulation of so many characters was magnificently executed and the plots and story line move in a way that even non-super fans of Marvel can understand. The heroes and heroins were given their best performances and the action sequences will surely makes you jump out of your seat with excitement and goose-bombs too. The jokes are on point however the movie was so emotionally invested and there are some sad moments that surely makes you drop tears like a baby and a lot of surprises to unpack. All a can say is Marvel Studios delivered what it promised and fans will be left with so many questions after watching the movie and hope the untitled Avengers 4 comes sooner than later. Good job Marvel Studios", "Infinity war is Ready Player One for the MCU fans. \nIt has done for its job. Every scenes and dialogues are at the right place.\nIt's the only way to be out of 14000000 options. So I give 10stars with no doubt.", "A very carefully crafted marvel storyline.\nCant just wait for second part of infinity war , let see how thanos continues.", "This movie blew my mind! I can't believe anything that happened and yet I do believe everything. Although this movie had me distraught, I think it is one of the best Marvel movies ever made! I highly recommend this even to people who don't like these movie because you will just be blown away", "That was hell of a movie, they did a very good job", "I am still in shock! You have to see it even if you are not a Marvel fan !", "I wish i could give it more than 10/10 Everything in this movie is perfect, i was afraid that too many superheroes in one movie will make so much distraction.. but it was AMAZING", "One of the best Marvel (Avenger) movies ever... The graphics, acting, visuals, story line and overall action was mesmerizing! Would I recommend this movie to anyone of course without a doubt! I really enjoyed seeing all the superhero's together especially The Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange! I would go and see this movie multiple times if I could and probably I will again!", "This is by far the best Marvel movie ever made! 10 years in the making and is perfect in every way.  Loved how it had 3 stories in the movies for the characters. Guardians of the Galaxy fit in with this perfectly.  Few major characters missing from it but I think it's down to other movies coming out this year that will connect it all.  Can't wait for the next Avengers and the intro fusion of new characters for phase 4!  Thank you Marvel for this masterpiece!", "Hey!\nYes i mean it. Watch this movie before the time runs out. Best of the best. The end will give you big big punch. The only sad part of this movie is that we have to wait patiently for the next year Avengers. Just staggering!!!!\nAnd ya.. just don't miss the post credit scene. I repeat, do not miss..!!", "Loved it, especially the introduction of old characters like the Red Scull. Thanos was magnificent, too often in movies they keep the villain as a mystery but they really give Thanos a lot of screen time and depth of a back story. I believe they have been able to do that by all the heroes back stories being established over the last 10 years so Thanos get the treatment he deserved as a villain.", "Like any other marvel movie. Formulaic in it's story and constantly interrupting it's own tone with typical marvel humor.", "This is the ultimate movie. WOW !!! Absolutely phenomenal", "Avengers infinity wars is by far the most over rated movie I have ever seen I don't understand how it could possibly be the 9th highest rated movie above classics like goodfellas Star Wars a new hope fight club and lord of the rings firstly it's a marvel film which means the plot is very basic a bad guy tries to \"put an end to the universe\" there's been over 67 marvel films with the same plot marvel simply tricks people yong and old to spend money on the same movie 67 times with the only difference being the costume the movie it's self had to many characters and not enough time With some characters such as black panther being seen for probably just over 20 minutes in the 2 and a half hours this film went for being mostly focused on the guardians of the galaxy characters and not the original avengers Thor hulk captain America and iron man overall it was an alright movie thats abit rushed and slightly repetitive (((mild spoiler below))) most people would know from spoilers on Facebook that certain characters might die but I would just like to say that the characters that everyone assumes dies don't actually since one of the characters that appear to die have a sequel of their movie coming out next year", "Avengers infinity wars is by far the most over rated movie I have ever seen I don't understand how it could possibly be the 9th highest rated movie above classics like goodfellas Star Wars a new hope fight club and lord of the rings firstly it's a marvel film which means the plot is very basic a bad guy tries to \"put an end to the universe\" there's been over 67 marvel films with the same plot marvel simply tricks people yong and old to spend money on the same movie 67 times with the only difference being the costume the movie it's self had to many characters and not enough time With some characters such as black panther being seen for probably just over 20 minutes in the 2 and a half hours this film went for being mostly focused on the guardians of the galaxy characters and not the original avengers Thor hulk captain America and iron man overall it was an alright movie thats abit rushed and slightly repetitive (((mild spoiler below))) most people would know from spoilers on Facebook that certain characters might die but I would just like to say that the characters that everyone assumes dies don't actually since one of the characters that appear to die have a sequel of their movie coming out next year", "Can't wait for Avengers4.. We are blessed, many thank u for 10 years, it is the best Marvel movie ever! All scenes of the iron man were amazing, specially Iron Man and Dr Strange they became a great couple! Every year the superhero staff grew, they all became legends, and now it's amazing to see them all together.We are definitely a family with the Avengers.Tony specially you my man.. take care of yourself.", "Avengers: Infinity War surely challenges to be one of the greatest movies of all time. The Russo brothers brilliantly bring together our favourite and most familiar characters from the MCU, from the Avengers, to the Guardians. It starts to tie together all previous Marvel films in a way that exceeded all expectations. With throwbacks and references to the early films (characters unseen since Captain America: The First Avenger) and to the most recent, the film is a roller-coaster of heartbreak, humour, and loyalties. Tremendous praise to the Russo brothers, once again, for culminating so many story lines, so many characters, and so many emotions into one superb film that leaves you on the edge of your seat with your heart racing. Brilliant.", "Infinity war has everything to offer. It has best CGI and thanos actually looked real at some points. Thanos hands down is one of the best CGI villain in superhero movie and second best CGI character after gollum from lord of the rings trilogy. Movie ends on a high note which may anticipates us for avengers 4 and post credit scene which teases us for captain marvel. Acting was top notch and thanos made me believe MCU villain doesn't suck ass. 2 films of marvel in 2018 and we have already got 2 best villain killmonger and thanos. I just want to say this movie is spectacular and must be seen on big screen like IMAX. You simply cannot miss this film. Its a visual treat and lots of unexpected things would come so be prepared for it. I am going for 10/10 because this film can be simply enjoyed in theatres not on laptop or tv screens.\nThank You!", "The Marvel Universe had me literally on the edge of my seat till the very end. I walked out literally light headed. Go See This Movie.", "Every Marvel Movie has lead us to this point, we have seen glimpses of Thanos and now we realize what a Universe at war looks like! Yes that means a really big cast because well the Universe is really BIG! Great Movie and cant wait to see the next one thankfully only a Year away!!!", "This film exceeded expectations it was incredible.", "Simply Amazing.\nwas absolutely blown away by this movie.i think im still in shock.", "What a brilliant Movie, Everything was balanced Thanos CGI and everythin was amazing. Thor was the best part, and wow Tony and Doctor Strange! you guys are massive in it. Brilliant Story and Amazing Timeline with Great Cinematic Experience ever. You cant demand more from the movie! Brilliant! Just cant wait for next!", "This film is just as Good as Civil War. I'm deeply impressed as to how the movie stood very well with the overstuffung of many characters and making every single one of them play a part in this fantastic superhero brawl and mashup! There are little to no subplots, only one goal. This movie did much justice to captivate a true superhero film with your favorites and not so favorites with an impressive villain with a true purpose to stop at nothing until he gets what he wants. One of the top five best films of all time HANDS DOWN! No spoilers, expect the best, and the worst.", "The film opened at 25th April and i have watched it 3 times already. not because it's a good film, but because it's one of the coolest film ever. i mean... we got twenty something superhero that we've followed since the first Iron Man from 2008, and we got to see Thanos that has appeared in the first Avengers. But my worries has come true. would it be enough to put twenty something superheroes including bring together some of them for the first time, telling a lot of jokes (some of them REALLY unfunny and appeared at a bad timing), intorducing the three dimesional character that Thanos possess, some great battle sequence, and then finding the stones, and actually a lot more. well, somehow they managed to push them into 2 and a half hours film, but it felt rushed. the relationship between Thanos and his daughter Gamora felt so plastic even though that is one of the tools for the audience to get to know Thanos better. and a lot more issues. but it;s still a cool and very risky film to make, dozens of stars, more than 3 complex plots filled with different characters that contrast to each others, i still have to give it a props. and the ending is worth waiting btw, really breathtaking.", "Just. Perfect\nBut fu Quill, you screwed it all op\nI'm really looking forward to see CM fix it all", "Best movie ever and i so exciting for second part ..

Brutal and dark at times but still with that classic Marvel comedic charm to break it up.\nThought the way the characters were written into the story was brilliant and clever, it can't have been easy trying to decide what happens with so many superheroes involved. All in all my favourite Marvel film to date. Thanos was exactly what I wanted and his Children were brilliant.  Epic.", "War, Surprises, Death, Sad Moments, Funny Moments, Some Wanted and unwanted Deaths, Returns That's all this movie is about... I can say that after watching this has created intense hunger to watch the upcoming movie", "\"Dread it, run from it. Destiny still arrives.\" I remember walking into the theatre to watch 'The Avengers' in 2012 and completely awed by it. After that, I watched all the Marvel movies in theatre (except Spiderman). I saw Thanos' smirk at the end and thought we'd see him in the sequel very soon. It took 6 goddamn years. And now I've watched it, the movie that all the previous ones were leading up to.  The expectations were already high and I was doubting how they were going to top Civil War which was my favourite Marvel movie. I was glad the Russo's directed it because they did a MARVELous job.  From the first scene till the last one, I was on the edge of the seat. It did everything it should and even more. It wasn't an Avengers movie, it was Thanos' movie. We already learnt about all the other good guys, so they focused the most on Thanos. And Thanos became my favourite MCU villain. Not only was he scary but also had emotions with some of the characters. He's not just a villain who wants to destroy, he had his reasons. (That's what I loved about Magneto too).  BFI IMAX 3D felt like a rollercoaster ride that I would love to try again and again. The visual effects were spectacular, much better than Black Panther. The action scenes were some of the best I've seen. There were so many scenes during which the entire theatre just cheered and clapped. Even I clapped until my hands hurt. It was that exciting. The score, of course, is amazing.  The ending. I was just shocked. (It's like GoT + Superhero movies). I praise them for having the balls to do it. I doubt even DC would do it. Bravo for that. I was satisfied with it but I do think that's not the real ending. But I'm excited to see how they're gonna pull it off.  Overall, it wasn't just a movie, it was an experience. So far, I couldn't find any major flaws that affected my experience. I had ton of fun. That's what matters. I'm going rewatch it 'infinite' times. Again, I love movies in general, and I'm not a huge Marvel fan. But seeing those characters in a movie like this were so thrilling. I'd rate 10/10 because it was a hugely difficult job to pull off and they did it.", "This film was a very enjoyable experience and was packed with many great scenes and blended the groups well as the light hearted super heroes were completely separated from the more somber ones.", "As my brain scrambles from scene to scene in an attempt to relive the significance of its originality I've come to the conclusion that this was everything I expected and more. \nThe jump from different city to different planet to different spaceship was relentless but I suppose it just had to be, right? The Russo brothers have given every thought to every single character in this film and has made them all feel as equally as important within the main plot. \nAs for that main plot, well Mr. Brolin may have just written is name down in iconic villain folklore alongside the likes of Mr. Vader and that clown from that other universe... He shows us why he is 'the biggest and baddest villain yet' and makes our heroes seem so 'tiny and small'. \nOur heros are as appealing, warm and heroic as ever as they put their differences aside to challenge this apocalyptic threat. There's no time for getting to know each other, it's all hands to the deck right from the off! \nHeading towards the climax the Russo brothers have still managed to keep you guessing right until the grand finale. Then it hits you, like a golden gauntlet to the face!\nThe question is, how am I supposed to wait another year to find out if the swelling has gone down?", "I literally had my mouth wide open when I saw the end credits... I want to know when is the next part coming out and how this is going to end.  But do keep in mind one thing.... you should be in line with the previous superhero movies to get through Avengers: IW... else your are lost.... Thanos... Thanos... Thanos... the super villain...", "The beSt super heros movie ever\nGrreeeeat\nWatch it now noooow\nIts not only 10/10 it's 20/10", "Great film! No spoilers so not much else I can say. Cannot wait for next chapter! When does the next one come out?", "This is saying a lot considering I'd hyped it up all the week prior by rewatching the last 18 Marvel movies, and I was still shell shocked. This movie took my expectations and obliterated them, it's a nigh perfect culmination of subplots and characters like I never would've expected, and the ending... truly gripped me. If you haven't seen the prior MCU movies I would not recommend watching this one yet simply because you'd have very little time for character development with each character; there's a reason for the 18 movies prior. However, if you're a Marvel fan, or even someone that's just caught up on the MCU movies and not necessarily a die hard fan, you can safely go in with high expectations, as the unprecedented ending and plot will leave you shaken with surprise.  Note:\nI would largely ignore the negative reviews if they mention 'compared to DC' or anything about DC, as the rivalry between DC and Marvel has made DC fans incredibly angry and jealous to say the least. To say the least they will negatively review the movie regardless of the actual movie itself if it falls under the Marvel name.", "Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. \nThis is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under \"popcorn film\" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure, This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of \"everything is gonna be alright\" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come.\nLove See how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie. and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. It's The Most famous movie at the moment in Sri Lanka and I'm sure marvel will appreciate how much of a help Sri lanka is giving to the box office records! Cheers! Weldone! :) :) :)", "The Avengers Infinity War is kind of like the Iron Giant meets Lord of the Rings, Tony Stark meeting Doctor Strange. The plot is about as linear as the VR world of Real Player One. Only Real Player One was a video game.", "Everything I hoped for and then some. Well worth the 10 year wait. I had my doubts but Thanos delivered. 10/10", "I don't usually write reviews but this movie was amazingly awesome!!! I couldn't believe what I was seeing on the screen. It has so many twists and turns that you will be like \"WHAT!!\"  The movie had a really somber and dark feel to it and there were some intense scenes (I won't spoil it). \nThis is a must see!!!", "I have no words to express how good it was! You HAVE to watch it. It's a must!", "I love the Marvel's unique conviction in its distance to \"chosen\" heroes in its strong belief and affection in cohabitation of diverse every humane heroe's affection. That includes Ironman and Spider-Man Dr.Strange Rabit Groot Gamora etc all the diverse life based on their core idea to live together in peace without fear in the universe space without violent conquer. This all star movie Avengers Infiniti War, however, or, exactly saying, that is why, teases audeiemce's strong tendency to rely on all star heroes power. Marvel, as it always does, describes the real world where killers go on killing in \"justification\" of any sorts of even in manipulation of mentality and humane strength and weakness in love and hate. Avengers Infiniti War - is exactly the world of truth seriously commuting to and diggin into reality with humour, in reflecting exactly the real world where I and all star casts or even producers directors all the Marvel studio itself facing up with in every day production process and every day life of their own. That was even shown in its reflection of the latest \"science\" to be technically implemented into real practical weapon in near future. \nAnd that is why this movie is \"to be continued\" in audiences' sense of sadness in the sadness (in a sense of expected even without any spoiler\" ) and asking or putting audiences into the position to think of the measures that they can do to solve the situation with production. This movie is dragging audience into the bottom of the mud where this world or areas have been sticking into. Marvel movies Ironman Spider-Man Avengers etc including Avengers Infiniti War are brilliant because Marvel movies always bring audience into the real problems the earth is facin up with in its very unique way that no other film can do but marvel movies", "Best marvel movie yet recommend this for any marvel fan!", "My title basically sums it up. I loved the movie: funny, witty, and the storyline has plenty of twists and turns with non-stop action that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The only downside is that it's a lot to take in. Watch up on all of the previous movies Marvel has made and be ready to juggle a ton of different connecting scenes.", "This film left me sitting in my seat heartbroken, but satisfied until the next. The score of the film and the cinematography were amazing, though it was a lot packed in to 2 hours and 40 minutes.  Marvel usually has trouble making good villains that stick with you, but Thanos was a monster.", "Loved the movie. I should not have gone to the late show. I. Was. Not. Ready.... I was up until nearly 3 am Googling stuff. I just need part 2 to happen like tomorrow!", "If you've been following the MCU since the beginning then the payoff this movie offers is incredible. An incredible Cast, and an incredible story offer one of the best superhero movies of all time, if not the best.", "Great movie with lots of not all your favorite Hero s. But the greatest is Thanos. Never have I seen a marvel movie and felt Some connection to the villain. \nWith all the s**t he does....he still is a character with depth. Great work from Josh Brolin", "A towering achievement in modern day blockbuster storytelling, Infinity War hits hard right out of the gate, and continues to pummel you with spectacle beyond compare throughout its nearly three hour run time. \nWhile it's thrilling to see so many amazing characters meeting, and sharing the screen, make no mistake, this is very much a film about Thanos. Brolin's performance as the Mad Titan shines throughout the film. He is both bombastic and nuanced. Terrifying, and fallible. Thanos is now by far the MCU's most fantastic and interesting villain. \nWeaving together so many characters and storylines could easily have gone horribly wrong, but the Russo brothers navigate it seamlessly as they take us through the story, and from planet to planet at an almost break neck speed. It's no surprise that it's thrilling and hilarious to see Tony Stark interact with Doctor Strange, or Thor banter with Star Lord. Every character gets their moment and their chance to shine a bit(Spiderman and Doctor Strange were both standouts for me personally)even if that's all they get. Because the film never really slows down, you shouldn't expect a lot of character growth, or deep narrative arcs for any of our heroes. We've had eighteen films for that, and this is about seeing them all play and interact in this world together. This is an event film after all, and can really only be judged in the context of the MCU's entirety. There's no denying that Infinity War's greatest weakness is its assumption that you are very invested in these characters and storylines. So when I sit back to judge its quality as a film, I do so as a fan of the franchise and as someone who has seen all the films many times. Basically what I'm saying is there is no way for this film to really stand alone. If you haven't seen or didn't like most of the other MCU films, you will be very confused right from the start. \nIn the end, this film absolutely belongs to Thanos, and we are all the better for it. Grade: A-", "In time, you'll know what it likes to lose! Just wow, the Directors have my respect to end this huge movie this way, we all see that marvel's studio had such a perfect details during these years as you seen that finding the soul stone scene was amazing full of emotions and surprises! How they pull down the heros and taking them up again. \nI just think that the erased characters will come back in parallel universe or another timeline or something else with rare memory about what happened and gonna find it out. But as the wisard said, this was the only way so they absolutely will come back. \nGreat movie! Everything was perfect and enjoyably enough!", "Bold to its core , such an appalling conclusion and greatest villain yet", "Edit: I managed to not watch trailers or learn anything about this movie until the night I watched the film, and that made it 10000X better, though it makes me come off naive because I was not aware this was only part one of two when writing this.\nI think this movie is incredibly well done, especially if if their goal is to leave me begging for more and really hit me where it would hurt. I want to start by complimenting the composer, they seamlessly intertwined their pieces into the film and it was breathtaking. The whole movie kept me on my toes and went beyond anything I could have ever imagined. At many moments I could also feel the tears start to well up, though none of those feelings compared to the complete anguish that came over me watching Peter Parker begins to disintegrate. As he scrambles to grasp onto Tony, begging that he does not want to go, though eventually disappears (proceeding as well as preceding many Avengers being whisk away in mere minutes in the film) my heart broke.\nThis film brought together more characters from the franchise than ever before, and although I do wish Paul Rudd and Clint Barnes would have joined in, I was thoroughly impressed by their ability to bring together so many actors.\nWhen the credits began to roll I was quite enraged, but I give serious kudos to the creators for really going out on a limb and not following the traditional idea of keeping most of all of the main heroines alive. I was left stunned in my seat, unsure whether I could recover from the devastation I had just watched unfold. I felt the emotions of the characters and I laughed quite a bit as well. On another note, I wish I could throw myself into my studies with as much passion as I have put into this review.", "It's impossible to talk about this movie without spoiling something, so I just say GO watch this movie, it's fun, it's action, it's drama... it's MCU on it's highest values. Thanos is amazing, all Marvel's fan will get some easter eggs, the movie is AMAZING and it's clearly showing the world how you can build a full Universe of Movies connected, put them ALL together and get HYPE going on with GREAT quality and ideas. DC, shame on you... Marvel did it again, and probably, will keep on doing it.\nIt's amazing how Kevin took such a risky move and showed us how you can make something work when you LOVE what you are doing, and work hard.\nThanks to all the directors, actors and everyone that dedicated time to build up this movie, I pretty sure that ALL the ppl that saw the film that day on the cinema, got 2:30 hours of JOY that will not forget for a VERY long time. We were childs again, adults and happy at the same time. And I'm pretty confident to say, that the same will happen to many many more ppl in the following days, weeks and months. GO SEE IT ! NOWWWWW :)", "This is my first time ever writing a comment on IMDB. I haven't much to write about this movie. Just go and watch it. Absolutely mind blowing. Epic is just a word that cannot describe what I witnessed.", "The movie plays with your feelings and is beautiful to look at", "Where shall I start? Little spoiler is going to be shared, which is rather a theory of mine, so you can read it till the last part . ;) This is my first review, and since I saw this movie yesterday, I had a feeling that this is the perfect movie to lose my IMDb review virginity. Honestly, wasn't a big fan of Marvel's latest installments, neither Ragnarok nor Black Panther. I wasn't expecting too much from this either, however was hyped enough to watch it asap because of the cast, the great deal of likeable characters, and was really curious how they can be put together. Didn't think it was possible in any ways, that still keeps up the story and not be ridiculous and unbalanced. I was wrong... Incredibly wrong. We were in a good mood with my friends, discussing the theories, the background story, characters, etc. before the movie began. Afterwards it started? Not a single word was said, all of us were completely sucked in from the first moment till the very end of the credits - not new, nor spoiler, you must wait till the very end as you learnt through the years. As I said, the Russo brothers made an excellent job of creating this blockbuster. There are many hilarious moments and phrases, perfectly matching and timed, the characters came together are amazing, with the chemistry and importance put on a level that each of them required, simply amazing job -however a few jokes were maybe a little too much, that's why I gave 9, however I'd give 9.9 if it was possible. Thanos is incredibly well made, he's the perfect villain the MCU have been long waiting for. The humour and the seriousness are perfectly balanced. Unfortunately cannot say more without spoiling the experience, YOU MUST WATCH IT! Spoiler, which is my theory. Read after you are over the movie. ;)\nSince AntMan is not in the movie - at least in a visible way - I assume, that Thanos' gauntlet gets broken in the end after he did what he did, as he is inside ruining it in a micro size. Therefore, what Strange mentioned that there is only 1 possible solution to defeat Thanos, is I think, that he must be believed in his victory, in order to ever remove his gauntlet by feeling safe and done, and that is when the AntMan comes and gets it to make everything back in balance by somehow stealing it and going back in time by the help of the remaining heroes, probably Wong included. Mark my words - which is maybe a hope, that it will not stay as it is in the end.  PS: Mark Ruffalo spoiled more than my review like 9-10 months ago, which many believed was a marketing strategy, well, it certainly was not. ;)", "Once again, Marvel surprises. \nWith this film, she was able to demonstrate that her 10 years producing films have resulted in a FANTASTIC MOVIE, SPECTACULAR IN ALL SENSES. To begin with, the work of the Russo Brothers and the writers themselves is impressive, the work the writers had to adapt a comic to a movie, so that everything works beautifully. It is simply spectacular.\nThe work of the directors is also and was very important to transmit the script to the screen and it was made in a way that the scenes are beautiful, the camera movements are very good. The picture in this movie is beautiful. In my opinion, the best work in the MCU from The Russo Brothers. The soundtrack, to me, is one of the best and most striking of the Avengers films, and every use they give it, is spectacular.  Leaving the technical details, the writers have created such a good script, that each character has its moment to shine, even for a short time, from extras to the main characters. In question to the villain, it is without a doubt, the best villain MCU ever had, is a villain with a purpose, but although it has these goals, is a humanized villain thanks to the script. That is, we understand his goals and feel anger, agony and pity for it.\nThe tone of the film is different from the other films, a little bit more darker than the last Russo Brothers' movies, but that dark tone has a purpose, it is used to exalt the villain. And for those who are worried about humor, I just say this, it is well mixed with the action and has its due moments.", "The film itself was great, and seeing several of the main cast get wiped out was an impressive feat, but the fact it's no secret that there will be a new Spiderman film next year and a new Guardians of the Galaxy not long after that immediately tells you the deaths will be reversed which made me feel a little cheated. \nI think Marvel really made a mistake here and shouldn't of announced the upcoming movies until after the next Avengers film, so that people do genuinely believe the characters are gone.", "This film is everything that you were hoping it would be. The characters are as alive as they have ever been, you will find yourself heartbroken at times and you will find yourself laughing. They did such a good job at combining several characters together in this film. Thanos was an incredible villain, he was very intimidating and scary--yet you could feel slight sympathy for him at times. Let me also add that I feel that this film had the best post credits scene of all time, at least for me. Those who have been anticipating this moment in the MCU will be freaking out when they see the post credits scene. I KNOW I WAS. Incredible film, yes of course there are some flaws but all movies have flaws. This movie is nothing short of a great movie, especially for those who like the comics.", "Was as funny as any Marvel movie but definitely not funnier. I choked up more during this than during any other Marvel movie. Higher stakes and loss equals more emotion. Tons of action. Cliffhanger at the end leaves you wondering what's next. Best villain of any Marvel movie, by far. I still feel like there were some missed opportunities, but the job the Russos did of juggling this many characters and keeping it this good is quite a feat.", "Best one so far! Can't wait for next one. Way too long to have to wait", "Avengers: Infinity Wars, is an epic saga from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as the Avengers rebel against the existential threat that is the overwhelming might of the supreme Thanos\nThe heroes of the narrative (Downey, Pratt, Johansson and the rest of the gang) are in excellent fighting form (as per usual) and bring undertones of organic humour (particularly Ruffalo and Holland) to balance the impending doom. \nBrolin's, Thanos is an infallible, and unmatched talent among previous Marvel Cinematic Universe villains. The leading antagonist (Brolin) could potentially challenge Heath Ledger's maniacal depiction of the Joker. This is not because Thanos is a megalomaniac and indomitable being, but his excellency lies rational. He is deft and absolute in both words and actions. He displays something inexplicably and hauntingly human about him. Thus, making him a fully realized anti-hero.\nAlan Silvestri's beautiful layered soundtrack heightens the emotional intensity of the Avengers greatest threat to date. His ability to capture the constantly changing tone and as the inextricably linked narrative jumps from place to place is deserving of praise. \nThe Russo's Infinity Wars (Part 1) is sure to become a pop culture reference of the future, as they have managed to achieve with the Thanos and the Avengers what Bryan Singer failed to do with Apocalypse (a character of banal platitude) and the X-Men. But we are left with our appetites unsated, and waiting with both repressed clamour and bated breath for the conclusion of the enthralling and dynamic journey in 2019.\n-RJ", "The best movie of the series yet! I just could not believe that there were so many action scenes and thrilling scenes. For the first time the emotional scenes were not stupid and just laying around. You can't expect something more from a movie of this kind. Now the bar is set really high I hope they can keep up!", "Dramatic, exciting & humoristic as one.\nStory is very easy so you don't have to watch all other Marvel movies. Except The Guardians of the Galaxy so that you know the chemic of the squad.", "I am not a super hero movie kind of person but this is absolutely amazing. So well put together great character building humor and all around awesome.", "The past 10 years since the first Iron Man I have been invested in this series and this is what it all has been building up to and I can say it was more than worth the hype. This movie really was something different for a Marvel film and that's what made it amazing. Not only did the movie have its classic humor that everyone loves it even had MAJOR emotion. Another thing was the MAJOR deaths and that had me all kinds of screwed up because all the characters I've known were gone in an instant. But other than that bit it was a great movie.", "This is for sure the GREATEST MARVEL FILM EVER ! Infinity War was brilliant on every category: Story, Visual Efffects, Music, Villain, Emotions. You will need to see this in theaters to live every single moment of this movie !", "I have been a major fan of the MCU since it's beginning, starting with the first Hulk move that was made. My love only increasing with the first Iron Man. If you are as big of a fan as I am, this movie should be a top priority. I can't even begin to describe the utter beauty of this movie. I was crying, laughing, crying, getting chills, laughing again, crying again, and so on. Marvel has outdone themselves with the CGI and effects in this movie, as everything looks incredibly real. You see emotions, the tiniest movements, and incredibly realistic wounds in the faces of some CGI characters. They are just so real. Don't let other reviews fool you when they say the plot of this movie sucks. I felt it was incredibly well-driven, even though this feels like 2-3 movies put together. But who wouldn't want to see multiple movies flowing together into one? Isn't that why we all love the MCU so much? The characters were amazing (as always). The Black Order was incredible, as each of them could have been standalone villains in their own movies. Thanos was just the best villain I have seen in any movie in a long time. I empathized with him, hated him, and had that moment where I was like, \"You know? He's kind of right. But he's still a jerk.\" Just, all I have to say is Marvel truly outdid themselves. The ending is just...wow. They could not have carried that out any better than they did. Perfection. I found nothing wrong with this move. (Well, maybe just one thing: Where did Wanda's accent go??)", "Wow. Watched it five times so far, absolute spectacle. I've never been more emotionally and mentally beaten after a film - credit to the Russo's. You can read all the 10* reviews on here, so I'll keep it short. Josh Brolins' Thanos is better than Heath Ledgers' Joker. What a performance. That is how you culminate a story - what character development! Also Thor, Drax, Iron Man, Gamora, Doctor Strange and Star Lord shine here. Actually everyone is at their best! Holy sh**", "I expected a lot about Infinity War.But the movie was beyond my imagination. It broke all my expectations.I didn't expect a movie like this.I am damn sure that this movie is one of the best MCU movie ever made.I still wondering how Russo brothers managed to direct this movie with many characters.I was tensed about the movie how would be the scenes with many characters.But Russo brothers managed it well.The movie was super.Entry of each characters made me excited.I was anxious what would happen next n each scenes.The climax of the movie really made me shocked.It was a great surprise for me.And it made llittle tension in me.It made me to wait for the next Avengers movie.I can't wait to watch the next Avengers movie.But unfortunately the next movie will release only next year.I am sad about that.But I will wait for it.Finally the movie was a great experience.", "This is what the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date was working towards. It's the culmination of 10 years of interwoven plots and character arcs. And boy, does Avengers: Infinity War deliver. The movie manages to find an almost perfect balance of action, drama, and humour (there a couple of truly hilarious scenes). While the movie is long with 2 hours, 40 minutes of running time, it never feels so. If you are a fan of the past MCU installments, you will find this to be one of the best movies of the series, that will shake to you to the core. But this leads me to essentially the biggest problem of the movie: it's pretty much exclusively targeted at hardcore fans of the MCU. While you (most likely) will be able to follow the plot, you will have a hard time to untangle the web of relationships between the heroes, to unstand how they got in their current situation, and in some cases even to identify them: a couple of major characters never even gets addressed by name once in the whole movie.  In addition, it will be difficult to feel emotional attached to the heroes. While every of the protagonists gets their moment to shine, there's very little characterisation or even development. A small number of crucial characters get a single emotional scene, or maybe two, but this is barely enough to make you sympathetic to their plight. Pretty much all of your investment in the heroes will have to come from the previous movies of the MCU. On the other hand, the movies antagonist Thanos gets thoroughly characterised and fleshed out. This is what makes Avengers: Infinity War really special and standing out in the mass of MCU movies. A villain with true depth. While his actions are cruel and atrocious, he doesn't act out of a wanton lust for destruction but rather out of a twisted sense of duty and even a perverse way of... kindness. Josh Brolin's subtle motion-captured performance further helps to make Thanos despite his bloodthirsty savagery appear human and almost relatable.", "For the last 10 years Marvel has led up to this. All your favorite characters in one movie for an ultimate showdown. But if you aren't familiar with any MCU film before, you'll be completely lost. This is the cliffhanger-season finale of your favorite show. So brush up on your Marvel knowledge if it's been a while and sit back because this may be the best MCU flick to date.", "Avengers Infinity War was based of the 1991 publication Infinity Gauntlet. In terms of scale, the movie was done well to translate to the big screen. There's no way it could have been done as it played out in the comics as the latter series of Infinity Gauntlet involved Marvel's comics entities(Eternity, Galacticus, The Watchers, The Celestials, etc...) and that would have been way too much. Although it would be very cool to have one or two show up in the final installment to say lend a helping hand and receive and introduction into the MCU. I've read other reviews where it stated that certain deaths lacked emotional punch as they were killed or eliminated only to have their deaths reversed in the final installment. Well, that's how it works in the comics. Death has way since been handled as temporary in both Marvel and DC comics. The other deaths that appeared to be more permanent were done well and I doubt those characters will resurface. There were some characters whose power sets seemed to get amped up quite a bit, i.e. Captain America while others seemed dialed down. Therefore, the way they were handled in battle made them seem a bit like some baby Hulks. And given how formidable Thanos would be with just one stone, the battle sequences were done well to provide the viewer with a sense of legitimacy. Because as shown in the comics, he could have easily defeated many of the characters in the movie with one or two stones, let alone five as he had when he arrived on Earth. I thought Thor's arc was handled well and he was finally given some scenes that actually provide some insight on his true power set and what he is capable of. So outside of the ignant mofos that sat behind and talked most of the movie, it was quite an enjoyable bit of escapism. Thanos was believable and given how much had to be played out in the movie, his character was well done with just enough character development to understand his motivation. The 2 hour 40 minute running time seems to fly by. It's pretty much 0-60 within the first 10 minutes of the movie. So give it a go. If you're a fan boy, you'll understand why much of the movie was shot and made the way it was. Those who don't read comics may have a harder time suspended their sense of belief. Titan was shown as more of a planet as opposed to a moon which it is. That Earthlings could survive on a moon of Saturn without some type of armor or space gear is beyond me. But maybe I'm nitpicking. Go check it out, you'll enjoy yourself.", "I couldn't find any bad thing about the movie, it was epic!", "I don't think I can ever recall the last time, if ever, I was anticipating a movie of such magnitude and excitement.\nAfter watching this movie I'll keep this review short and sweet as I am indeed at a complete loss of words but all I can say is, I am completely mesmorized, mindblown and somewhat emotional over from start to finish. I wish I had Marty McFly's Deloreon or the timestone to forward to April 2019. \nA complete masterpiece Marvel. Bring on Avengers 4!!!", "Absolutely an amazing experience! The movie has been filmed awesomely around the presumed storyline. It evokes mixed emotions and is capable of holding you still for the time it runs. This masterpiece is certainly the result of hard work of every single individual named in the cast and credits.", "This is truly the ending (first half) of the 18 MCU movies. If you are not familiar with the stories and characters leading to this point, you will not have the greatest fun possible in watching this movie. But if you do, this movie is nearly a masterpiece! The mix and match of characters from different movies are done witfully. Most of the lines are carefully written and effective in bringing comedy, nostalgia and emotion. And like all other Marvel movies, you can find pure excitement from cool action scenes and beautiful CGI. People may say this movie has weak character development. It's true, because all the development are done in the previous movies already! This movie has so much to deliver and it wastes no time in doing things unnecessary for long time Marvel viewers.  This may not be a prefect movie, but this is the one that fans need and love. Hats off to the creators who must have paid immense amount of effort in making this epic superhero symphony.", "Literally perfect, everything we wanted and needed it to be.", "Best movie ever!!!! Easily one of the best movies of all time. If not the best", "No Spoilers, just reference to trailers. Going into this movie I had seen countless reviews from both critics and fans alike. Some people suggesting that this isn't even one of the best movies in the entire MCU. So I went in with mixed expectations.  Firstly, I'm not a huge Marvel fanboy, I wasn't even a huge fan of some of the recently popular films like Black Panther and Homecoming which I thought could've been far better. I loved Infinity War and I honestly don't know how I didn't go in expecting to, because halfway through the movie I was literally looking at a friend in amazement because of how awesome the movie was.  A lot of the criticism of this movie are towards the following; The ending, uncharacteristic behaviour, black order cgi, strength relativity based on other movies/comics, screen time (which I find hilarious), tone, and anticipation of this movie.  I will try and keep this brief The Ending - People either love it or hate it. But I definitely think people hate it for the wrong reasons. All I can say is that, for the most anticipated movie of all time, it is amazing that despite all the theories I read, I was pleased that I was still surprised by how things turned out by the end. The execution was great as well and mostly made sense. Uncharacteristic behaviour - I literally think ONE character was unusual throughout the movie. With so many other characters bringing their game, I literally could not have cared less. There was also one blatantly stupid move which ruined everything in a moment that I felt was unbelievable. Thats it though...plenty going on otherwise. CGI for Black Order - I say specifically the Black Order because no one can argue that this isn't one of the most gorgeous movies out now, and I don't just mean in the action sequences. The Black Order I thought were fine, its just its in comparison to how amazing Thanos looked. It never took me out of the moment. I for one just appreciated their design. Strength Relativity - This I think is the most complicated thing for people to understand about Marvel movies especially. Sometimes I understand the criticism, in the sense that, some people just shouldn't be as powerful as others (e.g. Black Widow is not as powerful Scarlet Witch) and yet they clearly are in the movie. Again these instances are minor. However, what annoys me is the - \"why didn't he just do that earlier\" argument, or \"why can't he just do that thing he did before\". In general, I think that those are people going into this movie asking to hate, in the sense that they go into this movie with the mindset that it will be a popcorn movie. You cannot enter the movie with that mindset. I would love to go into detail about this but it would take forever. Essentially its almost like asking why we walk or jog if we can sprint. People, regardless of their nature have limits, especially in intense situations. It happens in action and people need to get over it. Essentially, most of the fight scenes are incredible, some outstanding, but you have to be smart about them without being too smart to fully enjoy them. Screen Time - For all I care, they could've cut out a few more characters and I would've still been ecstatic to see most people joining together cause when they did, it was awesome. Yes - some pairings work far better than others, this is true. But again, only because those pairings are literally amazing. The pairings that weren't as good were simply the ones that met my expectation. E.g. Captain America and Black Panther are obviously not going to be as fun as Strange and Tony. And yes not all the characters were in the movie. Its has a limited runtime, and there is another one coming next year. It shouldn't be a criticism for the movie because it asking for more where there is already so much. It's like complaining about owning an island because you wanted a country, it's a ridiculous criticism. Tone - I can't understand how someone can't appreciate the rollercoaster of emotions this movie provided. A cinematic experience should be one that makes you feel strongly and the highest praise I can give this movie is, these days, you go into great movies that excel in two genres at most. This movie almost excelled on its comedy, action, thrill and drama altogether. The most pleasantly balanced movie I've ever seen. Anticipation - As I said earlier I have seen some ridiculous criticism for this movie. I didn't go into this movie with the anticipation in my mind. I didn't go in wanting it to be the best movie in the world. Nor did I go in with lowered expectations, I went in as Thanos would've said \"Perfectly balanced\". I think that a lot of people went in with some unrealistic expectations, something thats easy to do with this movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet go and see it, preferably in a packed cinema because as I said before, it is one for an audience. The is the highest 9/10 I could ever give. It misses out on a 10 because it is not perfect, only because it could've been even better than it was. It frustrates me because if it was, this would easily be one of the best movies I have ever seen and will ever see. Nevertheless I believe its fair to say it lived up to the hype and the hype was huge.", "This movie is just great. It's got thrills and it's got chills and it's got moments that make you want to scream about how freaking awesome the scene is. No spoilers but the ending, though sort of predictable if you listen to what they're saying in the film, is crazy. I really enjoyed it. Would give a 12/10 if I could", "THIS WAS THE BEST ONE OF ALL . DONT WASTE TIME GO AND SEE IT NOWW", "Avengers: Infinity war is a solid base foundation that wastes not an ounce of time in setup territory. Instead, the more relevant plan is just to do the things that the first eighteen MCU movies have long been leading up to, being a decade for that matter.  First up, the action is an absolute win factor that frequently elevates the movie in the direction it should be going right where it initiates. The script-writing with essential MCU humor remains intact as to be usually expected. Both the heroes and villains have their equal bargain of screentime. And to put the lackluster theory to rest, Thanos alongside the rest of his forces attributes to one of the more significant beings of villainy thus far. The cameos and particularly some eye-popping returns are perhaps the ultimate power up mid way through. It really does however feel as though the element that gets this ambitious threequel stirring along is the dynamics between characters typically as they encounter one another for the first ever time. Just when it seemed like the pace might be draggy and formulaic, it really wasn't. Only the shuffle might not necessarily have been executed at peak level. Now just to make things fairly simple, the teamwork in every action scene is enough to keep you intrigued. The duration per action scene isn't quite as long enough, thereby making it seem that Civil War's airport battle remains the top tier contender for a well earned time being.  Spider-Man is great but it feels like his whole depiction works in the MCU more by weakness than strength. Comically, it works. But maybe his stakes could broaden up in the future. I get that there were plenty of others too. The X-Men/ FF deal isn't here too soon for a live action crossover. Maybe now we'll relish the blast of the Avengers and Guardians together. Fair enough, I'd reckon. The visuals felt breathtaking and genuinely on point. What's with these trailer shots that don't make the cut anyway?  The adventure this movie sets foot upon doesn't weigh down the plotlines. Yet it would seem that characters exist, do their stuff. Maybe not as hugely as a collection as any wild expectation ought to get. Maybe Civil War was where the Russos timed the juggle right, and this time the priorities seemed like a shift from previous executions. It's thankful enough to say this movie didn't have any setback that made it suck. The sound editing is suitably good. The final act felt reasonable and delivered a fistful of Thanos mayhem. But I'd rather refer to this movie as a combination of heroes than a culmination of efforts. I'm already betting on the next Avengers movie to embark the grander way to prominence.  Oh yes, got to love the post credit scene.  In the end, Infinity War works as much as a teamwork crossover event as it does as a villain biopic depiction. It has enough contention of its own to rank its way to the top MCU movie depending on how you look at it. I haven't listed any spoilers, even though I pretty much read all I could before even watching it. Well, it's my thing as my criteria goes about knowing stuff beforehand and seeing how it plays out in the result. But others probably do not feel the same way so this is entirely spoiler free. I'd hoped for a complete 10 star rating. I really did. The stakes couldn't be better. But I'm starting to think I miss Whedon's work.", "This is not only a film this is a story which everybody need to know... marvel had arrange the story very well... all the expectation were fulfilled.. nice thrill and action.... waiting for the avengers 4", "Infinity War will be one of the best films of the year, with film directors making a great film not only as a super hero, but as a Hollywood movie that deserves to be seen more than once.", "I went into the theater expecting a well made film by the Russos (given their credibility shown by Winter Soldier and Civil War), at the same time not expecting too much, as the film would be full of characters and I thought it wouldn't be able balance two things, 1) serve justice to each character (particularly Thanos, as comic book readers like me (To name some, Infinity Gauntlet, Infinity, Thanos (2017) and many more comics very well know the mad titan, but most of the mainstream audience doesn't.) and 2) adhere to the plot at the same time. And oh, I thought unlike the previous MCU flicks, this would be weighed down by the seriousness of the plot to allow any humor. Boy, was I wrong.  SPOILER FREE REVIEW FOR THE FIRST PART. This movie is a total masterpiece. Balancing humor at the right moments and the seriousness near perfectly (If this is a spoiler : Just like how Thanos would like it, balance), and providing enough background story to the character of the Mad Titan, this is, in some ways, truly a Thanos movie. You can actually sympathize with the character in a few moments. The movie totally lives up to the hype. All credit to the Russos and the wonderful cast. A truly intimidating villain, you'll actually forget that the MCU had some terrible villians. The quest for the Infinity Stones isn't just total destruction for Thanos, it carries more meaning to him. Our heroes face a threat they have never even imagined, and the tie-in after Civil War is wonderfully portrayed. Each character has an arc that is perfectly balanced along with the plot. You are probably wondering what they'll do against an OP villian. So go watch the movie. The movie ends on a cliffhanger that'll make you want to stay in your seats until Avengers 4 comes out, or make you wish you had Doc Strange's time stone with you, so you could turn time. And oh, there's a post credits scene, that subtly ties into what's coming next and A4. PART TWO : CONTAINS SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK. STRICTLY FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE WATCHED THE MOVIE. IF YOU HAVEN'T, AND YOU COME ACROSS THE FOLLOWING SPOILERS, IT WILL BE YOUR OWN FAULT THAT THE MOVIE WAS RUINED. SO PLEASE, GO WATCH THE MOVIE. #THANOSDEMANDSOURSILENCEFORTHOSEWHOHAVEN'TSEENTHEMOVIE\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nBEWARE, YOU WERE WARNED.  Banner is truly terrified by Thanos, as you can see in many parts of the movie, due to their encounter in the very first phase in the movie, where Thanos totally dominates the Hulk which laters clearly shows itself as the Hulk's fear of Thanos and the Hulk not taking over. Loki deserved the completion of his character arc, by meeting his death at the hands of Thanos, paying for his betrayal and failure, though Loki's last moments were akin to a hero, i.e, trying to protect Thor. Also loved the throwback to The Avengers, when Loki tells Thanos, that \"we have a hulk\". Tony Stark's destiny arrived in a true sense : His fear wasn't himself dying, but seeing his fellow teammates and friends dead (Just like it was shown in Age of Ultron) which happens at the end of the movie. Cap is no longer Cap, only Steve Rogers living his life sort of like a nomad in the past 2 years since the Civil War. Gamora's death was unexpected, but you can clearly see a different side to Thanos when he truly loves his daughter, but has to sacrifice her anyway, for bringing balance to the universe, and fulfilling his destiny by obtaining the Soul Stone. Bummer that Hawkeye and Ant-Man aren't in the movie, but I'm sure they'll prove important in Avengers 4. There's also a clever reveal, that of Red Skull being the guardian of the Soul Stone, after his sudden absence due to the tesseract in the First Avenger. The Wakanda and Titan acts are wonderfully portrayed, with each serving a proper impact to the future of the Avengers. Peter Quill's moment was the deciding one, as if they had gotten the Gauntlet, Thanos wouldn't have defeated all of them. The Wakanda fight scenes are so GOOD, they're Civil War's Airport scene x 10. Now, I'll cut to the points I want to make : comic fans will be slightly disappointed to know there's no Lady Death, or Thanos's mad infatuation with her. Instead this version of Thanos is driven by the need for balance in the universe, given the universe's limited resources. In a way, it does seem okay. There's also the dreaded snap, as in the comics, with Thanos wiping away half the universe. The Guardians fade away, and so do many others, Bucky, Falcon, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Nick Fury, Maria Hill, etc etc. Spider-Man's death was very emotional, as you can see Stark's worst fears coming true, with Peter saying \"Mr.Stark, I don't want to die\", and fading away. The post credits scene shows Fury sending a distress signal to *wait for it* .. Captain Marvel! And with Fury and Hill slowly fading away too. The future of the MCU has never been as uncertain as it is now. One thing's for sure - Avengers 4 will equally blow our minds out. And as for waiting for it, I wish I had the time stone. Then I would fast forward to the future just like Strange did with 14,000,205 futures.", "Not many movies has lived up to my expectations, but this one even surpassed. Go and see the movie. NOW", "Oh boy what can I say about this movie...well facts that I loved:\n1. Thanos..yes he is the villain I did not know I wanted to see..for a long time I was reluctant of how Marvel studios would introduce this guy..I mean until infinity wars Thanos didn't look as very promising villain more like the purple muscle-dude on the chair.. but the deepness of his character, his personality I didn't see that coming..The mad Titan was worth the waiting..his philosophy, his relationship with his daughter and the snap of his fingers..GOD where do you go after all these?\n2.So many encounters..I mean if you are a nerd as am I you never really get enough of these.. seeing all these super heroes team up was giving me a nerdorgasm after another..\n3.Closure..Many of our favorite superheroes faced some of their deepest emotions (and then most of them died)..If you were curious to find out how Lokie feels about his brother?How Gamora feels about Thanos?or Quill?This is your type of movie..\n4. The long game..Now this is a huge spoiler but the key character for all that happens in the movie is by far Dr Strange.. Just pay attention to the dude..this might save you some tears...no need to say more..just watch the movie\n5. The Hulk-Banner relationship.. This might sound silly but I feel that there is some deeper explanation to Hulk's behavior that really intrigues me to find out. If that is not the case it still is hilarious as hell.. Overall, this was the best Marvel movie!!", "Well, this seems as if it was the first Avengers movie where Tony Stark didn't hog the centre of attention. In fact it seems to be pretty evenly spaced between all of the Marvel characters, and with the number that have now come into the franchise, I was wondering how they were going to handle the huge ensemble. Well, it turned out pretty well, though of course when you have so many super heroes all gathered together the bad guy is going to have to be pretty tough, and they outline they quite quickly where he takes down the Hulk.\n This is probably one of those movies that we don't need to say anything about the plot because it has been building up to it for the last ten years, and anyway it is actually based on a comic book series as it is. So, we have this Titan, Thanos (Titan as in an inhabitant of Titan as opposed to one of the old gods from Greek mythology, though Marvel hasn't shied away from borrowing from mythology as it is). He has this plan to depopulate the universe and to do that he needs these stones called Infinity Stones, and when he has all of them he will become invincible. Once again, the movies over the last ten years have been dropping hints as to these stones, and now we have basically come to the climax of that story arc.\n So, the question that is raised, is where to from here. Well, I'm sure the avid comic book readers do have a pretty good idea since there is quite a lot of material that can be borrowed from. However, we also need to remember that this is actually part one of a two part series, so the story isn't over yet. The problem is that with the ending as it is, there isn't all that much room to be able place any movies between the two Avengers movie. However, it seems that we will be seeing Captain Marvel and Ant Man and the Wasp before the grand finale to this Avengers movie.\n Okay, this may be a bit of a spoiler, but then again I have warned you, but characters do die, which is a bit of an oddity because if there is one thing with comic books and that is characters always seem to be able to come back. Well, that seems to be the case with the movies as well because Loki seems have have had some miraculous resurrections. However, I will leave it at that.\n Now Thanos, they certainly have put a lot of effort into creating a villain that works. There are a lot of shallow villains out there, and Thanos certainly isn't one of them. Sure, he has a motive, but it isn't one of those 'I want to conquer the universe' type of motives. In a way he seems to just want a bit of peace and quiet, and the problem is that overpopulation certainly doesn't allow room for that. Sure, he is pretty powerful, and when you are going up against pretty much every single Marvel hero that has appeared to date (with the exception of Ant-Man - he is mysteriously absent in the film), you certainly are going to have to be of a special calibre.\n As for the comedy, well, they certainly have toned it down a lot. It was starting to get to the point where the movies were simply turning into a collection of one liners, particularly with Thor: Ragnarok. However, this wasn't the case here, which did help quite a lot. I do hope they continue along that trend and continue to tone down with it. However, it was a shame that some of the really cool characters from Ragnarok went missing in action as well, but I think the opening scene pretty much explains that.", "While I previously wrote a review, I wanted to redo it. Because this film is Awesome. One of the best superhero films ever made, this film took our expectations and completely turned them upside down, by \"killing off\" the characters we least expected to go. Featuring fantastic direction from the Russo Brothers that balances each character perfectly giving the audience just the right amount of time with each hero. Josh Brolin delivers one of his best performances, and quite possibly the best performance in the film, giving Thanos true motivation that makes him a true villain you love to hate. (just as much as Heath Ledger's Joker) The performances from our heroes are also fantastic and it's hard to single out a select few as they all do a fantastic job. I love this film just as much as the first and I'm truly stunned to see where they're going with the franchise from here on out. Cause as fans we're in the Endgame now.", "I've heard and read comments that the humor in the movie wasn't entirely appropriate given the dark nature of the premise. This is Marvel. Marmite - you love the humor or you don't. I do. I'd rate this a solid 9 out of 10. It was definitely the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the MCU - or at least that's how it felt. The Russos did a great job of bringing the tone and style of each of the franchises together. Standouts were Thanos and Gamora. We know Spidey, Black Panther will be back as their solo sequels have been announced. Gamora's fate only realy pays off is if she stays 'dead'. I worry that she won't. I love Zoe Saldana and Gamora, but narratively her loss would feel empty if she was resurrected or brought back via time-travel or something like that. Losing Hemidall was emotional as well - but Idris Elba is too big for a cameo part in the MCU. Loki needs to stay dead as well. Tom Hiddleston, for me, is still the standout villain in the MCU, but his death is a catalyst for Thor's story in the movie. With so many characters 'dissolving', it did feel like it devalued some of the other deaths - Gamora, Loki, Heimdall. This is the reason i can't give it a 10 out of 10. With so many characters to give dialogue and screen time to, fans of specific characters will feel disappointed their favorite didn't get more - especially Black Widow. But great fight between her, Okoye and Proxima Midnight. Thor was an unexpected highlight - the emotional narrative - and great to see the introduction of Stormbreaker. Overall, a fitting way to bring together 10 years of the universe. Was even good to see General Ross and Red Skull. One final thought - great post-credits scene and would love to see the post-credits scene in Captain Marvel, where Brie Larson's Cap receives the encoded distress message from Fury, and she unloads a whole bunch of whoop-ass on Thanos.", "Infinity War Exceeded all my expectations from beginning to end and blew me away. It was severely emotional and tearjerker in some places and in others it was lots of fun, action packed and very funny. All the characters from the MCU got their chance to shine here and Josh Brolin as Thanos is by far the greatest villain we've had yet in the MCU! He really raised up the stakes and made the whole movie feel like nobody was safe which is something we haven't actually had before. The Movie Does End to where you really don't know what just happened and what will happen next as half of our heroes disappear into thin air and we don't know if they're alive or dead, Thanos goes off to another planet and is left thinking about his victory and what his next move will be and captain marvel is on her way to assist the others after Nick fury contacts her through a pager. My final thoughts are that this is a absolutely mind Blowing movie from beginning to end with lots of twists and turns, really emotional moments and action packed scenes that look magnificent! In my opinion this easily the best superhero movie of all time and the greatest movie In the marvel cinematic universe to date and will most likely be supremely surpassed by part 2. Cannot wait till next year and if you haven't seen the movie yet get to the theatre now!", "This movie is out of the world what a awesome movie and story i don't have words for this movies plz go and watch the movie in 3D and heads off and thanks to Marvel and all actors and specially director Russo brothers to do that magic...... thanks", "Avengers Infinity War lives up to the hype in all possible ways. From beginning to end, I didn't know whether to cheer or cry.", "Once again Marvel has made another amazing movie never a boring moment amazing to see all the super heroes come together can't wait for part two", "SPOILER FREE!!!! DO NOT LET ANYONE SPOIL THIS MOVIE FOR YOU!!!!! So it's officially been 10 years since the MCU has begun (he takes a short break to let out a little cry as he realizes how effing old he is) and more or less I've really enjoyed the films. There have been a couple I wasn't a fan of, and honestly there were only a few I absolutely loved, but this one. THIS ONE! This is Marvels answer to Nolan.  First off, I was amazed at how well the directors and writers balanced the tone and characters. No characters are shoved to the side, they all have ample screen time and serve their purpose. And every time a new character shows up it legitimately feels like their movies tone. When youre with Dr. Strange it feels like his movie, when you're with the Guardians it feels like their movie and so on and so forth. It astounds and impresses the hell out of me that the Russo Brothers were able to pull this off so seamlessly and have it not feel jumbled or clunky, especially seeing as there are so many characters to juggle.  But yeah, let's talk about the big guy. Thanos. \nNow I think it's safe to say the weakest part of the MCU has been their villains, again with a couple exceptions i.e. Loki and Killmonger, but Thanos is easily the best of the entire series and one of the best villains I've ever seen in a movie. Why??? Because he's actually a character!!!!! He's not just some mindless thug looking to destroy the universe because bad guy plot, he's a real, fleshed out character with a tragic background and emotions. There are times when he doesn't want to do the things he's doing but feels he needs to because what he's doing is the best thing for the universe, and while he's clearly insane and evil, you see through his eyes so much it's hard not to empathize with the guy.  This movie is big. It's grand. It's epic on a Lord of the Rings scale. It's funny when it needs to be and it's serious when it needs to be. It perfectly balances all these likable and well developed characters perfectly and has one of the greatest villains in cinema history. There's no other word for it: Avengers - Infinity War is a damn masterpiece that might just dismantle The Dark Knight as my favorite comic book movie. Without a doubt this movie gets a perfect 10/10.", "A remarkable movie for ending first 10 years of MCU. Things i love the most about this movie are the villain and the ending. Thanos is truly the best villain in MCU. His emotions, his ideal, everything about him had shown in this movie made me and so many fans love him, even thought he was right. And the ending, it make me speechless for 2 days to think about it. It actually is the ending that most of the fans has wished for. The ending makes me on the emotionals roller coaster. Infinity war is absolutely awsome.\nNote: To enjoy this movie, you should watch some MCU's movies first to know some characters and to understand them", "I just saw the new Avengers Infinity War movie in theatre and I have to say it's just amazing. I love how Marvel managed to fit all these characters in the movie. Also I wanted to mention that there were a bunch of surprises about the soul stone and what happens at the end of the movie. It's quite worth waiting for the after-credit scene to see what the story of the Avengers 4 movie might become. The film is totally worth a look!", "Infinity war had a lot of expectations to live up to. When those expectations contain some characters being written off, they should abide that (pretty sure all the dead ones are gonna be back for the next part). Marvel's epic outing could have been better, if provided with some more drama and plot rather than jokes. The previous Marvel movies had that to its advantage, the jokes and comedic reliefs weren't forced. In IW, it just feels out of place.  Russo brothers might have created a perfect mix and a lesson on how to bring a vast amount of characters into a 2 and half hour movie. Infinity war isn't Marvel's best, but it surely grabs a spot at the top. If IW gonna be praised, praise it. But only for Thanos. Marvel had their long term villain problem fixed with Black Panther. They just took it a step further with Thanos. Thanos might not be the villain that can encompass moral values. He isn't Killmonger. He isn't Vulture. Each had a physical weakness rather than a emotional one.  Although Thanos's reason for erasing half the universe is pretty dumb, the way in which the reason is reached out to the audience is where IW succeeds. IW feels like something just took out what the film should've stood for. For Marvel fans who said that there's gonna be so much weeping in the theaters, i can assure you there was none. If any, they laughed. Marvel yet again delivered one of the most cheesiest one-liners throughout. Although it didn't spoil the seriousness of the movie (try telling that to a DC fan), Marvel should really work on the jokes thing. If marvel wanted to do a comedy movie, bring in Waititi to direct. Apart from a pretty straightforward plot and storyline, IW suffers from too much jokes and one-liners. All these drawbacks might be stomped down by a jaw - dropping ending (provided they stick with it). Marvel, you did it again. IW isn't the superhero film of the decade, nor is gonna be any competition to the present classics. It is EPIC, DARING and pretty AMBITIOUS. Nothing more, nothing less.", "Wow.... Just wow.  Avengers Infinity War: 10 years in the making, this is what the whole of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building to and boy is it a shocking, enjoyable surprise.  Directed by the Russo Brothers and starring... everyone, Infinity War finally has Thanos collecting the infinity stones, the most powerful items in the universe, together and all our heroes are in a desperate race to stop him.  There's so much that goes on in this movie it's almost impossible to go into detail without spoilers, right from the get go you know that Infinity War has stakes and hopeless stakes at that. They are pulling no punches and surprised me on multiple occasions with their choices. This is the darkest and edgy-est movie Marvel have made but they still kept their light heartedness for the most part, they turned that happy-go-lucky attitude off when it needed and man did it shock you.  Now, this is a big movie huge in fact. But they somehow managed to keep it very contained. Yes there's the big massive group fight, but for majority of the action and story telling its smaller groups interacting with each other. And that's one of the films highlights, there is not a huge team up of every single hero. Instead there's around 3 groups of smaller teams (with 3 different plot lines) and this allows us to see heros we wouldn't otherwise see work and fight together to great effect. And Infinity War does a great job balancing our hero stories with Thanos', yes Thanos has a story and an arc. Speaking of which.  Thanos. Big purple headed CGI Ron Perlman Thanos.... \nHe works. \nEverything that has been said about Thanos is completely thrown of the table in the first 5 minutes of Infinity War. He is incredibly intimidating and utterly compelling, whether speaking or letting his actions for him. But not only that you almost find yourself sympathising with him and understanding his motives and choices in the movie. You kinda get his thought process. This makes him a fantastic villain. I thought I'd never see a good CGI villian but Thanos definitely proves me wrong.  And I've unlike other marvel movies, I have no idea where they are going to take this. And that is Infinity Wars greatest triumph. Unpredictably. At no point did you know for definite what was going to happen. And you felt that in the cinema. There's of course an after credit scene. Normally around half the audience leave before this comes around, here no one moved an inch.  The only things going against Infinity War is the start can be a tad clunky. Because over the 10 years of Marvel so many different film makers and writers have worked on these characters pulling all that together at times didn't fit correctly. \nAlso the very fact that there's 10 years of pervious movies (18 not including Infinity War), am not sure if casual viewers will get the same impact as those who've seen every single one. Am sure they'll be able to understand the gist of Infinity War but they may have a few questions.  This movie is a blast and came as a complete surprise, which I have no idea where they're going to next. I give Avengers Infinity War an A.  And it was pretty damn cool seeing Edinburgh get punched like that.", "Specially, I'm a big fan of Marvel. This time they rock it again with \"Avengers: Infinity War\". All the spectaculars action scenes and emotions will gives you goosebumps. \nI never seen this kind of Action Villain in any movies yet. THANOS like a Anti-Villain, He done fabulous job with his perfections. Much awaited for Avengers 4.", "This was the best Marvel Movie ever made. The writing was incredible, the plot was up to the mark. All characters did a good job, Doctor Strange was amazing with his jokes and Iron Man was really good, In my country most of the tickets were sold on the first booking day itself. India Loves You. Joe and Anthony you people killed it, My Top favourite heroes were : Spider-Man, Iron Man and Black Panther, I actually love all of em but these 3 are my favourite. Thanos was an amazing villain, the character was really good, I thing he's the best villain. I just can't wait for the Part 2 Like everyone asks \"Where's Hawkeye\" where is he Joe. Hats off to you guys. Love From India", "I watched it yesterday in my cinema and it blows my Mind I love this film!", "This is one of the most entertaining super hero movie i have ever seen for a long time. Mavel exceeded my expectation. At the same time I am feeling very disappointed of DC, because they are not able to provide this kind of movies.", "The Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy, Thanos.  On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality.  The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.... After ten years of big budget, even bigger box office movies, here's lies the first key to the conclusion of all three phases, and was it worth the wait?\nYes, and then some. This is the movie that holds the key to ten years of dedication and respect to some of the most beloved comic book characters ever created, and even though it boasts an absolute plethora of characters, they are all included, even though Stark, Rogers, and Thor predictably get the lions share of the screentime. The film is almost split into three, we have different arcs. One featuring Stark, Parker, and Strange. One featuring Thor and The Gaurdians. And the other featuring the rest of the Avengers preparing for Thanos. As for the audience, we could have never been prepared for Thanos, easily the most humanistic MCU villain since Killmonger, and his goal is simple, collect all six stones in order to create a more tranquil and peaceful universe. Is he really the epitome of all evil, after all, his purpose is sound to him, even if it is genocidal, and this makes him such a difficult and complex villain. There are times when he has to make difficult decisions, there are times when it seems that he may be able to be reasoned with. But this is their infinite adversary, and it really has been worth the wait, it really has been worth sitting through a few clunkers, because this semi conclusion goes way beyond what you have been building up for, and to say that the Russo Brothers have gone dark for this, is an understatement. It still has that wonderful sense of humour that has been rife throughout the films, and the chemistry between all characters is seamless, but the final third will have your mouth left gaping, especially if you have invested so much time with this universe. As expected, the effects are amazing, and even if Thanos looks like Bruce Willis, you soon forget he is a walking creation of the computer. But with the ending, it's either one of the biggest red herrings committed to celluloid, or the Disney/Marvel monster are aware of superhero fatigue, and are not scared of sacrificing a few franchises. Believe the hype, and then some, this is the movie event of the decade, and it has the best ensemble cast since The Longest Day. Next year cannot come quick enough.....", "The Avengers super-mash-up has out-done itself once again: more heroes, fiercer baddies, grander scope, and greater peril. It's almost too much and yet not enough in other ways, because the screen time for many characters get spread so thin. Assuming you have seen most of the MCU movies up to this point, you'll appreciate that a handful of the characters previously under-developed have gotten more attention, but many of the favorites who were previously better-developed got barely enough time to be a cue for a crowd cheer. For some of them, it felt like the actors/actresses couldn't even get into character or understand the context of the scene -- one may posit that the secrecy over the whole plot had a negative impact on their performances. While the heroes may have come from the pages of comic books, their foes seemed to have come from grotesque video games. The setup is familiar: the big-bad has a handful of one-dimensional lieutenants and a horde of violent minions/beasts/robots/whatnot. However, I would say that Thanos was the star of the show, in a way we haven't seen nor talked about since the first Avengers (the enigmatic Loki). Not only is Thanos powerful, but this Mad Titan has some depth, development, and determination that's typically reserved the good guys. This is an epic that I will surely like to watch again soon, because so much just whizzed by in a blur the first time, and there was more than one reason for that! This was my first visit to a new-ish 3D venue that might need to have some kinks worked out, because I felt the visuals were really muddy and dizzying during many fast action sequences -- more than the usual 3D blur. Maybe it was a technical issue with this particular showing, but personally I would recommend going to a non-3D showing.", "There's almost no way of reviewing this movie without containing spoilers. Infinity War was everything the fans asked for, and sometimes even more. So many surprising elements and REALLY emotional scenes. The movie begins brutally by killing off Loki in just seconds. It tells you right away what kind of film this will be, and boy does it get darker throughout the way. Yes, there were MANY jokes and while some didn't land, at least Marvel finally managed to even out the jokes with the serious and emotional scenes (unlike Thor ragnarok and GOTG vol. 2). This time there wasn't some silly cringe reference or dance off when stuff was going down. Although the movie did feel a little choppy towards the first quarter, it immediately crafted itself together beautifully halfway throughout the final act. It just kept getting better and better, while getting more intense too. Whenever Thanos popped up all your attention was drawn to him. It was like Darth Vader, everyone in the room (not just in the film) acknowledged his presence and feared him. Josh Brolin by far stole the show as Thanos. His facial expressions and menace actually for once made up for a real threatening villain. Just when you thought stuff couldn't get any worse, it did. And it just kept going on and on until the whole audience got teary. Watching Thanos fight Tony gave me goosebumps, as I expected this to be the end of Tony. Everyone slowly fading away did make you lose hope. By far the most emotional scene for me was when Peter was crying on Tony while he knew what was about to happen. This movie didn't hold back at all. It was just menacing and everything hit you in the face so quickly. All the avengers showed got their moments of epicness, ESPECIALLY Thor. The end does leave many questions on everyone's minds as well as theories. But that's what makes it so good. My biggest fear with this film (apart from the potential cringe comedy) would be feeling done after IW. But nope, this just makes me want see Avengers 4 like right now. I want to see what happens next.  This film truly felt like an epic, and its grand scale of setting and characters really supported that fact. All the avengers were turned up more than ever as they realized this was quite possible the end of all things. Directing such a massive film with so many things going on at once is not an easy task. That's why I bumped this movie from an 8 to a 9, because I respect all the effort put into it plus the fact that it felt coherent most of the time. Not to mention the emotional scenes were powerful as well. This movie was jaw dropping and Marvel just reminded everyone why the Avengers are the BEST superhero group in any set of superhero films. We know these characters, we know their desires, and we've known them for 10 years. Now we are witnessing the end product. Avengers 4, come quick!", "What a great movie. 10/10\nPerfect ending, funny throughout the entire movie. No boring parts, not one.", "In my opinion this movie was what all Marvel fans wanted.Great action scenes,maybe the best villian,great story arc and great ending.\nI think that if someone likes marvel will love this movie like i did.", "Does Marvel deliver on Hype ? Yes\nDoes Marvel do Justice to all Characters ? Yes\nIs Thanos able to match awesomeness of Avengers ? Yes\nIs there epic fanboy movements ? Yes\nDoes the movie deliver the hype ? Yes\nHail Marvel", "This is for me the best film from far away from Marvel Studios, it is everyone who has the best villain, although I really liked erick killmonger, Thanos is undoubtedly the best.\nThe action scenes of this film are very good, but this is something that Marvel has already shown us, but something that makes this film so special is its courage in relation to other films from the same studio, the interaction of characters is also anything and more I do not say I only have to say that who has not seen the film should go see as soon as possible.", "I finally feel as though they have taken a leap. This movie was really well executed, beautiful CGI, and very good writing. The plot flowed surprisingly well considering everything that had to fit in this movie. I felt as though the humor was very well balanced. The action was choreographed soo well. Overall, well done Marvel. As a fan since the very beginning of the MCU, I was very impressed. I left the theater with that \"Holy crap, I need to see that again, and again, and again\" feeling.", "Im literally shaking right now!!! This movie is just PERFECT!!! Go and watch it for yourself...im damn sure you won't be disappointed.", "Marvel's Infinity War soars as it gives us what the franchise has promised ever since 2012's The Avengers. Out of all of this film's ambitions, the most impressive feat remains to be on delivering a Thanos that is menacing, intriguing, and astoundingly tragic. This leads to a film that is epic at its core, yet emotional and patient in its execution.  The standout of this film is arguably its main character, Thanos. It is through him that we see a villain that does not boast about how evil he is for the sake of being evil. He does not twirl his moustache and no longer sits idly on his chair basking at how destiny is at the palm of his hands. His pursuit and end goal in the film is portrayed as something noble. It is one that requires consequential sacrifices to be made and he believes that what he is doing is faultless and the right thing. He understands pain and loss and we see that throughout the film. He laments the countless lives he has lost and especially the things that he genuinely cares about. He believes that it is his burden to carry out his task of collecting the Infinity Stones and that he is the only one willing enough to save the Universe through his own means. He is the ultimate antithesis to the Avengers. It also surely helps that Josh Brolin's portrayal of him, even though mostly CGI, is one that shows an abundance of depth and a commanding presence to the character. Meanwhile, it is made clear here that the Avengers exhibit themselves as those who happen to believe that even one life sacrificed is not a cost that they are willing to take. It is through them that Thanos reveals their goals as futile and short-sighted. This theme is hammered home even more by showing how \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" are still hopelessly divided through numerous planets and locations. Fresh from the events of Civil War, Tony and Steve are still not on speaking terms and the threat of galactic destruction could not have come in a more terrible time.  That doesn't mean that there aren't plenty of character dynamics that are absolutely brilliant. To name a few, Cumberbatch and Downey give phenomenal and unwavering performances that mostly pay-off the peril and torture that they've been expecting to arrive for years now through the destruction of life itself. Holland also gives a vulnerable and obviously young side to him even at the midst of the end of the world. Hemsworth shows off his acquired personality from Ragnarok, yet still shaken and jagged because of what's at stake. He shines as his role as the God of Thunder has never seen this much significance compared to prior outings. His interaction with the Guardians is the perfect bridging of both worlds that we knew was already coming sooner or later. Rocket and Groot are also given an unexpected role along with Thor that was fun and unique to watch. Speaking of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Gamora and Quill standout as their worried and broken past comes back to haunt them. Gamora particularly shines as the daughter of Thanos, which gives a sense of history and affliction for both characters. Each character drives home the grim and merciless danger that they are in. The stakes are still high and it is made clear for each sequence. Nonetheless, this is all not to say that this movie lost the usual Marvel trademarks of quips and lighthearted fun. It's still definitely an Avengers movie and how the characters organically and hilariously complement each other just makes their eventual collapse and downfall even more tragic and heartbreaking. On a technical standpoint, the film is visually breathtaking and ups the scale to planets and worlds previously unimaginable. The blending of both the Guardians, the Avengers and Thanos himself breathes an entire universe into life and it feels lived in and familiar. The action scenes are definitely on point and take center stage in this film. The Russo brothers have learned a lot ever since they took the directing helm in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The film presents the action as it is and does not opt in for shaky cams or obviously recognizable body doubles. They do not disappoint, aside from set pieces being a little too short lived as the film has to constantly go back to other side stories happening planets away. It's understandable as it has to juggle this huge ensemble of a cast that already had their own character developments and movies prior to this one. However, when a Lord of the Rings-esque battle is ensuing, it doesn't help when the film steps back from it to show a side story which we inevitably all know where it will lead it up to. Aside from that, other minor complaints are how the film's score shy away from using the individual themes to symbolize the heroic moments of their respective heroes. The Guardians of the Galaxy theme or the Spider-Man Homecoming theme are a few examples that are not present in the movie.  In the end, this film will leave you speechless, disturbed, and perturbed. It's something that Marvel has successfully made us feel after 10 years with most of these characters. It's a unique cinematic experience that any other franchise or movie comes close to nowadays. Infinity War essentially created a cultural phenomenon that will be discussed further in years to come. Verdict: 4.5/5", "I always enjoy a surprise at the cinema, I just didn't expect to be surprised in the way that I was. I've invested a lot of time in the MCU, and just when I think I'm tiring of superhero films, Marvel step their game up again. They did it with Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, Spiderman Homecoming, Ant Man, Dr Strange... these were all films that I wasn't so much as excited, more nervous that they might finally start underwhelming after 10 years of very serviceable and more often than not extremely good film-making. I, however, expected Infinity War to deliver. And it did. The gravity of this film just felt so much bigger. All the traditional \"they'll have a couple of punch ups, but nothing will really happen\" worries faded completely in the opening sequence. This was a film that meant business. The action scenes were great - especially the battle in Wakanda. It was LOTRs -esque. Quips aplenty, and some very good acting (Holland especially) made this film extremely watchable, and the CGI was magnificent. Where the storyline strains a tad, the screen still pops and the characters really feed off each other. I, like many others in the build up, was worried about the law of diminishing returns with so many characters on screen. However, the Russo brothers took a step back and approached it logically - don't have them all in the same place. It worked very well, and whilst certain characters really did cry out for more screen time, there were no real complaints. Why? Because this film, whilst an Avengers film, is really all about... Thanos. My god. How wrong I was. I was so against yet another wooden CGI villain, but Brolin and the CGI team have nailed one of the most memorable super-villains in... well, all time. There are problems with the consistency of his powers and how he uses them, but he really dominates both the screen and the movie as a whole. Thanos manages to actually be fearsome, where so many other Marvel villains have failed. He's got a cliched backstory, yet you can still empathise with him. I never expected Thanos to have so much depth. Thanos is the real triumph of this film, which is the biggest surprise by a longshot. For me, he's as ground-breaking as the first time we saw Serkis' Gollum on the big screen. Infinity War certainly sits in the upper echelons of the MCU to date. With the new raised stakes, I find myself refreshed and reinvested in the franchise, and desperately awaiting news on how both Ant-Man and Captain Marvel come into this story. Because, at the moment, you truly believe in Thanos' power, and the futility of the Avengers' plight.", "Alright so I'm going to try my best to keep this as a NON-SPOILER REVIEW, as there are many shocking plot twists and surprises and I wouldn't want to ruin that experience for you. Wow! What a ride! This film was everything I wanted it to be! Exciting, thrilling, and beautifully crafted over the course of 10 years and 19 films. Yes, I have waited for this ever since the inception of the MCU back in 2008, but more importantly as someone who read Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet series 17 years ago. It was breathtaking and jaw dropping to see something of this scope come to life on the big screen from the very same comics I read as a child. @therussobrothers did an amazing job balancing the tone of all the characters (comedic and serious tones) and giving every character their spotlight without making it feel too overcrowded or bloated. The action itself in some of the scenes were taken directly from the pages of Hickman's 'Infinity' run couple of years ago which made me really happy to see. Although there were a lot of surprises in the film, the one element that surprised me the most was the amount of emotional weight that the film carried, it really helped develop certain character arcs especially Thanos, and man oh man when Thanos comes on screen, he really steals it! Not only is he frightening and intimidating, but he has a very grounded and philosophical twist to his character that makes you sympathize for him and his surprisingly emotional motivations. Action was great and easy to follow with no shaky cams this time (yaaaaay!), but the overall story and execution was better than Civil War and Winter Soldier (which everyone knows I love to death). In the end this was everything I hoped and wanted to see in an Infinity War film and I really can't wait for Avengers 4 next year! Whatever you do, see this film before someone spoils it for you as there are many idiots going and spoiling it for others who haven't had the time to see it on opening day! Make sure you experience it in IMAX if you have one next to you, the screen is much bigger and visuals look more vibrant and sharp! Oh and there is one post credit scene so stick around after the credits for a treat!", "I sat down to watch it on 26/04/18, and boy, was I expecting a blowout! I was expecting a normal Hero vs Villain film. I was wrong. The plot was well set out, and well thought out, I was amazed with Marvel's work. For you to understand the start, I would advise watching Thor: Ragnarok and Doctor Strange before watching this film. I mean, the MCU news had said that Stan Lee had given the directors, writers and performers to kill off whoever they wish, and they didn't abuse this power at all! Another MCU fact had stated that Tom Holland was to perform alone, in front of a green screen and to say his lines, and there was a lot of 'nods' to the fans about that. In the original comics, it was the X-Men fighting alongside the Avengers. Now bare in mind that Marvel have just brought X-Men back, there is a slight chance that they might appear in the film. Thanos is our bad guy here, and trust me Josh Brolin had made Thanos just like his comic self. Thanos has to be just like the comic book self. Now the list of characters:\n So DC better get ready for Avengers 4, because it's gonna be a banger.", "This is everything I hoped for.\nI have waited for infinity war for so long and I didn't try for once to lower my expectations because I simply couldn't, i went to the movie with high expectations and boy it DELIVERED.\nI cried three separate times in those two and a half hour period.\nThe movie was intense, the crowd was intense and everything was intense. Most people were setting on edge and are so locked with the story and the characters.\nYou don't feel overwhelmed by the huge amount of characters and storylines and i think the editing -which was so so so beautiful done- had a huge impact on that \nNow I'm not going to spoil anything but i have to say Tom holland's performance in one particular scene was so beautiful and heartbreaking and the acting was overwhelmingly good. He never fails to amaze me.\nGoing to this film I heard people say how heartbreaking , sad and dark it is and I thought i was ready for it but I wasn't and I don't think you will.\nI hate this film in the most loving way possible.", "It was an amazing movie in 2018 till now. All cgaracters did good work. My favorite was Thor, Iron man, Thanos. This characters did a amazing work Thanos was killed it in villain role.", "10 years in making....and a grand finale. A flood of emotions hits u as the characters reveal their distinct persona.....The ego clash between doc and stark.....The newly recruited Spidey who doesn't wanna disappoint..... Hulk with his 'issues'....Star lord's jealousy towards Thor.....The love between Wanda and vision....And most importantly the heart within the Titan.... Everything makes your butt stick to the seat even when the movie gets over.....You might need some tissues for the climax.\nThe grandeur of the fight sequence and the way it is filmed just blows our brains out....A solid villain with a solid intentions who almost convinces us that he is doing the right thing. The visuals are extraordinary and flawless making it a visual treat....\nA part of the final portion is a bit 'surreal' but overall a celebration with a mixture of emotions delivered on correct propotions for this summer.", "You know that feeling when you're bursting for the toilet, I mean you have the sweats you're back teeth are floating, you can feel it touching the cloth but your miles from any decent place to go so you hold it and hold it. But then you get home, race to that porcelain prize.  It sits there like a gift from the gods looking all shiny and white, clean and pristine then you proceed to bomb it like a middle eastern country. You remember that feeling of relief, joy, rapture you might have even commented to yourself it doesn't get any better than this, well that might be true until you see Infinity War, it's that good  Now where's the toilet roll????", "After 10 years of Marvel it's finally here, Avengers: Infinity War. The movie is about Thanos trying to find all of the Infinity Stones so he can kill half of the galaxy. I don't want to give a oplot of things away so that's all you need to know. First off what the Russo brothers did here is unremarkable, they give each and every character enough screen time and I don't know how they did it but it's incredible. Josh Brolin as Thanos steals every scene he is in, how they wrote his character is just perfect. You can see they learned a lot from Killmonger and Zemo on how to write great villians. The whole cast does phenominal, a big shoutout to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark because yet agian he delivers a perfect preformance. Tom Holland as Spiderman is unbelieveble in this movie, so is Chris Evans, Zoe saldana, Chris Hemsworth, everybody brings their A game. The fear I had going into this movie was that because there are so many characters that the tone would be just jumbled and messy, but the Russo brothers and the writers did such a fantastic job when there is a really dark scene, the next scene they give you a funny comment that's just perfect to switch the tone of the movie. Then they give you something funnier everytime so they build up to it, then when they want to make it really dark agian they give you something to switch the tones agian and it works perfectlly. Avengers: Infinity war has the best directing in the whole series, and is a lot of fun but also very dark. I highly recommend this movie and I can't wait for the second part. What a fantastic movie!", "This is the best Marvel movie so far! It's like going to the theater and see the best episode of your favorite tv series, because you know.. it's all been leading to this! The directors were able to fit every character's story in without making it seem forced. Humor is on point and CGI is absolutely amazing! I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was absolutely worth it, I can tell it was one of the best 3D movies since Avatar and I felt like I was completely immersed in the story, both mentally and physically. It has everything you need to see but nothing you would expect, it's a pure experience that will certainly blow your mind, from the beginning to the very end. The countdown for Avengers 4 has begun..", "This is one of the most anticipated movies of the year for many people. The hype surrounding this movie after ten years of buildup in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is something many fans have been looking forward to for a long time. I have to admit, I too was greatly looking forward to this movie. After having seen it on a packed Thursday night IMAX showing, I am more than satisfied.  Possibly this movie's greatest accomplishment is how successfully it manages to balance its massive cast. Most everyone in this movie gets a noteworthy role or a shining moment in the film. Most of the characters got what I found to be a reasonable amount of screentime. To me this is an immense feat, one which I remain impressed by. I found the choices of which characters got to interact together through their storylines to be quite smart, making for a very entertaining and funny movie to watch.  This movie successfully manages to retain that wonderful Marvel fun, in what was advertised as quite a dark movie. The comedy in this movie is very present, but almost never when it is unwelcome. It succeeds in being funny an impressive amount of the time, while still mixing well around the dark aspects of the story. That was all balanced very nicely.  I think that this movie did a very good job with tone, I imagine it was a very difficult process to figure out how to juggle these different connecting storylines with tonally different characters originating from different movies. I thought that it was, like most of this movie, very impressively balanced and handled. Maybe once do I recall a tone shift being a little too dramatic, but that was a very minor hiccup that did not impact the overall movie whatsoever. The way they managed to balance the comedy and the menace of Thanos and his mission is quite excellent indeed.  This was what I was initially worried about, Thanos. But man I was completely needlessly worried. Thanos is easily one of Marvel's best villains to date, not just from Josh Brolin's great performance and the impressive cgi, but from the believability and engaging nature of Thanos as a villain. Thanos is such a captivating villain, and the movie does a wonderful job at showing why he believes that everything he is doing is for the greater good. Like many great villains, he believes in what he does, he's not just bad for the sake of bad. I believe the movie really sells that, which is a crucial point to his character being compelling. Equally importantly, Marvel makes its most intimidating villain in Thanos, giving the audience a feel that this movie has real stakes, that he is someone to worry about, and that when he is on the screen, one should be scared of him. I found myself very intimidated, and was almost always fearful for people in the same scene as him. Easily one of Marvel's best villains.  I think that somehow the Russo brothers managed to do a wonderful job at presenting both entertaining characters, and making them feel real and believable. It's an impressive feat to bring so many characters from so many other creator's movies into this one, and to successfully capture their characters, and make their actions believable. I think it's absolutely incredible how well this was pulled off.  Something unsurprising the Russo's pulled off was the directing. The directing and action was good, having a more epic scale than the Russo's previous two films. This one feels more grand, the camera is often much more still than would be found in their previous two movies, helping the viewer to feel more grounded and presenting the world as larger. When important action scenes were going down, I was always invested. When important character scenes were happening, I was invested.  The music was very serviceable, and helped to elevate crowd-pleasing moments and get the crowd excited. I think this movie very successfully got my Thursday night crowd excited many times, there was a great deal of applause throughout the movie. This movie really is nonstop, with endless fun, action, some truly incredible moments throughout, and some genuinely shocking material. I won't say what they were, but many of my predictions going into this movie were wrong, and this movie was all the better for it. I'm glad I wasn't given the incredible task of making such a massive film.  It is of course worth noting that the story is great, it feels absolutely epic and the proper culmination of the last ten years of Marvel. Everything manages to fit together very well, and the grand nature of it makes it endlessly entertaining to watch. The story is most useful for seeing our characters struggle against seemingly impossible circumstances.  Above all, I find this to be Marvel's most daring film to date. A tone is set with the villain of this movie, and it is not an empty one. Thanos is intimidating and terrifying, I can't say that enough. While it manages to appropriately inject fun throughout the movie, it still maintains the scary nature of Thanos. He is intimidating, and his power really feeds into a true hopelessness that infected me, something the movie captures quite well. I do believe that some of the choices made in this movie are the most daring ones made in any Marvel film to date. I do believe that these daring choices, at least for the purposes of this film, were very successful.  Overall, this movie is impressive on so many levels. It succeeds in juggling a huge cast, balancing dark and fun tones, appropriately representing characters, having impressive direction, having fantastically crowd-pleasing moments, never ceasing to engage its audience, telling a great epic of a story, as well as being Marvel's most daring film to date. There was next to nothing I took issue with over this movie, and a great deal of stuff that I absolutely loved. I was very invested throughout the whole movie, and I genuinely don't think the film could've been much better. As I have said many times throughout this review, this movie is incredibly impressive. Naturally this review won't have any sway in your decision to see this film, as you most likely either already have seen it or are doing so in the immediate future. I still would like to offer this movie my praise, as well as give it my full recommendation, as one of, if not, Marvel's best yet.", "Awesome movie full of action fun no words love you MCU", "Keeping it very short! this movie was a way to introduce Thanos, as what a way to do it! Incredible cinematic piece. And to implement all those characters and with all the stories behind them, genius.", "Marvel does justice to all the huge expectations with Infinity War. Funny as hell at times and yet super serious, this one leaves fans exhilarated, overjoyed and yet exhausted and with a lot to process after a watch. The ending leaves you desperately craving for more superhero stuff. Needless to say, the wait for Avengers 4 is going to be a REALLY loooong one. It delivers on all the hype, and then some. This is seriously essential viewing for comic and non-comic fans alike.", "This movie was an incredible spectacle and was a sight that I have been waiting to see for years! The characters were well balanced and so was the plot. Even though they used thick CGI, I still enjoyed and got used to it. The movie is a intense and thrilling ride all the way through and it definitely gave us all goosebumps to see our characters formed into something new and special. It's just that there is NO CLOSURE! Nothing. It's just not a typical superhero movie. We all knew this movie was going to be different, but we didn't know it was going to be a completely different type of superhero movie. Trust me nothing can prepare you for this.", "...It's really hard to talk about this movie without giving everything or something HUGE away. What I can tell you is the bare basics of what you will be witnessing. And that is as follows: Everything you've seen, everything you know, is wrong. Your expectations are wrong. You are not prepared for what this movie has to throw at you. YOU'RE NOT. I surely wasn't; I found myself realizing my mouth was gaped open multiple times. Avengers: Infinity War is the cultivation of everything Marvel has built and it executed it almost flawlessly. There are only two flaws that can be found here. One, the pacing is a bit wonky at parts, as scenes cut away and tones can be shifted. Two, some characters don't get the spotlight that you might want them to. But these flaws are easily forgiven. As this movie delivers on EVERYTHING. The action is exceptional. The emotion is POWERFUL. The music by Silvestri hits you in the gut with every note. The story is at odds, taking turns in ways that you will never see coming, not even with clairvoyance. Now, I can't say much, but what I will say, is that Josh Brolin has given us, quite possibly, one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. He is scary, compassionate, charismatic, but most of all, empathetic. The Russo Brothers also directed their asses off and made their best work yet. That's all I can really say. You need to go into this movie blind like I did, because by the end you won't know what's coming next, you'll be speechless. So until the next Avengers movie arrives, I'll watch it, then watch it again, because it's the only movie we got for a while.", "The movie is really really veey fantastic, I like the concept, many heroes are shown in this movie, and yeah some of the parts are funny here. Must watch in IMAX 3D.", "Avengers infinity war (IW) is, easily Marvel's gutsiest film and definitely its best. Absolutely no doubt about that. The core is pretty simple: Thanos wants the six infinity stones and the broken avengers must stop him before he vanquishes half of humanity. But the key is in the screenplay and direction. What seems impossible on paper is put together almost flawlessly by the Russo brothers.  The standout characters are Thanos, Thor, Gamora and iron man. Not that the others were bad but these 4 were really the cornerstones of the movie. Captain America, Black Panther and Black Widow disappointed a bit because they really didn't do anything apart from punching the enemy. Marvel finally got the right villain with Thanos and, for the first time I felt for a motion capture character in a live action movie. Josh Brolin is very effective and makes us actually feel something for thanos. You can argue that he's not a villain as his intentions are nice, with only his methods pretty world-ending. Thor really has great moments in the film and is perhaps at his best even more than in his solo films. Guardians are awesome as always with Gamora making you REALLY emotional. And Iron Man, well, what can we say? Robert Downey Jr just gives you the right balance the character needs, guilt, humour, compassion, bravery. You name it. Overall, IW is a really great film with super cool VFX (which surprisingly doesn't feel overdone) and great action sequences. Wait for the climax! Just mind blowing and definitely something that you'd not expect in a MCU film.", "I have to admit, Marvel is just full of geniuses. So we're in a setting where we have roughly a dozen superheroes so maybe you fear the lack of character development, insufficient movement on the plot, or perhaps you just suspect a very thin plot. Free yourselves from those perceptions and rest assured that Marvel knows what it is doing: Instead of trying to significantly build on their massive number of heroes, it almost seems to focus more on the villain, Thanos, who I believe gets the most amount of screen time in this movie. I personally found this brilliant because it doesn't over-complicate the story of any one single hero and eliminates some sense of superficiality we would often otherwise get. Each relationship between the protagonists seems believable and too much time isn't spent on a single particular protagonist. Shifting the balance to the development of the antagonist enables a great flow to the movie, both in terms of character and plot development, and it does this so seamlessly.  So prepare yourself for there is humble and perfect amount of comedy; there is action so spectacularly executed that it supersedes my imagination; there's love, loss, and even just a little heartbreak. It's truly one of the greatest roller coaster's I've been in my life. Don't go into it being overly critical and keep in open mind. Also yes, they will always continue to encourage you to spend more money with this franchise; but, you know what? - I will be more than happy to keep spending it and I think you will be too. :) Congrats on another fantastic addition to the franchise! (y)", "There are no words to describe this movie. To write a spoiler free review is almost impossible considering how much happened in this movie. Marvel has outdone themselves! Everything about this movie was incredible. You will leave the theater satisfied with action, saddened by grief, and angry at Marvel all I one!", "I dare anyone to do better...they crafted this movie with such precision and care I don't know how it could have been done better.", "Avengers: Infinity War From watching the trailers for this epic summer tent pole movie. I got the same feeling as I did when viewing the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises.\nA real sense of real peril. The feeling of dread that our beloved heroes may not make it all the way through this one.\nJust as Bane looked like the unstoppable force too powerful for The Batman to stop. \nThanos appears to be too big and bad for all the Avengers assembled together to take on.\nBoy was my initial feeling spot on!\nFrom the opening ten minutes enough happens to solidify the fact that our heroes are neck deep and some may not get to hang up their cape at the end of the day and kick back with a nice glass of Chardonnay.\nEven with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy and a couple of new recruits in the form of Spidey, Dr Strange and the Black Panther, Thanos is the villain we've been craving for.\nUnlike the poor generic CGI creation of Steppenwolf from the Justice League.\nHere we have a baddie we can believe in and most importantly fear. He has a motive and depth to his character. Not just another big smashy blow stuff up villain.\nHe is wonderfully realised on screen with a commanding performance from Josh Brolin.\nThe computer wizardry used to bring him to life is jaw dropping.\nFacial expressions look realistic and Brolin\"s performance is able to shine through. Anyway enough said about the bad guy, what about our heroes.\nI'll not go into story and plot.\nIf you are planning on seeing this you'll most likely already have the gist of things.\nIf not then going into this with no expectations will further elevate the experience.\nI can say that there's good news as everyone seems to get their moment in the sun but for me it is both Thor and Starlord that steal the show.\nIt is the scenes with Thor and the Guardians that are the highlights of the movie.\nThor in particular has risen from being the bland member of the MCU to one of the most likeable.\nHis turn in Ragnorok and now here further proves this.\nAlso this time around we get a bit more Banner and a little less Hulk, which on paper sounds disappointing but Mark Ruffalo's performance is most enjoyable.\nTom Holland as Peter the Spiderman Parker once again cements the fact that he was the right choice for the role.\nFor me he's the best onscreen incarnation of the character yet.\nBenedict Cumberbatch nails it as Doctor Strange and Robert Downey Jr once again is supremely likeable as the Ironman.\nEveryone is great but some get more screen time than others.\nIt is commendable how the Russo brothers have managed to weave everyone into the plot and give weight to their involvement in the story.\nNo one is included just for the sake of it.\nCertain characters are side lined but this is understandable and necessary to help the story proceed in part two.\nInfinity War is definitely a movie that will get even better with multiple viewings. There's so much going on that it's impossible for the human brain to absorb it all first time around. This movie may not be a perfect one but it is perfectly entertaining.\nCGI, cinematography and set design are second to none.\nOnly a scene right at the end with Bruce Banner inside the Hulk buster armour looked a little jarring.\nSound is ear shatteringly good and the score gives a real sense of dread and looming threat.\nDespite all the doom and gloom this movie still has a good dose of humour. There's something deeply satisfying in seeing all your favourite Marvel heroes from separate movies uniting and interacting with one another.\nThe Russo brothers played a master stroke in pairing certain characters together for the first time. Stark and Strange worked wonderfully together as did the aforementioned Starlord and Thor.\nAvengers: Infinity War is a ten out of ten movie for me.\nIt did exactly what I wanted it to.\nIt gave me plenty of surprises, humour, peril and action and left me hanging on.\nIt's going to be a long wait til part two rolls into theatres.", "Dare I say Thanos has beaten out The Joker for best villain in a \"comic book\" movie; He is unapologetically ruthless. From the very beginning to end, I was on the edge of my seat. Marvel truly did not hold back with this gem*no pun intended* This is a must see! I just don't know how you can top it!", "Missed a few emotional beats, but at 156 mins, there wasn't too much time to linger. Absolutely incredible film. The Empire Strikes Back comes to mind, big time.", "Get ready for an emotional roller coaster though. It'll make you laugh. It'll make you cry.  Cast is incredibly well utilized. Brolin is absolutely marvellous as Thanos, bringing complexity to what would otherwise be a generic Marvel villain.  It's an incredible movie", "Try to remember is a superhero movie not a comedy. The body is interesting and everything is trying to make u understand the meaning and the sense of the facts", "Really fantastic movie. It successfully compelet its project. Marvel is marvel.", "This is my favorite marvel movie after Winter Soldier & Avengers 1. The few bad reviews I've seen are from people complaining about the ending. Well, they obviously have never read a comic book or even bothered to look up anything about Thanos. It was obvious from day 1 that this would be a 2 part movie, if that upsets you then maybe you shouldn't be watching superhero movies or try doing some research first. Also seen a couple complaints about banner not being able to transform into Hulk after the beginning. Did none of these people watch Ragnarok? It was made very apparent he was having issues transforming back & forth. Some people just like complain about everything. Just have horrible lives & just be a joy to be arou d", "Oh my god. Incredible movie. I enjoyed seeing all the stars in one movie. I expected this movie for so long. The story is great, the cgi is flawless. Thumbs up for Russo Brothers for this incredible directing.

Good job.", "Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow", "Just returned from the cinemas after catching the all new \"Avengers: Infinity War\" flick! And my oh my this installment was quite intriguing, all personalities and events in the film intertwining seamlessly into one cosmic universe and it was indeed incredible to witness and behold. Thanos as a villain is monstrous and intimidating with menacing disposition amongst an eloquent hyperbolic parlance. I found the mumbo jumbo regarding the nature of the universe rather mystical and quasi-Buddhist with subtle quantum overtones reminiscent of Oxford colleague chatter. The action doesn't disappoint either, with karate warrior-like combat scenes and mesmerizing space expeditionary incursions. The pace of the movie is never boring with plenty of funny comedic lines and dialogue. The integrating of all the characters from differing Marvel universes brought an eclectic vibration of diversity akin to a kind of balancing act of hormonal chemistry within the egocentric network. And good lord are Scarlet Witch and Gamora hot as fsck must I say. The element of realism and CGI prowess doesn't disappoint either.. Worlds and civilizations apart envisioning want of utopian resplendence and splendor. And The Hulk and Iron Man are f-in hilarious as toast rofl, with even each single Marvel character exuding a very vibrant distinct persona and aura in impressions formed. I of course to superlative extreme had fond appreciation for the whimsical substance and way in which the plot intrigue involving the omnipotence granting infinity stones followed through towards all of my five senses! All-in-all this movie was very captivating and entertaining indeed!", "With all the hype and speculation making everyone wonder, what is really going to happen?

I'd be blue in the face to anyone who'd listen about the operatic tales I'd read about or look forward to reading. How does everyone not know about this, I'd ask. I'm sitting in my house tonight. I'm not an old man but I'm not young either.  It's like new comic book day. Because what I saw tonight was the best new comic I've read in years. Infinity War begins hard. And it never lets up.

Take your pick.", "A movie hasn't made me feel this way in a very long time. I read up on Thanos' storyline after getting home. A sliver of hope? Maybe, but I know how movies can divert from comic origins.  Jesus, stunned. What an epic movie. I know people have different opinions and all that, but truly, if someone doesn't like this movie then there's something wrong with them. Good gawd, I still ... we're floored. Rocked. Stunned. Stoked and did I say stunned? Theater watch FOR SURE! And... don't let anyone spoil it for you, holy crap.....", "The entire movie keeps me on the edge of my seat and how the movie ends with thanos just having the ending he wanted was mind blowing because no other movie has done what marvel did and that's what made Avengers Infinity War because you didn't know how it was gonna end because usually the heroes win but on this it didn't and all the characters deaths left me in tears because of how they made them die!", "I just left the theater about an hour ago, and all I can say is that I am stunned by this incredible and impossible movie. What Marvel has done with this Universe and the stunning way in which the events have led us to this event is simply mind blowing. The first ten minutes alone offer more heart and dread than nearly all of the other movies combined. Infinity War will leave you as broken as the Avengers. The guts that it took to write and create this movie is immeasurable. I simply cannot believe what I just saw. Staggering.", "First let me say that 10 years of emotions will be put into this film. From the first few minutes the intensity and tone of the film was lauded out. Prepare for deaths and all sorts of confusion. The cgi was fantastic the story really did feel like the end. Thanos was worth the six year wait it was absolutely phenomenal. Prepare for surprises, your typical MCU jokes but most importantly the tone felt like the end of an era. The action seemed more violent like they knew the stakes and the ending of this film may be the best movie ending ever. I never cry and I sobbed three times in this film. Prepare for this epic conclusion. I'm still shaking, even an hour after seeing it.", "The movie was amazing and well worth the wait. I am very pleased with it, except for one tiny thing...

My only complaint is that the CGI was pretty bad at times, especially the green screen.", "I am writing this review during the credits of my screening. My mind just got blasted into peices. Jesus Christ. Loved it but my god", "Being an avid Marvel fan I, like many others, have been along on this ride for 10 years. This movie bring to light THE main villain of the Marvel universe, Thanos, who Josh Brolin portrays to the T. Thanos is a villain that throughout the film you begin to understand more and more. They created a relatable villain for all of our favorite super heroes to fight against. With this star studded cast it is easy to think that everyone could get screen time. Though some heroes get more than others, they still all get their fair share of time. The sheer scope of the movie is beyond comprehension but they somehow made it work fluently. \nYou will laugh, you will be mad, and you will cry all at once. Never have I ever walked out of a Marvel movie without words to comprehend what I just saw. \nGo see this movie in the biggest theater you can.", "Just left opening night.

Loved it.", "This was an amazing film. So many awesome moments, so many dark moments, and it all tied into a perfect blend. I was literally holding onto the arm rest during the climax of the movie.

Best film of this year I think.", "I just saw the movie possibly one hour ago and my heart is still literally racing! I am going to say that I am 13 years old. I wasn't able to see the Iron Man movie the night it came out. The earliest Marvel movie I even remember seeing was The Avengers.  But, Infinity War is definitely my new favorite movie of all time. I do say that a lot, but I truly mean it. The story is so beautifully written and the weight of the huge ensemble is always there but it doesn't feel overwhelming.  Honestly, it broke my heart. Because there was at least one character death per half hour, and sometimes even ten. I was not expecting them to ACTUALLY kill off you know who. I didn't think they had the guts to kill Bucky. And honestly I almost cried when Peter Parker and Peter Quill died. They killed off just the right people to make you wonder 'Oh dang, Marvel's not playing around,' because they are willing to go there! This movie played with my emotions, I'm still in awe, I honestly feel dead inside. But I know that we only have about 1 year before Avengers 4, AND some characters who died are basically confirmed to return. And since Adrian Toomes from Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Killmonger from Black Panther, I'm pretty sure no one can beat Thanos villain wise.  In general, I want all people who read this to tell Marvel thank you for making me feel like I can be a superhero, even if I am in a wheelchair and can't lift a dumbbell.", "All the groundwork of the MCU previous films make this a great centerpiece with all the key elements of storytelling brought into play.", "Impossible to describe.

The ability to balance that many main characters, the ability to manage the serious and funny moments and the ability to manage the time. All these factors will make this movie an all time great.

This is a movie where the bad guy does what he says .. he completed his objective no matter what came through his way .. a mad titan like him did have tears .. that's shows love exist in him and the power of family . The best part is . They made you laugh out loud , smile and gave you goosebumps. And the the sad part came and broke us into million of pieces. Eagerly desperately waiting for the next sequel !", "This film nailed every aspect, - comedy, action, plot. Everything was perfect. The way they built up the final battle was truly significant and with all marvel films, the CGI and cinematography was truly ahead of its time. A truly magnificent masterpiece of a film", "The past months my expectations for this movie were increasing and increasing until the point I was worried wether the movie could live up to it and, oh boy, it sure did! Infinity War delivers a great job with combining all these superheroes into a spectacular though emotional collage. Which is a difficult job because every character could be banished into a smaller role because there's simply not more screentime to give. \nBut no, that didn't happen, the story doesn't dissappoint and even contains some special surprises, some more subtile than others. \nThumbs up for the directors and the writers to master this collision of all built up Marvel storylines. What got me the most personally was the deeper dig into the backgrond story of Thanos and Gamora and their relationship, because it brought more depth to the movie. \nThis review contains no spoilers, especially a sensitive subject with this movie, but the ending only hungers for the next suite... just one year to go. A must see for every superheroe fanatic, movielover or just the periodic movietheater visiter. \nSo I hope you can use the same adjectives as I did in the title!", "Easily Marvels best film! The Ruso brothers had a tremendous task of taking 10 years worth of Marvel films and putting it together into one epic film, and then succeeded. As for Thanos he's esily the best MCU villain, his character has so much depth, he's not your average bad guy and Josh Brolin plays the Mad Titan so well. I'll be seeing this movie a few more times for sure!", "After starting with the first Iron Man 10 years ago and teasing for the first time the big underlying villain that would be Thanos 6 years ago in the first Avengers movie, we have finally arrived to what it all was building up for, and it was well worth the wait.\nThe Movie has an incredible story told in a incredibly paced format, all the characters seem important and are able to shine in their due time, not only that but the comedy was just right and the team ups and fight scenes in the movie are the best I have ever seen. Thanos is without a doubt the best villain we've seen in this universe so far, not only for the long foreshadow but also because of his motivations that are perfectly explained and in a way which every viewer can, in a way, understand why he believes he has to do his mission. Beyond that, the relationships between characters are explored and developed in a brilliant way, which makes the movie feel more alive combined with the perfect editing that makes the two and a half our movie fly by. I must also mention that not only the CGI was amazingly done and detailed but the whole movie had stunning visuals that showed us the amazing universe that was created for this experience.\nAt last, the story ended with an unexpected and wholesome bang, that made me not only tear but also feel complete. I loved every bit of this movie and I certainly recommend it to everyone, but i do recommend you to watch the prior movies in order to feel the correct attachment to the characters and to understand how well thought out the MCU was.", "Good story, good set up for another film. But for me even though the film is 2 and a half hours long it still felt a bit rushed through", "Hello! \nJust a short and sweet review on Infinity Wars. It was amazing. The humor was good and not forced. The action is the best I have seen. Thanos is THE best villain. The atmosphere you get from the film is like no other marvel film, you get excitement, fear, jaw dropping moments and it is just a thrill. The screen I was in ended up clapping after and rightly so!  Every actor and actress were great\nMy favourites were Robert, Tom, Benedict, Both Chris and Josh Brolin.  I hope everyone enjoys it like I did.  Thank you Russo Brothers", "This is my first review on here so gonna keep it short and simple. I saw Avengers Infinity War at the midnight showing and it was so worth it, the film exceeded all my expectations and as soon as the credits rolled, I wanted to watch it again. Full of laughs and shocking moments that you won't see coming. This is one of the best superhero films ever made, GO AND WATCH IT!!! I'll be going watching this again at the cinema, no doubt about it.", "This movie is a cash cow for a good reason...it is an exciting first of a two part conclusion to the build up of Marvel super heroes over the past decade, beginning with Iron Man, leading the fight to Thanos's realm. I watched it in Cinemark XD which was a let down, then second time in Dolby AMC and finally in AMC IMAX. The IMAX experience was the best and I can't wait to own an Infinity War bluray to add to my collection. Furthermore, this movie is a great conversation starter with family members and friends to discuss what happens next. The visuals are stunning, the sound is fantastic and the standout characters were Thanos and Thor. This movie is approaching 2 billion dollar mark and hopefully it should reach it, because it is worth your money spent. I highly suggest IMAX, it was awesome. Looking forward to the second part in 2019!", "A film filled with dull, naive and whiny \"super\" heroes.", "Some of scene make me shock some scene make me imotional too. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones.  One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. If You are a MARVEL fan Or If You Are a Superhero Fan Definetely Yo Will Like It.But You Need to Watch Previous Marvel Movies.", "I was so upset when black panther,spiderman and starlord died. They are all characters that have brought humour and action to avengers. Also the ending has left me wanting more. It ended way too soon.", "You can find every legend and mythology in this f movie and it makes sense and all make sense and you can find every warrior scene you want and new characters will surprise you and i loved it by myself it was amazing", "These superhero movies keep getting worse and worse.", "Ok, first of all more and less everybody seen this movie so far - so i will refer to these negative comments here. First of all time shouldn't allow everyone to add here review. I look most of this 1-3/10 accounts profile and there are mostly created in 2018 without any activity but negative on this movie. So there are trols and multy accounts of some group from DC extremists or general haters of everything. IMDb should ban this trols. Second, for every SCFi fan, or Comic Fan, this is masterpiece of our time. Avengers on big screen and they are epic ... WTF do you want more? yes i want too ... that Justice Ligue is half good as this one but hey at least we have one good and one epic i 2 years :)) 3rd this is not 'part movie', this is complete movie and it follows conquest of Thanos. He starts, he collects, he fights and he .... SPOILER ... the end, movie is over. They don't need to made any other Avengers nor any other movie to finish story.", "I had a look at like 200 reviews, and they are all rated either 9,10 or 1,2. This only shows that people hardly describe a movie objectively. Still, I believe that the main score of 8.8 is way too much, because after all, this is a superhero movie, which means easy plot, villain against the good guy/s, and good vs evil. \nHaving this said, this movie was average, not bad but not brilliant. Its target is mostly teenagers or 20yo people, and gives them what they want. There is a lot of action, the story is shallow, but the writers managed to show so many characters in a balanced way. Besides being a movie almost entirely make with CGI which seems to be unavoidable these days ( and that brings away most of the acting) the ending is the part that leaves your mouth bitter. Thanos is an interesting villain, he has a purpose, that in some ways makes sense, he doesn't just kill everyone because he wants to, but in the end it is clear that soon another Marvel movie will come out and it will rewrite entirely this one, because they simply can't kill half of the superheroes. This is a classic of every superhero movie ever: the bad guy needs some artifact to become immortal/god/open a gate to another dimension, the heroes have the chance to defeat him before that but fails, and so the villain becomes God but gets defeated anyway. In this movie is the same. When I exited the cinema I was more annoyed by the fact that another movie will change everything happened in this one than the fact that the bad guy actually wins, and this made me feel that I watched a movie for nothing. I could accept this ending as it is.\nPeople need to keep in mind that the good guys don't always win.\nAnyway, as a superhero movie is ok but there are better ones, like V for Vendetta or Wonder woman, but there are others that are much worse, like Green Lantern or Black Panther. \nAnother thing I should mention is that in order to watch this movie you are supposed to watch almost all the other Marvel movies, or you won't understand many scenes. This can be a good way to connect different movies, but now there are like 18 so it's too much.\nI can't say much on the acting, it was ok but the CGI has the main role, and fans don't really care about it.\nSo to sum up this is an average superhero movie, with a great villain but a silly plot, that relies on random deaths of its characters to cause suspance, which is cheap. I only went to the cinema because I have free tickets, it is only worth the money if you're fan of the series or of special effects.", "Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks.  And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible.  But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters. The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe.  From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it.  That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity Wars is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts. And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, \"We don't trade lives\", even when giving up one could save billions.  There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling.  For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight.  Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe. In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero m\u00eal\u00e9e that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it. Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.", "I was greatly anticipating this film and it did not disappoint. Of course we all see the MCU big and grand which it is and then some. \n You literally have to be a Marvel fan to understand the story line and had to have watched all the movies to get to this point. As a movie goer you have to invest the time to fully critique it. \n The characters I have come to enjoy and I feel the majority of all top billed actors embody the superhero or villain persona and play it well. \n You can also read the comics to get an idea of where the director will possibly go next in part 2. \n From comic book to the big screen Disney has achieved what most studios wish they can do in the super hero arena and be extremely successful at it. Kuddos to them and I'm delighted Marvel is in such good hands. \n Lastly, I read some reviews on here which I carefully dissected and I've come to the conclusion they did not read comics or just not Marvel fans. I recommend reading before critiquing.\n Just admit it was a great film and if you were asked to take part in the next film as an extra or actor you'd raise your hand immediately. That's all!", "Amazing throughout.. ! Thanos is probably the best villain to hit screen on par with Heath ledgers joker.", "Throughout the whole movie, you're feeling many emotions and you start to feel everything that the heroes are feeling. Every second of this movie amazed me", "Kdkxkdkdkxkxkkxxkkxmxmxmsksmrnrkfkdklsp protestolar nedeniyle bu", "Congratulations to everyone who worked for this film. Thank you for making the best Superhero film we've seen till now. At last, a film with real screenplay, direction, characters, emotion, action, CGI, humor, fun, entertainment that keeps you locked inside the screen from the first moment to the last. I hope and wish the next Avengers film to be also that good.", "This is a story about a being who wants to save the universe. Who sees the big picture and know's that no matter what the cost, be it family or fame, he will sacrifice all to save trillions. Some people call him the villian, but will he be remembered as a savour ? Are the Avengers putting their selfish needs ahead of the greater good, only time will tell.", "This was a very easy watch, it's non stop action which really helps you loose yourself in the world of cinema. That being said I left the theatre wondering what were they thinking, it had at least two major flaws in the plot which are huge and very noticeable. I think it gets 7* as it was very watchable and quite funny also the special effects were as usual flawless.", "This was a great start to a complex plot movie series. If you are left with what the heck? \"No they didn't just kill all my favorite characters\", then spot on Marvel! I look forward to your resolution of this conundrum. Seamless CGI, sound and music carefully applied, compelling overall.", "Due to the most recent release of Avengers: Infinity War, the writer of this review has abstained from writing the movie review on this movie.", "My expectation were high about this movie going to the cinema. The result is, it may be the best superhero movie I've ever seen. The effort put in this movie is seen in every frame from the beginning. The script is very well thought through, every sentence feels legitimately polished and the humour in the movie is very pure, which makes it highly entertaining. There's a lot happening in the movie, but it's really easy to follow all the events as they happen in a really well fit pattern as everything comes together in the end. Furthermore, I would say Thanos as a character amazed me the most. He has the most substantiate ideology I've ever seen in a superhero movie as he explains his point of views throughout the movie which made even myself ponder. His character overall makes him one of the best movie villain ever. I went to see the movie with my girlfriend who hadn't ever seen a Marvel movie and had no interest in the Marvel Universe at all. As we watched the movie she was clung to her seat the entire time as she experienced all the emotions possible from the scale of sadness to rage. She was blown away as how good the movie is even more than me. The film is for all the audience out there, not just for boys or people who fancy superhero movies. If you enjoy a good movie, I'm sure that this will exceed your every expectation. This is not just another superhero movie, this is THE superhero movie.", "Great film that I throughly enjoyed throughout with great action scenes, CGI and even great jokes. But what I loved most of all was Thanos and that he really had character and actual emotion and I could really see the story from his point of view unlike most other villains in films theses days that are just megalomaniacs or blood thirsty antagonists.", "A perfect beginning of the end for the previous phases of the MCU. For 10 years Marvel has been carefully building their universe and all of the movies led to this moment. It triggered so many emotions that I've lost count. Perfect action scenes, characters, visuals and so much more. I dare to say, without a doubt, that this is the greatest superhero movie of all times. 2019 and Part II can't come soon enough. All that's left now is wait for the denouement and introduction of new characters, and new stories that come along with them.", "Best MCU film yet. Brolin in his role of Thanos was great. Very intense throughtout, the story was brilliant , most MCU fans would be disappointed with the ending but this wasn't a film focusing on the hero's for once.", "Hands down Thanos is the best CGI villain ever put to film. He's a compelling character and you can feel he's a real-life human (except he's not). Josh Brolin performance makes Thanos even more realistic and humane. His motion-capture performance adds up to the character of Thanos, and that's really unusual or maybe doesn't happen unless we had Andy Serkis. The CGI in general is very good.  Thanos has many great moving moments when he explains his motives, but despite how indirect and classy he illustrates his motivations, I hoped there were more ways to do so rather than using dialogue and nothing more. Also, I think there was no need for more explanations in the third act of the movie. C'mon, there is a final battle happens and Thanos still gives some reasons why he does that!  There's an incredible chemistry between almost all our heroes, and that enhanced the humor in this movie which, by the way, is splendid! Almost every joke hits the mark. The problem that there was a tonal shift between the first act and the second act that made a dramatic scene not as effective as it should have been, but it's really a very minor issue as it just happened one time. The character development features all along the movie itself not just as a complement to the previous movies. There are a lot of shocking moments and unflinching decisions that you have never seen in a Marvel movie. I have never been confused by the story's developments or many events as all of them are represented simply. Actually even simpler than in some other MCU movies. The Russo Brothers showed how much they understand every single character in the universe by changing the tone according to the characters and the place. \n(9/10)", "Good story, but seemed slow and too many major characters fighting for the lead...entertainment wise it was fun, but it won't win any oscars and like the Star Wars franchise, Disney are slowly killing off the franchises...but then it could be a build up to the next sequel.", "If you understand MCU really well, have watched all the 18 movies before this one and all the TV series connected to the universe, you will emotionally shaken realize that the stakes are really high. The Russo Brothers are clearly understand what makes MCU works. Nearly everu character has their own shining moments, the team-up was FANTASTIC, and the call from the past was unbelievable. I still can't believe what I just watched.", "Okay so first of all i went to the cinema with high expactations with Both Marvel fans an non Marvel fans ! So first a was chocked by everything it was so much feelings for me as a Marvel fan and also nostalgic!  The other who where non Marvel fans was just sittning trough the film and didn't say anything ! Everyone was staying after the credit scene and after the cinema screen was closed everyone tough this movie was great !  everyone was Happy sad (just me)XD and just enjoyed the film and Said it was really good One of the best !  This is the biggest movie ever done and it's live upp to everything", "Everything about this movie was so perfect and epic, it's what we had been waiting for many years! Just wow...what a ride of feels! I enjoyed every second and can't wait to see how it continues. So much fun humor, action scenes, music, lots of characters etc... The best villain. Also that ending omg.", "Sad and depressing movie, made my day ruined, I really don't know why people were so hyped for this lol", "Great balanced(excuse the pun, Thanos) film that worked with over 20 characters, which could over totally toppled over with too many characters. A good continuation of the marvel universe that took a lot of chances.  I can only imagine the people that are rating this as 1 star are the ones that are trying to stick up DCs sorry excuse for a franchise. I'm not a Marvel fan boy but I have enjoyed every marvel film that has been released due to good script, good acting and a good plan for this franchise to carry on so far. Marvel/disney....bravo.", "To really understand this movie you need to see all the other mcu movies. If you haven't and then gives it a bad review you are either a liar, troll or a DC fan hating the mcu. This movie offers everything a true marvel fan/true superhero fan can wish for. Great action scenes, great plot and great spesial effects! The movie is about thanos collecting the infinity stones and the name is \u00abInfinity war\u00bb. To all the people giving it a bad review, how in gods name did you think it was going to go? It's a all out war and destiny has arrived. See all the other mcu and come back to me. If not, you review is incorrect and overruled.", "Truly Avengers Infinity War it's the best Marvel movie.It lived its hype and it was a big shock for all the fans.Fantastic but sad too. This movie is different than any kind of superhero movie and it had a lot of twists.The action and the acting was perfect and evey scene of the film was exciting.I recommend it to everyone because even if you're not a regular watcher of Marvel you will like this movie.", "This is one of the best live action movie ever...Robert D Jr was best among all the heros.", "Best avengers movie.  Great actions. The team successfully linked several story lines into one and created this master piece.  \nbut my heart is really broken after watching it. Can't say why here. :(", "I absolutely loved this film. The way the characters we know and love we re-introduced was brilliantly done and just thrilling to see on the big screen. The only reason I couldn't give it a 10/10 is because of the \"deaths\" at the end of the film. The ink death that effected me was Spider-Mans because of Tom Holland's amazing performance. It was hard to mourn these characters when it was clearly obvious they'd be coming back somehow because of all the future film announcements. You can't have Guardians of the Galaxy 3 with just Rocket. Other than that. Go see this in theatres if you get a chance to. The film is action packed and hilarious because of the connection between the characters. This really is what DC is missing out on in their films.", "Marvel has been building up to this for 10 years, with 18 movies. Every movie from Iron Man, to Guardians of the Galaxy, The Avengers, Thor, and Captain America and more, every character has gotten character development. We have gotten to know these characters and they feel like family. Seeing these characters on the screen, cracking jokes and going through emotional moments puts so much on the audience when you've stayed with the MCU through these years.  Infinity War does not have time to have people stop punching to develop the story and there characters. They have done that in every movie for the past 10 years and that's not a complaint. But let's be honest, when we see these movies we want it to be fast paced and deliver a lot of comedy and tons of actions. The characters are so likeable and strong because the story has stakes, we've gotten to know everyone enough now we have to make it through the end of the filming hoping they all survive. Marvel has always had a villain problem. Most of the MCU's villains are weak, but this movie belongs to Thano's. This is really his story and the heroes just revolve around him. He's a big baddie but you sympathize with him and he's very hateable...but also very likeable. You see him have emotions internally with himself and whenever he makes bad choices it devastates you because you just want him to do the right thing, but at the end of the day, what he believes is right is kind of valid so theees not a lot of arguing. When I said earlier in this review that some would rather see a lot of action but intriguing characterization, Thano's as a characters delievrs on that untrusting character development while the heroes take care of the rest. The heroes in the movie are so much fun to watch. All of the worlds collide into one movie and seeing them interact is so epic and funny. The chemistry between every actor is amazing. Star lord getting upset with Thor's good looks is hilarious, Tony Stark bantering with Doctor Strange is intriguing, Thor hanging out with Rocket Raccoon and Groot is a trio that works to a great advantage. And of course, the rest of the Avengers are also great to see come together, down on earth. This movie feels like a reward for all the fans who have stuck with these characters for a decade. It's a huge celebration and the movie is so deep with the theme of failure and the plot twists are still surprising on a second viewing. The movie had me gasping for air through the whole run time, everything had a consequence and it's a experience unlike any other superhero flick I've seen. Past MCU movies have felt like you were reading a comic book...but this movie felt like a comic book. I felt like every shot and scene were truly a comic book ripped from pages and I experienced it come to life.", "First of all i am not a Disney fanboy, i hated Star Wars 7 and 8 (6 and 3 on IMDB). Second i am not a Marvel fanboy, i didnt like Iron Man 3, Avengers 1, spiderman homecoming and i was upset about Black Panther.\nBut its hard, to describe this one other than epic. These scenes, a perfect villian and the music guide you through a movie that is by far one of the best movies in the last 3 years. Yeah sure its not inception or interstellar but the movie doesnt want to be that kind of movie. Its high end action, best cgi i have seen so far and the best version of Cap, Thor etc. I have seen. Don't belive those haters, this is highly entertaining.\nI don't know anybody personal who has seen it and didnt love it. \n(Please excuse my english.)", "Infinity War is the best superhero movie I've ever seen.", "Berry good berry noicee love it berry good scarlet so hotjakd", "Let me start by saying that no superhero movie is supposed to be realistic. We all know that. Still, script writers, and comic books writers too struggle, to make the story feel as if it was real, otherwise, none would relate to the story. In order to get this real feeling, the emotional base of the story is crucial, the character development must be first class, if these two work, we've got a film we can emphathize with, we might even forget the entire premise is unreal. But very often the writers don't trust their own ability. Sometimes they feel the whole story is so farfetched they have to go an extra mile to make it more real. That's when things start going wrong. That's where it went wrong for this movie. I never expected a real life drama, if that was what I wanted I wouldn't be watching this movie to begin with.  It's very hard to explain my point precisely without spoilers, and I don't do spoilers. So what can I say. I can say that by the movie's end we're left with two choices, both steming from a desire to make the story feel more real, maybe to surprise us more than we usually get surprised in movies we came to know so well. Any which way, the two options we're left with are either, the entire movie will be reversed in the next installment. Which means that the whole Infinity War was a teaser for the next MCU installment. Or the entire MCU is getting a reboot.  I hate both options. And it's a great shame, because otherwise we had a perfectly good installment in the MCU. With the great sense of humor we all know and love. With great acting performances (Josh Brolin is really superb, making Thanos one of the greatest villains we ever saw), wonderful cinematography and CGI and everything else we come to expect of the MCU. If everybody loves it so much, why do we need to reboot it, when it's still going so very well. Or else why would you waste an entire installment as a teaser for the next one. We already know all the installments are connected to each other, we all wait for the post credits scenes, no matter how long we have to sit in the dark. So why did we need this silly concoction. It didn't make it feel more real, it made me feel frustrated and even angry because whatever option will come into being in the future I'll still think this one was a waste of my time and everybody else's.", "If you didnt watch this peace of art yet you should run to watch it", "Mad mad this is a good watchvghhjjjlgndxjjxcccbkcckdkxkdjdidusdi", "Well first of all, maybe 9 is a little too much for the movie I prefer giving it like a 8.6 but since I am still under the effect of the film, I give a 9. Aaaaaanyway... Okay so, first off, the visuals - they are amazing. 10/10 visuals. Period. Second, the plot. This might be best part of the movie. And the best thing about it is that it is unpredictable. Loki dies in the first 5 minutes, guess the rest. Also it is written well and very professionally. But there are some mistakes about humor, like yes, this is the classic Marvel type humor but maybe it's just me, but there were a LOT of unnecessary jokes were not that funny and inappropiate for their current situation at all. All aside that ending is probably the best avengers ending in my opinion. Like Thanos said, after he did it, he really woke up in a different place, watching the sunset, away from it all. And the unexpected thing is that all of the new people turn to dust - wow didn't expect that. Not bad yet a weird way to go. But their \"death\" scenes were really emotional and nicely acted, and it was a smart twist. However, my humble opinion about this is that one of the main avengers should have been gone, but hey that's me! Back to movie. Some may disagree but I definitely think that it deserves the hype. It is a different and yet still the same Marvel style movie with unexpected litle twists and all. Acting was good in my opinion, however I cared more about the plot so I may have missed some bad parts or so. If you are not a huge Marvel fan, it may be disappointing for you, but it is all opinions anyway. I don't want to say something like true fans will like it or something. (I am a star wars fan since my childhood, and I saw the The Last Jedi and some people started to go around telling that true fans loved it. False. They hated it.) This movie is definitely worth watching. Go see for yourself!", "I've tried to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible as I really want everyone to go in and be surprised. Since there may be minor spoilers, I have tagged it as such. First of all...WOW. It honestly blew me away. I truly don't think we've had a superhero film feel this epic yet. And it gave you a bit of everything too. It was dark, it was emotional, it was full of twists, but also knew when to make you laugh and smile. There was a nice balance. \nOne of my big worries going into the movie was the sheer size of the cast and how that would be balanced. And I think it was pulled off well. Yes, there are some characters that get more screen time/lines and there were a few that werent in the movie at all. But, I felt it was all a decent amount of screentime (no one feels like a glorified cameo). And the thing with having such a big cast like this, is seeing all the various team ups. For the most part it seems to follow 3 different groups. One on Earth and 2 in space. But even when some of the characters do join another group, that was great as well. I smiled so much at the interaction between Winter Soldier and Rocket. Or Cap and Groot. And speaking more specifically about the characters there were a few that really stood out to me and were my favourites in this. First is Cap. Now, I've always liked Cap and his movies. Winter Soldier has been my favourite movie so far (although I honestly think that honestly might be replaced with this one). But in this one, he's just so especially baller. Like, I dont think people give him enough credit when it comes to the \"strong\" Avengers. But my god, he really holds his own against Thanos. Second standout is Thor. One of the biggest reasons is that he gets some more of the more emotional moments. There is a scene where he is talking about how he has nothing else to live for now (his family is gone, his friends are gone, his home is gone etc) and I legit was tearing up. It was such a great scene, well acted. Hit me in the gut. He also has another great scene earlier when he finds out that Gamora is Thano's daughter and everyone expects he's gonna start a fight, but instead he justs pats her on shoulder and tells her that it's ok. Family is complicated. Plus, of course he also just gets some really badass moments too. Gamora also is a standout. Again, there's lots of really great emotional scenes with her. Specifically scenes with her and Thanos. She despises him and wants to take him down and yet and the same time has this connection with him and it is hard for her. And Zoe as well just really does a great job. Thanos is also one of the HUGE standouts. There's been a couple of good villains so far in the MCU (mostly forgettable) and Thanos tops the cake. Like, he is honestly scary. And he's powerful. Like, our heroes definitely try their hardest but they just can't best him. And its honestly a bit refreshing to see. Plus, he also doesnt come across as a one note, mustache-twirling villain. This is a guy who honestly thinks what he is doing is for the greater good and to bring peace. And he does care for Gamora. And Josh Brolin also just does a great job. And the mo-cap is really good and can make you forget at times that you're watching a CG character and not a real person.  Story wise, also good. I had a small gripe that Thanos already has the power stone at the beginning, and so you never know if the characters that you meet in the first GOTG movie like Glenn Close and John C Reilly's characters are ok. But I also understand that it was likely due to time. I mean, you cant show everything unless you want this to be over 3 hours long. And they had a lot to get through, and I think it was balanced well. The reality stone was really cool and Im suprised he didnt use it more, cause I think it would have really effed up some people. I did like that there was a theme of sacrifice. More specifically sacrifice for the greater good. It pops up a number of times. With Gamora and Star Lord. With Gamora and Thanos. With Vision and Scarlet Witch. Even Doctor Strange does.  It does set up so many questions and possible theories for the next Avengers installment, but honestly I'm excited. I think the first Avengers film is going to play a big importance in it. That it will come full circle in a way.", "Nothing about this movie is memorable. The story was so bad that had to be sololy to make another movie after this which they did.", "The Russo brothers are just fantastic at directing these types of films. And for one I love this ending, this ending is better than any other MCU film. One of my top 5 favorite MCU film up to date. Loved it and I just can't wait for Avengers 4. 10/10", "Did not disappoint. \nWhat a brilliant start to part one of two. \nI found my self leaning to team thanos we defo see a side to him finally after 20 movies that have been building up to this.

Just right behind Logan, Avengers: Infinity war did what the justice league never could. Pull people into the story. I felt like I was there fighting side by side with Iron-man and Cap. Not once did I stare at the stupid screen in my pocket. Not once did my eyes get droopy from weariness. Not once did I go, 'they could've done that better.' Emotional, funny, action packed, perfect writing, and entertaing as all get out. Simply superb. 10/10", "Russo's brothers warned us that would have been an unforgettable movie, but neither in my best dreams i could expect something like that. The characters are perfectly managed, lots subplots that risked of weight down add something new, and their characterization gives me goosebumps beacuse of his consistency. See the characters we love interact between them is as funny as serious, because of Thanos's imminent threat, wich here is simply monstrous. One of Marvel's biggest problems has always been the villain, often too flat and stereotypical, Thanos instead it's all the opposite and He gives us a memorable villain, with which you empathize and that behind the Motion Capture hides a heart and a soul. From a technical point of view the film reaches roofs never topped, with breathtaking visual effects and a fast and frenetic direction, which in the fightins gives the best of itself. While not having a dark stile, the film proposes mature and tragic's themes, answering a lots of questions but leaving us with many questions marks wich will presumably be unveiled in the next chapter. My only issue is in my opinion the hurry with which the final battle was managed, although this defect is blown away by the end. Russo's brothers have been able to do what 10 years ago(release of the first Marvel movie) seemed impossible and they did it dosing everything perfectly, everyone has his role to play within the story. Nobody is indispensable, but everyone is necessary to face a threath wich concerns them closely and that risks to undermine everything they care about. Humour is not exaggerated, but on the contrary, it contrasts very well with the dark's themes, and Guardians of the Galaxy fit perfectly. Like it or not, Avengers Infinity War is destined to enter in the history of cinema, for social and economic importance, it's the culmination, the apotheosis of 10 years of hard work, and It won't be Pulp Fiction or Citizen Kane but is a genre mastepiece. On conclusion Avengers Infinity War is destined to become iconic, it's epic, unforgettable, exciting and courageous and despite some little defects it's going to be one of the best entertaining movie ever made, if not the best.\nScore: 94%", "This movie has thousands of visual effects shots - and except for a few tiny moments, they are all designed, rendered and composited very professionally. You can't get much better. But now for the bad part - I always had reservations that Disney corp. would make superhero films neutered of real menace, too franchise-ey and too polished/bland and that, in effect, is what's wrong with the film. The script is frequently tone-deaf, as in totally unrelated to the onscreen action or dramatic conflict, which was an issue with previous entries, and the overstuffed \"Civil War\" (this film's ending is ripped from Birth of a Nation, but so are hundreds of titles in the action/adventure/fantasy genre).  Basically, the best parts of the film are supposed to be balls-out breathless action sequences between the Marvel hero's cast and Thanos, a demon-like intergalactic warrior, except Disney, in all it's marketing \"wisdom\", rob ALL the action scenes of drama with inappropriate, flat \"quips\" to carefully telegraph to parents that this is just a 'fun movie' with nothing more at stake than a bit of fun and some wiz-bang VFX. That, in a nutshell, is what's wrong with the film - in an attempt to please an audience who are increasingly exhausted from forty-five previous sequels in the tights-and-CGI genre, they put EVERYTHING into the movie from the Marvel comics canon, but then rob the movie of any real charm or menace with an awful script. Isolated scenes throughout play really well, but whenever the movie's supposed to hit overdrive and turn into a real \"ride\", the dialogue is annoyingly lame. I rate the film at a \"six\" instead of a \"three\" because of the artful VFX, backdrops, sci-fi props and digital camera moves. Oh - I forgot to mention; the bad guys plan is super-lame also! Great animation, great costume, great backdrop. Lame dramatic goal, therefore the entire film is tainted with an undying lameness that you can't quite shake off, no matter how much key scenes impress. Worth pirating, if you can push a few buttons and it's raining outside . . .", "I walked into this frightened that there would be too man characters a the result would be an empty vacant shell of a movie that was pulled in so many different directions ti couldn't make sense of itself. Yay, I was wrong. Seriously, they did a good enough job. They focused on Gomorrah, Thor, and Strange and Stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. And they rest they used as filler, with only the Vision story coming up a bit light due to population. And the Vision story was a bit of a draw back. It was there but it wasn't, at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too so. The Humor was also scaled back. But Spider Man did a good job, Cap had a few and, again, it was only Panther and the Wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a Marvel movie....again. I'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the MCU that it is find if the Black Panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. We won't mind.  The tone was more action than action/comedy...but with \"War\" in the title, you kind of expect that. However, they do NOT even address the elephant in the room...why did Widow go blond? Was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. The world may never know. What we do know is that we missed Hawkeye, even if he is on and off again retired. And we missed Ant-Man, but given how many people were here, the absences were noted but not really noticed.", "OK, as I watched this movie with great expectations at first I felt like there were jut too many characters and not enough storyline development. All these Avengers and friends were bunched into 2.5 hours and there just didn't seem to be enough time for each of them. But remembering this is part 1 of 2 parts, settles me down. And it is, more or less, a culmination of sorts of many years of Avenger movies. So part 2 will be a must see and I can hardly wait. The worst thing about Infinity War is that it cuts off way to early and leaves the viewer wanting MORE. The best things about this movie are the villian Thanos...you love, hate and feel pity for him. But you also understand what he's saying. And thank God that Thor gets his eye back. I was not looking forward to a one-eyed Thor. AND he gets a new \"hammer\" in the form of a super ax. There are parts in this movie that are so cool you just want to clap out loud. The one-liners are there, too, and they are funny but you have to be fast to catch 'em. Especially when the audience is laughing out loud. I missed seeing Jeremy Renner's character (Hawkeye) wonder why they left him out?  This is definitely what I call a \"bridge\" movie, because it connects another movie(s) to a movie that isn't released yet. Frankly, at the end of the movie when the screen goes black, I was thinking, \"What? They're going to leave me now?!\" I was kind of disappointed. BUT upon further reflection, it needed to be done this way or else make a 6.5 hour movie. (I felt the same thing with the Lord of the Rings, \"The Two Towers\" movie...another bridge movie). But settling down I have to say this is a great movie even if it leaves you wanting for much more. Hopefully part 2 will be released soon...in 2019? I can dream.", "Best best best movie eveeeeeer , I can seen this movie millions of times and never get bored", "I knew almost all about this movie before I saw it: Superheroes disagree amongst themselves, but must stand together against some CGI villain, This CGI villain is off to destroy a city.... no wait, we've already done that, the World..... no wait, we've done that too, THE UNIVERSE, and the superheroes more less prevail in the end, leaving some sort of cliffhanger though to ensure further profits from the next instalment. Please... a little more orginality next time, Marvel?", "To me it is the best movie I have seen till now. It has emotion, jokes, seriousness, everything in it. Infinity War portrayals Thanos very well. He seems almost human. \nSo it is a amazing movie, a must see", "Does anyone know how great it is to watch the third and fourth movies in a row?", "In the process of returning to the past time nodes to change the future, the heroes also stringed up a previous Marvel series of movies, so that many things have a complete account, but also make the characters more three-dimensional full. When the Captain picked up the Thor hammer, there was a small climax in the theater; when the little spider-man came back, it was also a small climax. The Captain ridiculed their American hips, and when he were attached to the person who wanted to catch him in the elevator and said \"Hooray for Hydra \", people who understand were happy. The magnificent fighting scene looks super cool on the big screen of the cinema. In the end, Iron Man's self-sacrifice is really embarrassing. I love you 3000 times, too.", "Negative points:\n", "I'm almost wordless, and.....LOTR is my no.1 movie of all-time, and Avengers: Infinity War is another LOTR to me, still I love LOTR better, but it's just because LOTR filled with great motivational messages, this is the only difference, put aside this IW = LOTR, or maybe even better than LOTR. Hats off... Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War", "Still remains the best Marvel film, in my opinion.", "Even with the Russo brothers directing Infinity War, I was never certain a film could work on this scale. So many sci-fi elements, so many characters... it was so far from the grounded film the Russos made before and Marvel was going into even more bombastic territory than GOTG or the Thor films. What would decide if this film could work was going to be its villain and its usage of its characters. I'm happy to say that it succeeded in all fronts. The pacing in this film is quick and impeccable. Every character gets something to do, albeit some more than others. Its villain, Thanos, is likely the MCU's most compelling villain and the core of the film. He is not only intimidating and dread-inducing, but also sympathetic. This film is also incredibly dark with violent deaths, a grave tone, and writing that lacks much hope. This film has an emotional core, shocking themes, and amazing action. The CGI is fabulous, the score is masterful, and the visuals are eye-popping and wonderful. Infinity War is the best of the Avengers films, and will be remembered for decades as the masterful pinnacle of this cinematic universe, a decade in the making and well worth the wait.", "The movie is awesome\nIf anyone want to understand the Avengers The endgame, they should watch this movie The most important thing in this movie is the weapon Thor got (Stormbreaker) which is really one of the strongest weapon as it fail the attack of gauntlet", "This movie had me anticipating the moment to watch the Endgame.", "They needed to work on Writing. Movie is very slow and Time Machine Concept they used were not fully illustrated. Thanos character needed to show more in a Proper Way. Overall One Time Watch movie Last 30 Minutes were the Best. Rest of the movie were all Talking and Talking", "Not knowing there would be a sequel, this ending trumps all endings ever. Knowledge is power, but ignorance is truly bliss", "Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most visually stunning movies ever put to screen, that includes the outstanding cinematography, brilliantly choreographed action sequences, a beautifully written script (improved by the incredible performances) and plot. It changes what we expect from a marvel movie, pretty much all of the marvel movies had the same structure until infinity war, for once the heroes are loosing, and don't walk into the sunset triumphant in the end. Since The Avengers in 2012, Thanos has always been an excuse to have a post-credit scene, but Josh Brolin steals the show with his performance as the mad titan, this doesn't feel like an avengers movie, it feels like a Thanos movie... and thats a good thing. And then the final scene happens, the movie could of ended with Captain America in Wakanda but no, the movie ends with Thanos, the very last scene has no talking its just a completely visual treat, theres no evil laugh from Thanos at the end, just a smile; and when the screen goes black everyone is left in amazement at the fact for the first time.. the heroes lost... and the villain won, Josh Brolin makes his character feel more sinister than ever before, mix that with lovable characters, great humour and breath-taking action, and you have yourself one of the finest pieces of cinema ever put to screen.", "I watched it twice then i realize, why i cant make a review for the movie that you consider it the best of all time 10/10 .", "I haven't ever watched any Marvel movies before this.. my friend told me that this movie is awesome so I bought tickets for it.. after watching it I couldn't understand what happened.. then I started watching all the movies chronologically... And today I watched Endgame.. thank you Marvel", "Avengers infinity war is great.\nI will keep it short cause the reasons why I like this movie people have already said in a better way than I could ever do CHARACTERS\nThanos is the best villain in the entire MCU and a great protagonist.\nWe can understand his goal for wanting to whipe out half of the people In this galaxy and there is alot of sacrifice conflict and sympathy for what he is doing to achieve this goal which makes his motivation more personal.\nHe kills Gamora so that he could succeed in his goal to get an infinity stone and that makes him suffer.\nHis planet got destroyed cause of over population and Gamoras planet became great because of Thanos whipping out half of the people in that planet and that makes us understand Thanos even more.\nIf he could have saved people by killing half of the population in that planet why can't he do the same everywhere else?\nAnd that's what makes his motivation so great. Understandable but flawed.\nHe could have also used his mighty power (I.e. when he gets all the infinity stones) to give resources to people so there was no need to kill of half of the people in the galaxy but because he is a flawed person he dosent see that (and his character gets better in endgame) he is an imperfect character with great development depth and arc and the fact that he won makes the movie even better when you see the last scene of him in his farm. OTHER STUFF\nThe structure was really good and everyone acted in character and I think Peter Quill and Tony stark were the best characters of the heroes who were fighting Thanos.\nPeter Quill being emotional over the conflict of Gamora and that makes him act irrational.\nAnd Tony stark dealing Great consequences for what he has done (and it gets better in endgame) And the action is really amazing specially in the Titan fighting scene were every thing was so well choreographed. this movie is one of the best MCU movies. VERDICT\nThis movie is really good.", "Infinity war is a high-paced masterpiece that combines so many interesting characters in a unique way. I am truly impressed by the way the directors have brought things together and have built up the culmination for the whole MCU since 2008. Visuals are phenomenal, funny moments are plenty. Despite the relatively smaller focus on character development, I liked that you can clearly see the motivation for the actions of each side. This brings more depth to the story and brings the viewer on a emontional ride. Infitiy war is full of twists and suprises, and is never boring.

So they will all say 'too many heroes', 'how come they didn't do this or that', 'Thanos had four of the Stones on titan, how could they have almost taken the gauntlet from him'. OK, OK, OK.... First up, Thanos didn't know the full extent of the power of the stones coz he hasn't used them before. So it was all new to him. Everytime he used the stones to FIGHT, it was hardly a calculated effort, it was always reactionary. The element of surprise is what the Avengers used against Thanos, so at first he would attempt to fight without using the stones until he decides to use them. If you think the plot is shallow you might want to watch from the first movie (Ironman 2008) to understand the emotions, behavior, temperament & power of these heroes & villains.

The Wakkanda sequence is action packed, energized, tense, and every character has a moment to shine. 4. Gamora is SO MUCH MORE DEVELOPED! They took an ok character, to one of the highlights of the film! Some great acting comes from Zoe in this movie! A Few Complaints: 1. Thor's subplot is incredibly BOOORING! Think how cool it would have been to shoot lightning like in Ragnarock, but they take a step back and give him another hammer. 2. It doesn't feel like an Avengers film!

It moves along constanly and not a minute is wasted. You are never bored and your mind is constantly racing trying to piece everything together. Thanos is both charismatic and yet very frightening. The acting from Josh Brolin is phenomenal and the motion-capture is actually flawless. The battles are engaging and large, yet they still feel small and down to earth, which gives the film a very nice feel and style.

Was really looking forward to it, maybe that was the reason it took so long, finding the appropriate mood and day to check it out in 4k on my tv.\nFinally I managed to watch IW a few days earlier and it went by rather fast and felt to be an unfinished movie, like it should be. But it felt to be lackluster too and also highly inconsistent in terms of writing. Like how the movie starts and how it progresses regarding the villain's actions. Like his personality is shifting based on the part of the movie, being overly violent, then dismissive later on. I sympathize with Thanos' character but the movie clearly wants to make him an indisputable evil lots of the time, however I look at it, and wanting you to understand him at other times, which just feels highly inconsistent once again. In addition all the new tech/powers associated with either side are breaching into the territory of 'anything goes' leaving lots of plot holes and leaning into convenient writing. There are no rules anymore, the story dictates what happens to whom which breaks the suspension of disbelief a bit. Lots of stuff is going on here, and the disjointed nature really shines throughout. There are too many people perhaps featured in this film. It might feel rushed but it definitely cannot leave enough space for development. The humour felt rather tacked-on in a lot of cases. Like almost every scene has to include a few jokes at least. It felt tiresome by the third one.\nOverall, without going into further rumbling, I can tell that I enjoyed IW but felt nothing especially special towards the end. The whole movie feels so unimportant and it heavily goes overboard with some (supposedly temporarily) actions. I liked Avengers much more with its more grounded approach and these huge risks, like the fate of the universe are really outdated at the moment and just make for dull movies overall.", "I just wanted to write a review on a film that will forever remain so special to me maybe mostly because of today....for we have lost a man who started this franchise from the beginning: Stan Lee. Stan Lee had a vision, to create characters that could entertain young and old worldwide and give a sense of hope to the world. Over the years his characters came to life on screen from Iron Man, Spiderman, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk and many more. They all served a purpose in their own stories and yet they all connected where this film comes to place. A film that translated them ALL together in one to stop maybe one of the strongest villains around. Now I don't want to say any spoilers to this film, but I will say that seeing all these characters in one film was amazing. Each one stayed true to their characters and you could feel the excitement when each one took their scenes. For everyone who ever loved a superhero and see them work together...THIS FILM HAS THAT! And it's all because of Stan Lee and his passion for them all. I thank him for his imprint on this world and how I can look back on this film and see that he left this earth where all his mightest heroes came together to make an exceptional adventure and memories to never forget.", "The best MCU movie to date, not afraid to make bold decisions, wonderfully written story, fantastic action, all round spectacular!", "Curious about Avenger 4 untitled movie. Love Iron man and amazing Thenos", "This is a very emotional movie for some people. Spider-Man is my favourite superhero, so it was very hard to see him go. Also with Thor having felt as if he had failed all the avengers. This was a very good movie.", "All super heroes in one screen! Lucky us. \ud83d\udc9b Story is poetic.", "Best of the best. Thanos shows that he is truly the best villain in the entire MCU. Character interactions are hilarious! Scenery is beautiful and story is great! A couple scenes where the CGI was lacking and the plot got a little confusing. Filled with sadness as we watch some really OG Marvel characters die like Loki, and watch as newer characters die as well, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and Star-Lord.", "Mind blowing! No words to talk about this movie\nEvery second is entertain for me. I sit on the seat like dummie NO MOVEMENT.\nMarvel now adding some fun in movies i like that. Now just wating for avengers 4", "Awesome movie and all I can say is that I didn't want the end to actually be the end...I wished there was more...it left me wanting for more...I cannot wait for a sequel!", "This movie is a movie that brings in many emotions and is worth watching, as I have seen it twice myself. Definitely worth the watch, especially if you're a veteran of the Marvel series.", "This thing is incredible\nI loved every thing about the movie\nAnd,spoiler alert,the ending is nice and \"different\"", "Juat all round great film I also like the guardians and thor combination and the guardians plus iron man, spiderman and Dr strange.

However even if it was fun and pretty much enjoyable I didn't really get into it and the problem here is the fact I am not that into the Marvel universe and this movie felt like a sequel to every standalone Marvel film that came out last year so I felt like I was missing on something, and couldn't fully connect to the story it was like starting to harry potters saga with the 4th movie, you'll enjoy the action but you won't feel passion and compassion to the characters. and this is the case with every Marvel movie I've seen so far.", "This Is One Of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen And, Also, One Of The Best Superhero Movies I've Ever Seen. This Is One Of My Favourite Movies Of All Time. However, I Think Avengers 4 Which Is Going To Release On 3 May 2019 May Snatch Away The Title Of My Favourite Movie All Time From Infinity War. I Am Telling Everyone That Dont Trust The People Who Say It Is A Trash Movie And Gave It A Rating Between 1-7. Because, It Is Such A Good Movie That It Deserves A Rating Of At Least 8.5", "Where to even begin with Avengers Infinity War... This is BY FAR the best Marvel film and up there with one of the very best films to grace a cinema screen...my only regret with this film...Not seeing it in IMAX!! The whole lead up to this film (and Avengers 4) has been a rollercoaster ride, and the way the Russo Brothers bring all the superheroes together is brilliant and they do a fantastic job of giving each hero their own moment to shine!! The special effects are magnificent, the story is really well done, and THANOS...easiily one of the greatest movie villains, Josh Brolin did a fantastic job, totally badass and you actually felt like his main goal which was to balance the universe actually had a decent motive to proceed with his aim...And in some scenes you actually felt sorry for him (the Gamora scene in particular)  I have to say tho my personal favourite scene from this film has to be Thor's entrance on Wakanda, that gave me absolute goosebumps...easily the best entrance in the MCU!!  This film literally had everything from start to finish and if you're a true Marvel fan and Comic fan then this film is definitely for you!! JOB WELL DONE MARVEL, JOB WELL DONE!!!", "They did it! So much characters brought into one very big movie and it is structured and very fun to watch. \nThis is how it should be done. Well done Russo's!", "In every way an achievement. A culmination of a decade of comic book splendour flawless in its execution. In every way a triumph.  If it takes 35 minutes for Cinema Wins to get through a movie it must be something special.  Infinity War is 2h29m of perfect pacing, wonderful action, funny interplay, jaw-dropping set-pieces, perfectly pitched character arcs, an amazing balance of the huge cast, acting that never puts a foot wrong.... Endlessly rewatchable, it could be said that Infinity War was under more pressure than any sequel ever to deliver, but that baton is now passed to 2019's Avengers film, as how do you follow something this....infinitely great.  Top 5 Ever\nJaws\nBack To The Future\nThe Shawshank Redemption\nPredator\nDie Hard", "Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I've rated this one a solid '9' against a pair of '7's' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that \"If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist\".  Fresh on the heels of \"Thor:Ragnarok\", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit's, er..., Rocket's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians.  Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos's minions. There's also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene. Once again, and I can't help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: \"What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?\" And oh yes, don't want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there's a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn't in the path of the New York City dust up.", "Wow! Yes, there were my feelings after watching \"Avengers: Infinity War\". Seriously, I was shocking! In a good way. For me Avengers was funny action with stupid story. Sorry, fans. I didn't read comics or watch cartoons or anything else. And when you didn't expect anything interesting, but you got it -it's a big deal!  Thanos is our President! This is interesting, but first time I like a main villain. Thanos is a main pillar of the movie, the center of the story. He is interesting villain - and he has a dream... (or a plan).\n \nAnd because Thanos occupies centerpiece timing you start to like him. He has a character and different feelings (maybe somewhere deep inside). Unlike some other villains. And he is very charismatic person. In one word - Thanos is our president! Why he is so deep character - I don't know. Maybe because of Thanos in comics, or maybe this is coincidence.  Other heroes Well... and there are we have a problem. I didn't read the comics, so, I didn't recognize some heroes. When fans were shock from heroes (look! Look! This is ... unintelligible... OMG!!!), I was like \"Who the heck are you?!\". But this characters didn't have a lot of time, so I was thinking everytime \"Yup. Goodbye, my nameless friend\". Is this a problem? No. This can heat up your interest to this story (and you will turn in this inexplicable fan) or... whatever, this isn't spoil the movie.  The main heroes of the movie are Ironman, Thor, Doctor Strange and... the Guardians (particularly, Gamora with Peter Quill). Captain America is very washy compared to other characters and Black Panther has only episodic role.  But all this pile of heroes showing interesting confrontation with Thanos. Yes, there are many questions about Thanos logic, but, we all need a happy end? Sorry, story Yes, about logic. The plot is good enough for such movie. Not very logical, neither detective. Simple story with several plot twists.  If you wouldn't thinking very much, you can enjoy. Besides, Thanos, judging by actions, kind of honest humanist! He has his word and thinking about some \"ideal world\".  So, this was unexpected, but I'd like the movie! And if you are fan of the fantasy (with some elements of fairytale) - must see! 8 Infinity Gems / 10", "Liked the content. The graphics are really very good.", "The lives upto the exception, superb direction, eagerly waiting for the second part", "World-shaking events are kid stuff in \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" the first installment of a two-part sequel to \"The Avengers\" and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" The whole universe is under attack from Thanos, an infinitely villainous villain sporting a multicleft, prognathous chin. Universe-shaking throwdowns succeed one another with truly stupefying regularity as the Avengers and their Guardians of the Galaxy allies take turns rising to the challenge. But moments that touch the heart are few and far between in this almost-culmination of a decade of Marvel Comics movies. The finale, scheduled for release in May 2019, may well bring the adventure to fittingly grand fruition. What's on screen now, however, is table-setting for events to come, a groaning board of superheroes, a superabundance of undifferentiated superpowers, and an ending that's more exciting than anything that precedes it.", "Most of the MCU movies are buidling to this point. The movie focuses on the 'infinitiy stones' which earlier Marvel movies are often based off and which form the overal narrative in the MCU. Which for 'dumb superhero movies' is actually kind of cool.  It isn't an funny as Thor, and doesn't have the same ethical issues as Black Panther or even Captain America. A bit more sterotypical good vs evil. However the population control villian ethics are better than most other movies. Obviously a part 1 of 2. Things dont' go well for the good guys, setting up an epic but dark movie overall. I enjoyed watching it - gave it 7/10 since it's mostly typical pg13 cgi superhero fight scenes without the extra plot. but the epicness of everything coming together, as well as the somewhat bold move to end the movie on such a dark note/loss, with the usual comedy/easter eggs that make mcu always a bit fun, earns it a solid good/average rating!", "Out of this world...Can't complain its a must see.", "This is actually the best Avengers Movie i've ever watched, until now Captain America 3 was on the top of my \"favorite marvel movies\" but now Infinity War is on the top.

The Russo Brothers have done a tremendous job with Avengers Infinity War. it starts off where Thor Ragnarok left off with the big ship which happens to be Thanos' and it keeps you guessing and guessing and begging for more. In the end of the movie you see Thanos snap his fingers with all six Infinity Stones and a lot of people die or so it seems. It keeps you guessing whether or not Thanos is trying to do the right thing by eradicating half the universe. My theory for Avengers 4 is that since they are in the end game, as Doctor Strange calls it, I think that the people who supposedly died are inside the Soul Stone and I believe that Doctor Strange has a plan to get everybody out of the Soul Stone using Ant-Man and the quantum Realm.", "Crikey, this film went on for ever thus making it a tad dull.

Can't wait for the sequel.", "Watching all of my favourites coming together on the big screen is exciting as hell.\nEverytime I saw another hero link up with another I was giggling like a kid. \nSeriously good movie and time travels way to slowly waiting for these movies to come to fruition, where's Dr Strange when you need him?", "This movie is like heaven to superhero fans...... Thats it", "I watched it opening night and again a few weeks afterwards, and I thought it was a great movie. I think the Russo Brothers are perhaps the best directors in the MCU so far. (An argument could be made for Ryan Coogler and it would be completely justified.) The Russo's have directed some of my favorite Marvel film to date, such as Captain America: Winter Solider and Civil War. With that in mind, I had very high expectations for this film.  This is the first time there are real stakes at hand in the MCU. Actions have severe consequences, and nothing is off limits. Everything you've come to expect from 17 films over the course of 10 years are thrown out the window as new rules are being formed -- there's no safety net here. This is what we've been building up to.  Let's talk about the real star of the movie: Thanos. This is undoubtedly Thanos's movie, and he isn't wasting any time proving how powerful he is. Everything from the opening scene, \"Let him have his fun,\" to the battle on Titan. He dominates in every scene. Before Erik Killmonger in Black Panther, Marvel has struggled with producing a villain we care about. Erik was a complex character with a lot of pain and anguish and feeling of betrayal, yet his principals were grounded and heavily influenced by his environment. Thanos is very similar in this regard. Truthfully, it's very hard to talk about the movie in any capacity without spoiling some major details. It's best to go in blind and just enjoy the ride. But I can tell you that this is one of my favorite Marvel movies to date. If you've been following the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the past ten years, then this is a must-watch. Actually, just watch it regardless. You won't be disappointed.", "I have not had a huge vested interest in all of the Marvel movies that lead up to this big one but I have seen them all. However I did enjoy the last Thor film and I was suprised how much I liked the last Guardians of the Galaxy film. So that's where I am in all this, I'm not the biggest Marvel fan and can't remember half of what has happened in the last 18 movies but I like elements of them a lot and I do tend to watch them all on bluray release dates.  Infinity War however just sucked me in. I didn't think it was over saturated by the quantity of Characters, somehow it just worked. Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy were introduced in to the story well and although I'm not the biggest Marvel fan I knew what was happening the whole of the time. This is the biggest thing that Marvel has ever done and they weren't afraid to take risks. I also feel that raising the humour level like they are is the right thing to do.  This film ends like no other super hero film has ever ended. When it first ended I felt sad that there wasn't more but after 2 and a half hours surely if I felt like I wanted more then this means that it really did suck me in, I could have easily sat there for another 2 hours to see some sort of closure.  So now I can't wait for the 4th Avenger movie, I have never waited in anticipation for a Marvel film like it before. In the mean time, I may actually go back and rewatch the other Marvel films which I didn't think I would ever do again.", "From Sci fi action to more natural action sequences, humor at the most intense moments, avengers makes it better than the previous ones in the series.

It's different from the comics, but in a good way, story fits this specific universe, and Thanos, in my opinion, is much more complex and interesting character than who got to meet in the comics. Visuals are well done, music is thrilling, especially at the end, crossovers are done in a great way, everything fits and connects the way it should.", "Avengers: Infinity War, in my opinion, is the best movie in the Avengers universe. I was never a huge Marvel fan, I always enjoyed watching any Avengers film, but I was COMPLETELY and UTTERLY blown away after seeing Avengers: Infinity War. There's only a small list of movies that have taken my breath away after seeing them, and Infinity War is definitely one of them. From the incredible cast and character list, to the memorizing special effects, Avengers: Infinity War does not shy away from moments that make you rethink everything you have known about the Marvel Universe. One of my favorite parts about Avengers: Infinity War is the score, it really helped tie in the special effects in addition to the story-line, which contained both dramatic and comical scenes. The one thing you need to know is that the ending will truly, mess. you. up. Even if you are not a fan of the Avengers and you see this movie, you will still feel shocked. I definitely recommend seeing Avengers: Infinity War.", "I could not be more dissapointed with the plot, the endless supply of \"super heroes\", and the constant explanations about other MCU movies you might not have seen.

Standing in his way, however, are not only the Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth) but also their intergalactic counterparts Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper). Striking a perfect balance between action and emotion, this third entry in the franchise is the culmination of Marvel Studios first decade of filmmaking and it offers up a myriad of shocks and surprises, including an earthshattering ending.

The various characters play their roles nicely throughout the movie, with ample screentime for almost all of them. A nice accomplishment, considering how many different characters are actually making an appearance. The pacing felt exactly right to me and even though the movie speeds along rather quickly and there really isn't any character development to speak of beyond what we already know from previous movies, it never felt rushed. We are not working towards something anymore, we are nearing the end. The action scenes are done very well, emphasizing each character's powers and abilities nicely and quite in detail, with plenty of originality in showing it to us. And the CGI? They outdid themselves; top notch and then some. No messy \"big CGI explosion showoff\" lazyness here. With Thanos as a villain, we (finally) have a real villain. Well acted and far from one-dimensional. I'm glad this time around there wasn't an overabundance of unfunny jokes being crammed into every possible scene. Still, not all the jokes/humor landed for me, which continues to turn certain characters into caricatures of themselves. All in all, not flawless, but nitpicking at this point would be nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking. For what it's supposed to be, this movie did almost everything right. And most importantly: it was an entertaining ride from start to finish. 9/10", "Nice cast\nNice plot\nClever way of bringing the heroes together\nExcellent villain\nGood pacing\nExtremely good action scenes\n~Spectacular ending~", "This was one of Marvel's better offerings. It has some great scenes, and some cringeworthy ones.  There's a great scene where they team up and try to restrain Thanos. The racoon is hilarious. The axe-forging sequence was great. Zoe Saldana's scenes are hard to watch. Mark Ruffalo is very annoying. I don't think he should be in these movies, or at least they should give him better lines and better direction. Chris Pratt is annoying as always. Most of the movie involves battles where a hero is close to being killed, then gets rescued at the last moment by another hero. This happens throughout the film. I didn't like Josh Brolin as Thanos. Memorable villains are extremely rare. This one had potential but I would have used a more emotive actor. Lastly: where is the Army and the police, while Earth is being invaded by aliens. They are nowhere to be seen =/", "It's impossible not to merit Infinity War, the fact that a movie could have this many characters and stay coherant is admirable, and the effects and actors are phenominal throughout - I truly believed I was seeing these heroes fight in these otherworldy locations.  The best parts of the movie are when the characters are just talking to each other - the wit and the charm still shines through in a movie this jam packed.  On the other hand, the action is forgettable and boring, and basically pointless. There's no tension - you as an audience member know that the avengers aren't going to defeat thanos in a fight, so why is so much of the run time devoted to character after character punch him? The final battle is the typical avengers noise fest where you know none of the characters are in danger and nothing of note is going to happen.  As a result, Infinity War fails to get me invested or interested, there's no emotional core to the movie so everything is just noise. The ending is predictable, what will happen in the hopefully better and more focused next movie is predictable, objectively you have to give the movie credit for managing to stay coherant but in the end most of it fell flat to me. Packed with boring action, writing shortcuts, inconsistencies, emotional moments that fall flat because the film is so desperate to move onto the next plot point, and pushing some of the best characters to the side, I won't be revisiting this one any time soon.", "Thanos got the stones very easy!!!!!. I will concentrate on the time stone. Dr strange should have used his time powers and try a few times taking the glove out of thanos hand, save stark before thanos was ready to kill him etc.. and then instead of going back in time he gave the stone to thanos just like that..", "I was so super excited to see this and being a lover of marvel movies in general, I feel it held true for most of the marvel characters. Loved the continuation guardians of the galaxy and their own brand of sarcastic humor as my favorite of the marvel series so far. I was completely oh my WTF just happened when the movie ended in a cliffhanger but I feel for this story it's necessary to tell the whole story. The plot comes together with past movies and we begin to see the bigger picture that will follow, and we will be dying in anticipation for! So yes can't wait for more and totally disregard the one-two stars I've been seeing!", "It's fast paced, exciting, and fresh. But, it falls back onto some Marvel movie cliches. Is it the best Marvel movie? I don't know, sometimes big franchises can resort to one aspect of their movies to always fall back on and in Avengers: Infinity War it became very clear. The constant one line witty remarks can drag it down and sometimes have no place. On the other hand, this movie gave three dimensions to a lot of characters. It added more to Tom Holland's Spider-Man and developed Thanos masterfully. Some people may complain that some characters did not receive enough screen time and that's true, but this is the comic book mashup movie the fans have been waiting for. I will add that some characters were poorly developed like Star Lord and Banner, but I really can't fully give my honest opinion until Avengers 4 is released. This movie was a giant cliffhanger which will either seem epic and dull by Avengers 4's answer.", "This is a big movie, a really big movie. Pretty much every Marvel character in the universe pulled in to a giant, drawn out fight for the fate of the universe. The production values are of course excellent but somehow I just felt it was a bit overwhelming, another fight, another explosion, another Marvel character, by the time it finally finished I was a bit beyond caring. It would have made a clever final chapter for the avengers but suprise, suprise I see there is another Avengers movie coming next year so I guess it is really just another super-hero movie.", "So it's finnally here, and was really worth the wait. So let's dive into it. All the acting was pretty solid and good but was never weak. The main reason I gave this movie a 7 instead of a 6 is because of how well it handeled it's sub plots so well. I looked at how little each character actually got on screen. It really didn't feel like that in movie. That put aside let's talk about the plot overall. The plot was pretty good and I felt it was well paced. There really felt like there was a reason to worry for these characters and I felt true suspense. Thanos motivations are pretty good until you think about it to much. It really tears the movie down when you do, so it was a bit forgiving to let it slide and keep this a 7/10 instead of a 6/10. Overall it was a really good time and I really enjoyed myself watching it. I suggest it to any McU fan and anyone looking for good natured action and suspense.

No matter how much expectations you have for this one, it surpasses it with aplomb. This is Marvel's most entertaining, action packed, and at the same time impactful movie till date. The Russo brothers have surpassed thier own Civil war, which for me was the previous best. All those who are complaining that there's just action no character development, I may want to remind you, most of the character previously featured in movies where there characters were etched out well. Here the focus is rightly on Thanos. Josh Brolin makes the mad titan one of the most memorable movie villians of recent times. Kudos to Russo brothers by adding a emotional angle to him as well, conveyed through his relation with Gamora. The ending is a huge cliffhanger, and leaves you shocked.

The fight scene was very forgettable until i saw the film twice which is just unfortunate. the films action scene was on spot. its almost the definition of awesome. at the last fight scene, i thought for sure that thor would kill Thanos and vision would only die because, well, this is a marvel movie. but nope! every one just evaporated which was mind blowing and heart breaking. especially spider mans death was super sad. his dialogue expressing him desperately not wanting to die shows him that hes still young and even heroes risking their lives are still afraid of death. because i didnt see the comics of marvel, i dont know the future of marvel, i think this film was a fascinating way to finish the marvel series.", "It is a very Nice movie but when thanos snaps his fingers Some deaths are very sad. The most sad death sc\u00e8ne is spider-man's death sc\u00e8ne and thuis sc\u00e8ne could be very hard to watch i still almost gonna cry when i think and talk About it so watch out behoren seeing this scene", "The Russo Brothers have showed that they can go beyond the comic book movie genre and they've done it again. Despite the great moments it has, Avengers: Infinity War isn't a perfect film, as much as I would like it to be. The action was cool; it was a big showcase of all the different fighting styles throughout the battles. The fact that there are just so many characters in this film hinders the possibility of each character really showing off their skills. For example, Captain America was shown to have new shields in the trailers so I was looking forward to seeing him use them to fight off the alien army but it barely happens. There is always time spent to show off Tony Stark's new tech though, and seeing him fight with them was fun as they are always so inventive with Iron Man's abilities. The MCU has always had trouble with creating and defining a villain along with their motives. So many of them are forgettable and seem dull and uninspired even though they come from their own source material. Thanos is the exception though, if there is one baddie in the MCU that anyone will remember, it's clearly going to be this guy. He had a lot more screen time than I was expecting. Much of the good that comes out of the Thanos character is also brought in by Josh Brolin, giving many great performances and having a great voice for a big villain. James Spader's motion capture in Avengers: Age of Ultron wasn't bad in my eyes but the way they did it for Brolin's Thanos in this film was much better. It seemed more natural; the facial expressions never looked weird and were actually pretty clear. I almost forgot Thanos wasn't alone though, as he also had The Black Order on his side. Unfortunately these allies were somewhat forgettable; the roles they play are very sparse and I don't actually remember their names ever being said at any point in the movie. I myself only knew who they were because I had done research on them a while ago so I can only imagine how the more casual enjoyers of the MCU films felt when they saw these secondary villains pop up seemingly out of nowhere. Like many other people, I've seen the previous MCU films so I already know the main characters. In this case I was just anticipating some fun interactions with different characters and seeing them team up. One of my favorites came from the dynamic between Tony Stark and Stephen Strange. They're similar in various ways and seeing them finally be in each other's presences was interesting to watch. It also helps that RDJ and Benedict Cucumber are great actors themselves and help make the interactions as fun and/or serious as they are. I was saddened to see how little Steve Rogers and T'challa were used in this film, since they should be a part of the Avengers's frontline. I feel like the filmmakers didn't know just how successful 'Black Panther' was going to be or else we probably would have seen him more throughout Avengers: Infinity War. Sure, Wakanda is an important setting for the film's overall story but the major characters from there just aren't used as much. Tom Holland's Spider-Man is always a joy to watch, as well as Dave Bautista's Drax with his dry humor. As we've seen from Thor: Raganarok, Chris Hemsworth is more than capable in pulling off the humorous side in Thor but I was much more pleased seeing him in battle. I'm also a big fan of Elizabeth Olsen so I was happy to see she'd pretty much lost the Sokovian accent and also just looked great in and out of costume. I also want to mention that I did not like the way the filmmakers handled Gamora in this movie. The music in Avengers: Infinity War is interesting, and not in a good way. There's a YouTube video entitled \"The Marvel Symphonic Universe\" that details the use of orchestral scores in MCU films. The point of the video was to say that a lot of the music put in to these movies can sound so generic and very forgettable. It's not so different in this case, I probably won't be dying to listen to the film's soundtrack anytime soon. Some people have mentioned that this along with the fact that a portion of Avengers: Infinity War takes place in space makes it feel like Star Wars, in terms of being a type of space opera. This aspect can take away a bit from the overall atmosphere for those people, especially if they're are very familiar with John Williams's scores. I'm definitely a bit partial to the MCU films, as they provided me with a lot of fun moments in the past years. However, as fun as they are, their prolific nature in the film industry can be concerning. Disney and Marvel are constantly growing in size and stature with these movies and it has no doubt had an effect on Hollywood in its attempts to create more cinematic universes and big blockbusters. The culture of making entirely original and meaningful films that don't pander to the audience's expectations is not as prevalent anymore and that is due to companies such as Disney and Marvel. It's hard to keep expectations reasonable for a movie like this; there is a lot on the line and so much has been done to achieve this state in the MCU. For the most part, Avengers: Infinity War delivers on many things especially in producing some cheers and gasps from the audience. I've never once cried during a movie but I felt a little something happening in my tear glands during the final 10 minutes. Was the six years worth the wait? Considering everything that happened and the fact that the dust hasn't even settled yet, I'd say it was.", "When you watching the movie, time past very fast but there are a lot of script errors.", "The Avenger and their allies must use all the power they have got in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos who tries to wipe out half of the life in the galaxy. This is a long-awaited movie to be released by Marvel after they released many movies to introduce many characters associated with the film. Avenger Infinity War has over 20 main characters in total. They can do this because the background of each character has been described in their own movie, so when the movie starts, they can suddenly jump into the conflict without an introduction of the characters.  The production of this movie is absolutely fantastic, all stunts, actions, audios, and computer graphics are the best. There are a lot of things going on during 2 and a half hours period, the screen time distribution probably the most difficult part to deal with in my opinion. It came out OK but can be improved.  Moreover, this is one of the hero movies that the storyline is very hard to predict, making it recognizable and hard to forget. Although the movie answered the main question, it also makes up more questions at the end, make the audience demand for the next Avenger movie.", "I loved this movie! Having seen ALL of the Marvel movies leading up to this, I found it exciting, funny in all the right moments and also sad. It kept me entertained the whole time and when it was over I wanted more..that's the definition of a good movie. Those who said they were lost or didn't understand or it didn't have a good plot line...wtf? Are you sure you were watching Infinity Wars? Go back and watch the other Avengers, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor..etc..if you need to understand more of the story line", "Its all been leading to this! Avengers Infinity War brings together the last 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe! The Avengers, Black Panther, Doctor Strange Spider-Man and The Guardians Of The Galaxy come together to defeat the mad titan Thanos in an attempt to stop him from retrieving all six infinity stones. The ending will leave you confused, emotional but also very excited for the future of the MCU. However the fact that Ant-Man and Hawkeye do not appear in this film left me a bit disappointed as Ant-Man (2015) was a big part of the past 10 years as it introduced a new hero and I think to see him not make an appearance was wrong. Hawkeye was one of the original 6 Avengers so it would have been right for him to show up. In conclusion, the movie blows you away and takes straight into the centre of war as the film begins. You will love it!", "Don't be intimidated by its length. Dive into the story and you won't be disappointed (unless you don't like cliffhangers). In one of the final sequences, there is little to no music; allowing you to interpret the intense, raw emotion.", "Excellent way to develop the most epic battle of the Avengers, has many details in its favor and meets many expectations for fans", "Let's start this review by saying Infinity War is a good movie. The problem is it's just not a great movie. It feels like all the Marvel movies lately have been at that great level, and in the case of Black Panther, in that rare spot above great. Yes, there is a definite dip in quality in this movie, but it feels like a much greater dip due to how amazing the studio has been lately. As for why this movie wasn't as good as the rest, well my main problem is that it ends up feeling a bit overstuffed. There are way too many characters to keep track of, and you end up losing track of them. It ends up feeling like you're waiting for your favorite character to show up, and every second they are off screen, you are not as interested in the film. Also, I feel the end does have a major problem. Not what happens and the decisions that were made but the fact that it is simply unsatisfying. This is the movie we've waited for 2 years to see, the movie with all of these actors, all this hype. Not to mention, we have to wait another year for the next movie, with the way this film ends, one can't help feeling it could have delivered a slightly more complete-feeling film. However, there is still a lot of good stuff in this movie. For one, the as-promised dark-drama theme of this movie is ever-present and makes the movie feel like no other Marvel film. You probably are skeptical this kind of genre would work for a Marvel film, but as soon as you hear the voiceover in the opening credits, you know that despite whatever you feel about your Marvel films, the Russo Brothers have done a damn good job making a dark one. Also a lot of the characters hold a lot of value. The best by a clear mile in my opinion is Thor. He has come from being the goofy, hard-to-take-serious hero to being the hardened, hell-bent god that he is made out to be. Thor, in this movie, is one of the most badass superheroes ever, if not the most. Also, Thanos, despite being the villain is a clear highlight of this film. First we had Killmonger, now Thanos, it seems the MCU villain effect is wearing off. Josh Brolin gives an excellent CGI performance kin to Andy Serkis' Caesar or Gollum, not to mention the character development for him is incredible. An especially high point is his relationship with Gamora, which is beyond what we could have hoped. It is extremely emotionally strong. Those two are the definite highlights in term of characters, but there are plenty other great characters. Doctor Strange has several mystical-action scenes, some better than what we saw in his title film. Teen Groot surprisingly has a strong character arc. The only character I disliked was Star-Lord who not only makes out-of-character decisions but feels like he is either mad or confused the entire movie and fails to show much else. His character arc also feels pointless as it fails to resolve any conflicts with the character. All in all, Infinity War delivers a strong sequel, it just has a few flaws, which is not something I can say for the previous 6 MCU films.", "Entertaining and well produced but there's so much going on with so many characters that it doesn't connect as much as it possibly could have.....that being said this was great fun.\nNot a great film but certainly good enough", "Thanos: This next move though, The next move, will be some hot asf fire Thanos right after: snappity snap. Snappily snap, snap, de snap de snap. No, but seriously, this movie is great. Just don't get mad at the movie ending like me and others did.", "Absolutely incredible and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. There's a few minor things about it that one could pick a fight about, but that can be easily over-sighted by how much of a fun time you're having watching it unfold. Also to note, is we have finally strayed from the Marvel Movie formula, and it feels amazing. Brush up on your Marvel films, and then watch this bad boy with some popcorn to be entertained.", "Simply Good!  \"Sorry, your review is too short.\" - Heh! What you want more to know? Movie is good. Dont want to spoiler so only this. Deserve 10 , gave him 10 stars , but here 9 , because even best movies can always be better.", "The movie was good. The hopes and expectations might be fullfilled. But feel like the movie could've been bit longer, so it could not fall into the messy montage alignment. That was the bit of bitter tinge for me.\nAlthough the minus, the movie is a grand adventure.\nThat's all from me.", "SPOILER: These is many things what can be said about this movie, and most of them are good, so why not talk about obvious stuff everybody keep forgetting.\n1) This movie demands you to see all previous marvel movies since 2008. If you missed at least one of them, then you will enjoy this movies quite less. This movie only spends time on developing only one single character (the bad guy), because all previous characters were developed on previous movies.\n2) \"Fans\" kept demanding quality villains and actual reasons behind their motivation. The last villain these \"fans\" were satisfied with was Loki back from 2012. So, Marvel just done that - they worked on creating a villain with actual personality, story and motivations. Yet, these same \"fans\" are now complaining about Marvel doing what they demanded Marvel to do.\n3) Marvel is subscribing to left wing (cancer) ideologies of diversity (code for anti-white anti-male bigotry) and progressive stacking of victimhood (the biggest \"victim\" is always right). For this reason alone you can bet your life on the fact that Marvel will never ever kill off female or black super hero in one of their movies. Even if one of these character \"dies\", then it will be brought back to life in the next movie.\n4) Ending of this movie (it being the first part of two parts) left a opening for the next avenger movie which will follow events directly after this one. However, keeping in mind points 2 and 3 in mind, the next movie most likely will be extremely predictable (lets face, this one was extremely predictable as well). Overall, i have seen all previous Marvel movies, so i enjoyed this one as well (even after the dumpster fire of Black Panther). But i only enjoyed this one because i have seen all previous movies. If you have seen all previous movies and you also wanted actually quality villain, then you most likely enjoy this movie as well.", "I went into the cinema expecting a move that i would talk about for weeks... it turns out that it's a movie that i will be talking about for months!! \nA great film and would recommend to anyone Marvel fan or not!", "After watching twice on the movie theater, I'm obsessed! This is movie is incredibly beautiful/chaotic/funny\nIt shows basically the reality that we're already living..... \ngreat expectations for the next", "When i went to see this movie i was really scared , you know the hype ruins alot of stuff for us , you go in to the movie expecting alot and you be really afraid you'll be disappointed. Fortunately , This wasn't the case with Avengers Infinity war . The movie was two and a half hours long , but i really couldn't feel the time , it passed like minutes or less . i enjoyed every minute of it , i thought every fight and every character and every story was well placed . i was afraid of being overwhelmed by all the characters being put in one movie , but i thought each one of them did his/her part without affecting the others parts as well.\nThanos is By far my favorite Marvel villain , he's not a villain because he wants to be one , no , he has a vision , a bad corrupted one , but he has it a he'll do anything to make it happen . he really is a good villain . I loved the comedy in the film , i loved that it wasn't too much , they weren't trying hard to make us laugh . the jokes were good and didn't take away the seriousness of the movie . Shout out to the father-son-like relationship between SpiderMan And IronMan . I Just love them !! Overall , great movie , worth watching more than once . you'll enjoy every second of it . I don't know if you can still enjoy it if you didn't watch all previous MCU movies , i personally recommend you watch them before watching this.", "Four stars are just the beginning if I can count how many moments I have thought about \"Avengers: Infinity War\" throughout my day, how about how many tears I've cried if I were the crying type or how long it took me to catch my breath. How about how long my heart stopped but if there is one thing you can count on is an Avengers movie to be awe-inspiring and how hard it's been to keep my mouth shut other than one word, Wow. I can honestly say for one moment that I was utterly bereft of hope to see something like this, and I wanted the movie to be longer because I couldn't believe it, and yes this is a superhero movie, but still, I expected I don't know. As far as the cast goes, I can't single out one single character because they were all so incredible, how all their movies meshed into that of the greater Marvel universe and I still can't believe people walk out at any sign of the credits I mean it's a MARVEL movie people. This film will leave you utterly speechless. Now with the appeasement of Fandango, what the holy hell was that; I will be the first one to *sigh* the usual endings of this type of thing, and I should warn you now there will be spoilers near the end of my review. Usually, I tend to ramble, and I think Marvel tends to stretch their movies, but this is probably the second movie I sincerely wished was longer next to Black Panther because with Infinity War it's like no this can't happen when it's all over. Let me also say that besides the ending that will undoubtedly draw more people, I think Marvel are some geniuses when they again put Black Panther as the last movie before this; I'm surprised there isn't more noise considering, to be honest. The comic fans though must be feeling pretty smug in their superiority, Marvel has me I'll admit and yes without a doubt I will see the next movie, but I won't be buying the comics anytime soon, strange since I try to read books before watching films. Here you are reading my thoughts on the subject though; anybody (there's a tumbleweed) well how long has Thanos been working towards his plan, my perspective is over with a finger snap perhaps. In the spirit of full transparency, I've not seen every single Marvel movie, my list of reasons spanning from, I think Natalie Portman is hot, or I like seeing heroes fight each other, and one of my favorites, I'm an African-American man. So instead of listening every single film that I have seen let's focus on this one, stop me if you heard this, bad guy wants to do bad things, and a group of superheroes that aren't exactly friends must stop him somehow, someway. How to blend so many different storylines, there are sure to be a few misses, not that it takes from the movie at all but they don't go unnoticed and tying everything into a cute bow is incredibly impressive. Visually and maybe I'm jaded by this point, but it wasn't the most beautiful place, but you're mesmerized in the world and everybody I suppose drifts to their favorites heroes which is again a hit and miss with me. Of course, we get the Stan Lee cameo, which is one of those things that I can't honestly comment on seeing as how I'm not this comic book fanatic but something that I look forward to considerably. As far as villains go, always you have to do your research since they can be as replaceable as villain A, B, and C, along with an army of henchmen or let's say cannon fodder. Honestly, we all just wanted one big fight right. You'll get that sure enough and Thanos for me I was a lot more impressed with his mindset than his imposing figure, seeing as how I am a fan of The Purge Franchise no doubt which can be a scary thought. Comedy-wise, the jokes hit their mark though there was one moment in particular that made me cringe and no it wasn't the ending but will get to that one misstep. Think of Avengers: Infinity War as a more colorful and happy \"Watchmen\" with a more significant body count, Marvel vs. DC can't say I have ever chosen a side but if we count the movies I've seen, I like Batman but sorry DC. Avengers: Infinity War is different from its other films by the fact that you want to learn about this world and everything in it. As in most of the flicks, you have a moral question, but they gave me a book so that I could understand the Infinity Gauntlet, I want it. If we're going by the Fandango scale I'll give it four out of five stars, yes I know I'm hard to please, and I become upset over the dumbest things, but the fact that this movie didn't have me looking at my watch is saying something. How about saying this, don't look any further than here, this movie won me over, I'd see it again, I would buy it, I'll see the next one but enough time has passed so yes spoiler alert, just saying. The moment that made me cringe and yes this was so freaking dumb for me to care about is when they arrive at Wakanda and Bruce Banner is wondering whether or not to bow to King T'Challa, and he does. So yeah it's a bit of an awkward moment, can't stand stupidity for stupidity's sake. Then we have Thanos and minions, can you say Darkside, more comic book wars or what have you; Thanos's plan, is excellent and the fact that you might be able to see a bit where he's coming from I believe. How about the fact that some major cities have bared the brunt of evil and suddenly Wakanda is being asked to throw everything into this, to me, it's a bit unfair but whatever gets fans. As for the moments that got me to geek out, must I say this with every review, yes because I don't like to lie or omit and in this day and age men are being taught saying anything will get you in trouble? *Ahem* I adore the ladies, in particular, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow and where's Valkyrie? The battles always get me but I wanted to see more of what the Infinity Gauntlet could do before Thanos went for the main course, and I wished the fight was even more detailed, I mean not just the heroes. Spider-Man and not the end but that moment Tony Stark knighted him somewhat into the Avengers and of course the ending that I never saw coming at all; who is Captain Marvel? I'm hoping I won't end up like Annie Wilkes seeing all the sequels that will be coming out to explain all that has happened; I'm somewhat surprised there wasn't more of an outcry except against Star-Lord. No use crying about it now since you can see if Thanos got to you \"didthanoskill.me\" but I doubt any of us will be gong long, until 2019 but How Long Is Infinity Avengers.", "This was a great movie for the fact that you forgot your troubles for 2.5 hours and could watch some awesome heroes and villains clash in an epic war! I'll break it down as follows! Reasons it was cool:\nVisually pleasing and smooth CGI (minus Bruce Banner's head in the hulk iron man suit [WTF?]) Thanos looked good though! Great mesh of the different characters (Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy). I enjoyed the emphasis on Thanos as his story is quite interesting; naturally a stand-alone movie would be nice.  This movie raised the stakes! Maybe our heroes AREN'T as immortal as we thought?  Reasons it was not cool: Criminal underuse and screen time for some of the cooler Marvel characters like Dr. Strange, Captain America, and Black Panther. I get that it is an ensemble film on steroids, but felt shortchanged with regards to them in particular. \nThanos seemed overpowered at times, not allowing for enough actual war or conflict The ending (will not spoil) loses some of its impact when you realize the other Marvel movies coming out.", "Despite some slow pacing and a confusing storyline, Avengers Infinity War is the culmination of years of MCU movies and their interlocking storylines, resulting in a movie that features the main villian Thanos killing half of the MCU heroes that have driven the franchise to record heights. Among them, Black Panther, Spiderman, Gamora, and in a post credits sequence, Nick Fury and Maria Hill, calling for Captain Marvel, who will make her screen debut next year in an origin story before she joins the team in Avengers 4, also slated for next year. The way the film was shot made the characters a bit bigger, and the music and sound is amazing. You will cry when the movie is over, so bring some tissues. It is the darkest of the MCU movies, even darker than Thor the Dark World and Captain America Civil War combined.\nUpdate: The home media release lacks the imax ratio seen in theatres and is the more common scope version. I Hope disney replaces the digital release with the imax release just in time for endgame although it's more of an imax issue than disney. BTW, if you have netflix, then this movie is one of two marvel movies that will be the last ever to stream there, as disney+ will have captain marvel as the first marvel movie to stream there.", "I still do not understand why this movie is no longer called \"Infinity War: Part 1\". Frankly, it isn't an Avengers movie. It seems more like a Thanos movie. I grew up reading Marvel and DC comics, and seeing Thanos without his usual garb is almost like watching Andy Serkis behaving like a monkey in a green room with dots all over his face. Surprisingly enough though, it just works. The Thanos we are exposed to isn't the Mad Titan from the comics, but Pink ball of CGI muscles that looks and sounds a lot like Cable. It is the Pink ball of CGI that cares very much for his short green, dagger-wielding child. Talking about Gamora, I don't think we will ever come to terms with how she was portrayed in the movie. Why is she CRYING so much? James Gunn, could you please switch that up, mate? The Avengers have a lot of teary as well as cringe-worthy moments throughout the movie. I am still trying to come to terms with the fact that the once amazing Pepper Potts is now just a whiny girlfriend who cares a great deal about Tony's safety. The Guardians are the only ones who are definitely off their natural game. Every scene with Dave Bautista is brilliant, in that he's definitely the only out of his natural skin into one with sensitive nipples. It doesn't take Strange's magic or Hawkeye's vision to figure out that Chris Pratt is back to being a fat dude. The only two characters in this movie that I truly adored were Thor and Peter Parker (Spider-Man). I really hoped that I would do better than 50% with the predictions. The movie does fall short on two major aspects:\n1. The distinct CGI - Seriously, if you tell me that Proxima's face was natural, I will fight you.\n2. The law of a play - This law mandates that each story moves over three acts. Infinity War ends in Act 2. The only true work of genius I see in this movie is in how they handled the introductions of the 20 odd superheroes. For example, Thor being introduced to the guardians, Banner embarrassing Tony in front of the Wizard, and Drax asking \"why is Gamora\". P.S. I am not a big fan of Marvel's casting efforts, especially with them having cast a feminazi to play one of the most iconic female superheroes in their roster. I mean, it only takes a tiny scroll through her Twitter handle to put a sour taste in your mouth about the upcoming Captain Marvel movie.", "The world is on fire...the stakes have never been higher...it all comes down to this; ten years in the making, the stage has been set for Marvel's gritty, somber, epic-scale collaboration, as a powerful intergalactic despot sets his sights on collecting all six Infinity Stones in order to \"fulfill his destiny\" and rebalance the universe as he sees fit. Old grudges will have to be put aside, egos will have to be kept in check, and unlikely alliances will have to be formed as all of the world's heroes (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Star Lord, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, et al) must band together to take on an adversary unlike any they've ever encountered before. This intense, sprawling, multi-character saga has the requisite amount of witty humor and relentless, edge of your seat action, but pushes far beyond the boundaries of the comic book world and emerges as an ambitious, allegorical, and often heartbreaking spectacle of heroism and sacrifice that will resonate with viewers long after the film is over. Goes on for a long time, but seeing ten years' worth of MCU characters united for a colossal front is more than enough to compensate. Brolin makes Thanos a compelling, multilayered, and somewhat tragic villain who is sure to be remembered for years to come; a solid outing for non-fans, and a sure-fire hit for dedicated followers. ***\u00bd", "There is so much that you can say about this film. The problem is, that would mean I would have to include spoilers, and I don't want to do that. Although, I'm sure many people have seen the memes before watching it, like myself, but even I was surprised by some parts. Anyway, here I go.  The day before watching Infinity War, I watched the first Marvel movie ever made: Iron Man. I wanted to see the amount of changed between the first movie with the nineteenth in the series. First, Iron Man alone is a great film, but you can still notice the problems. When watching Infinity War, it is like a work of art. Every camera captures the emotions of every character, and we even see character depth in Thanos (will not say where in film because that would be a huge spoiler for anyone who has not seen the film). It brings back everything from the movies in the past, from Civil War, Winter Soldier, The Avengers, Age of Ultron, and multiple others.  In other words, watch the film. There is nothing I see wrong with it, and the end will most likely make you tear up.", "...you probably should avoid movies based on comic books. Fun summer blockbuster...now you got it. Ignore the trolls with the 1/10's and the 10/10's from the fan boys and you are left with a good flick. For me the pace was good and it didn't feel overly long. CGI was throughout(as expected) without being the star of the movie. Decent storyline and plot and very well scripted. Amusing in spots...a bit dark in spots. Plenty of star power in this one and marvel continues the humanizing of heroes that it invented(the humanizing that is) back in the 60's.  Short review, but ultimately it comes down to I recommend the theatre for this one and don't regret spending the cash even a bit.", "Comedy, action, emotional... this movie had it all enough said.", "A fantasy movie is maybe the easiest movie to end up OK, but maybe the hardest to make magnificent. And they did exactly that. They deserve the 9/10", "To start, I found the film to be entertaining. I personally don't go into super hero movies looking for something utterly profound or with a snob mentality. I take it for what it is. Marvel has set up its universe as one the whole family can watch and as such comes a level of predictably at times. Infinity War is another chapter in a long living super hero genre that follows a certain criteria, and that's what I expected going in. Other reviews trekked mud all over the movie saying it had no character development, it is too long, it is not long enough, there was no story/plot, they expected more, they didn't get the hype. The funny thing is while they cringed at whoever rated the film as a 9 or 10, they equally pulled a crazy and rated it a dead 1 out of 10. A drastic 1 rating means this film is completely unwatchable, which I didn't find to be the case at all. Yes, I agree there could have been more done to the film to really polish it, but overall I enjoyed it. It is exactly a Marvel film. Going in hoping for a Sundance, super dark, drastic change in style isn't going to happen. To expect more would be pure insanity because for Marvel, the formula works. Is it going to peeve some comic book nerds and those with their nose held to the ceiling in hyped-up high expectations? Oh yeah.  I have watched every Marvel film up to this culmative point so this brings me to the major point: you have to go in having seen the prior films. It all leads to this movie ten years in the making. It is ten years of character development, ten years of story and plot, ten years of Thanos--and Marvel--building up for this endgame moment where life is not always fair. In Infinity War, the 10-year-movie-in-making finally hits it's climax so it really isn't a shocker when there is nothing but fighting and a fast-paced direction as it all comes crumbling down. There is no more waiting, no more time for long chit-chat banter or backstory and introductions of who is who and why. It's Thanos. He's here. It's all about him now and how to stop him. Knowing this, watch the film with an open mind, for the sake of entertainment. Also, look at it as a final, much longer end credit scene before the next Avengers because it will leave you greedily wanting the next installment. (Side note: there is an added plus if you have seen all 18 previous films during its time because unfortunately, some films have become dated in style.)", "I can reveal my answer to the title of the review directly here and now: I don't know. Infinity War is a grand scale movie - and I usually don't like that. I don't think, that the \"end of the world\" should be taken lightly in a movie (if it is not a \"end-of-the-world-movie\"). I have to say, while it is not as \"apparent felt\" as in other super-hero movies, the \"scaling of the individual powers\" are ridiculous. Captain America can hold back the hand of Thanos, who can even \"pull a moon\" with his powers? Yeah - right. Thor is as strong, that he can move a neutron star? But isn't able to even successfully fight one of the generals of Thanos? WTF. These are the details, which souring my \"super-hero experience\". Superheroes are based on science fiction - and when the science becomes pathetic the movie (for me) falls apart. However... Infinity War as movie is so well crafted and there are so many different scenes, which are all happening parallel - yet fit together so well, that you don't have time to think much about the \"scaling\". The consistent progression of the movie just keeps you on the edge of your seat and it becomes never boring or annoying.  Let's talk about the big guy: Thanos. He is brilliant. Honestly, he is portrayed very well - and the success of the movie is due to his set up. His agenda is comprehendible... killing randomly half of the (intelligent?) lifeforms of the galaxy to ensure a balance? In a way it makes sense. Especially because he has accept a personal loss to gain the ability to let half of the galaxy perish...\nIt has been a long time, that a movie super villain has had such a grand agenda, which has been portrait in a way, that you could understand his/her motivation. I loved it. I would have loved to get a bit more exposition of the generals of Thanos. But I guess, you cannot get it all... At the end, it is a good movie. Unlike Deadpool 2, it isn't an example of a movie, in which other movies in future should progress. While the formula works in Infinity War, the chances are, that the same formula would cripple other movies. But for the time being, I have to admit, that I really enjoyed the movie, the suspense - even the ending (spoilers: Thanos get his will).  Unfortunately for the genre and for the \"main-Marvel-universe\", Infinity War is poison. Every character has basically \"god-like\" abilities, which makes no more sense. Unfortunately you also cannot turn the time back (at least not with the portrayed powers). Hence it seems that the Marvel universe is a dying star, which is not in its hottest state.  My final verdict is: enjoy it - the success and fun won't last...", "Considering it's a superheroes movie, it stands as one of the best.", "Let me start off by saying I thought the movie was good over all. The plot was more complex than that of most Marvel films, the intersections of the Avengers storyline with Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy being well-done.\nThe movie had the obligatory Marvel comic relief, but also left plenty of room for tragic moments. The ending was not at all what I expected and is a nice departure from everything-is-undone-in-the-last-20-minutes that many superhero movies feature. The dialogue was witty and for the most part well-written, and the special effects were unbelievably good.\nMy only complaint with this movie is with the pacing. I realize it is supposed to be the big battle Thor Ragnarok (as well as Age of Ultron and Blcak Panther had been leading up to) but the back-to-back action sequences sometimes left me thinking the movie had too little plot spread across too great a time span.\nI nonetheless enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone remotely into Marvel.", "I suppose now is as good a time as any to give my impressions of 'Avengers Infinity War'. I've never been a huge fan of the MCU but that isn't to say I hate it. The MCU definitely has made some films that rank among the best of the comic book genre and then they've made movies like 'Iron Man 2' and 'Thor The Dark World' where I'd rather watch an all day Zach Snyder film fest. And so I am kind of in the audience that wants something from this and yet won't go too easy on it. I liked it. This was a huge gamble as it has been hinted at for a decade but for the most part the movie delivers on it's promises. The stipulation being that the movie will only work if you have seen the entire Marvel catalogue good, bad and downright ugly and have had some level of appreciation. If you are on board the movie immediately becomes a giant set piece that really stretches the confines of what has been done before.  Josh Brolin makes the film. He gives in my opinion arguably the best performance in a MCU film. So much depends on Thanos and for a film that doesn't really have enough room for any extraneous sequences Brolin is able to develop an intriguing character who makes this cartoony McGuffin based evil plan have just a bit more nuance and weight. The scenes with Brolin and Zoe Saldana have an intimacy and tragedy that you really don't expect in a film with this breakneck speed. I don't want to spoil this but the shocks have to be reevaluated next year when the sequel comes out. I'm willing to do that however as the setup here warrants interest and belief in the possibilities of the next episode. In a way 'Infinity War' is kind of a victim of the MCU being an undying franchise. We all know the reset button is going to be pressed and it's just a matter of the pressing being as interesting as the thrills here.", "(Disclaimer: For my last two reviews on Black Panther and Ready Player One, I forgot to mention that both movies also had amazing set pieces. I apologize for that error in my reviews which do not mention set pieces). It is finally here folks.  The movie that most people have been waiting for like crazy ever since it was announced has finally came out. And, instead of getting caught up in all of the backstories and becoming a bad movie. It turned out to be a really good movie! The story for Avengers: Infinity War is quite standard: Guy wants to destroy half the life in the universe, Avengers have to stop him blah blah blah. But while the story doesn't offer any new concepts for the MCU, it does so some pretty coo stuff. First off, the story obviously kills off a decent amount of beloved heroes. Which, due to the gravity of the films and characters, is a pretty tough decision to make, so the story does leave some emotional impact for some people who had to see their favorite hero killed off. The story is also very suspenseful; the entire film and the twist ending (which is executed perfectly) keeps the audience on the edges of their seats. The story also delves into the players and backstories a little less then other films in the MCU. Instead, the movie focuses on the characters and how they respond with just how important is at hand. You get to see how each character does under the pressure, which is sort of cool to watch. Pretty much every important character in the MCU is featured in this movie (except Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nick Fury for some reason), and every actor and actress playing these characters plays their character to the max! Everybody, from Chris Evans to Tom Holland. So naturally, the performances are pushed to the max! Which means, that the PERFORMANCES WERE AWESOME! Josh Brolin also shines as Thanos, the main villain. Not only is he the brutal villain that fans have been clamoring for, but he also is a sort of soft person on the inside which makes him even more terrifying. The special effects and set pieces are beyond spectacular, no need to go deep into that. And the action sequences are lengthy, but that is a necessary inclusion in order to make them feel like something. Also, they are constant and mind-blowing, which is good. The fast humor is also still here, regardless of the movie's mood, the characters still manage to impossibly crack jokes. There don't seem to be any morals, but that is because the movie wants to focus more on storytelling than teaching. The character development is good, as well as the epic orchestral soundtrack. Though the one tiny problem that this film has is that it doesn't really delve into any of the characters backstories which could make it confusing for newcomers. Though the thing about this is that there probably won't be many. The film is also directed and produced with expertise by the Russo brothers and Kevin Feige and Jon Favreau. The bottom line is- This film is so amazing its godlike, it's not at all like and better then Justice League, and you should see it if you haven't yet. 'Nuff said.", "This is a well made Marvel superhero comic book movie.  \nYou may stumble upon many reviews saying that this movie is Marvel's magnum opus, a comic book movie masterpiece that asks questions, brings up new and interesting ideas and stuff, but it's not.  \nIt is written much better than most of Marvel's stuff, yet this type of movie has its limits, mostly because it is made to appeal to the widest possible audience. This means that some of the core elements have to be dumbed-down to be more understandable and simple. Thus all the drama parts are very simplistic in order to be easier to process by younger audiences. I hoped that this movie would have been a little heavier but it's not. \nThis fact also affects the dialogue, most of which is either a failed attempt at humor (yet the \"target\" audience, younger kids, seemed to be enjoying every joke in the theater), or an attempt to overexplain the simplistic plot, or some really weird pop culture reference younger audiences won't be able to understand anyway. Thus, most of the talking parts were a pain to sit through with rare exceptions. There was one good joke set up by War Machine in Wakanda though. \nThe action was great, even though at times it was hard to understand what was going on. From time to time the superheroes even use their abilities in a clever way. CGI was mostly good too and some of the environments they created were pleasing to the eye, especially the Vormir part, neat art direction. Kudos to all 3000 of CGI artists and studios that made this movie. One of the weakest technical parts was the soundtrack, the tracks were forgettable and not fitting at times.  \nPlotwise the movie was extremely predictable, furthermore, the events of the second part are also easy to predict. I don't want to spoil anything, but a change of heart is what we are going to see. \nA well made movie that, while being probably the most emotion-packed of Marvel movies, is still unable to provide you with that feel or emotion when you leave the theater changed at heart.", "SPOILER: This movie was great. I loved it. Thanis was everything i wanted.  The saddest scene was when spider man died. Black panther dies as well. So does the guardians.", "I couldn't believe I saw some 1 star reviews on this film. Apparently they don't appreciate the time and effort that was put in this film. The film was very well put together, great chemistry between characters, some great humorous banter between characters and had some great action sequences. The acting was also well done and especially with Thanos and certain emotional scenes through out the movie. The ending is a little unexpected, yet we know there is a part two. What actually makes this film better than the other films is there are consequential stakes and sacrifice in this film which made if more intense. I really enjoyed all the characters in this movie, yet all are different and have gone through different struggles and some the same. The most thing I enjoyed about this film is how they went back and forth to different characters to allow each one to have their moment. Was this a perfect movie...No..but Marvel delivered an intense film epic film worth the price of admission.", "This film is fun, funny, dramatic, and serious. this film is one of the best films of the mcu.", "It had its funny moments and its emotional moment, but it also had that same sense of being overstuffed that I felt in Age of Ultron. Especially during that battle in Wakanda, I felt like falling asleep, because the action just got boring. Another big battle with 20+ heroes being given a 3-second-long one-scene-wonder against a huge army of CGI-generated mooks. Honestly, I felt that the entire Team Cap storyline was the weakest part of this movie. They should've ditched Captain America, Bucky, Black Widow, Falcon and Rhodey like they did Hawkeye and Antman; their absence would've made little difference, and the time wasted on these one-note characters could've instead been used to better flesh out the background that led Thanos to come to his conclusion to wipe out half the universe and also Thanos and Nebula's relationship. Like, why is she treated so differently compared to Gamora? Most enjoyable moments were Bruce returning and giving Tony a hug, quips between Dr. Strange and Iron Man, and the interaction between Iron Man and Spiderman. Scenes of the Guardians meeting the Avengers was also great to see.", "I don't normally write in IMDb but this time it's worth it. The movie is everything it should be! No character development?! What exactly as being done in the past 10 years??! Predictable? Wtf? I'm 32 years old and father of two and still screamed like a teenager when Tony takes the blow from Thanos. For fans of The MCU and even fans from the comics ( yes, because a movie doesn't need to copy paste the comic to be good and respect the characters) this is the best MCU movie.  You have the right to be full of the cinematography array of hero movies but don't blame this one for your lack of other earthly occupations in life.  This was the first time I've been to the movies in 4 years and this movie blowed my mind. But that's because my mind can still be blowned... \nget a life, plant a tree, go for jogging and come back in a year to talk about The Avengers 4... let's see what happens! Farewell, live long and prosper.", "We've long been heading here and it is finally here! The infinity war begins with a bang leaving you no time to adjust in your seats. You are immediately transported to Asgard and you see Thor and Loki at their most vulnerable. Thanos is on a mission for the stones. The beginning for some reason reminded me so much of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Ummm... you'll know why when you watch the movie or you'll get my cryptic clue right here. Then you are in New York and you see Hulk and Bruce Banner battle between themselves in what could only be a superhero midlife crisis that keeps us laughing throughout the movie. Doctor Strange and Wong are now informed by Hulk about Thanos coming to Earth and BAM! We have Amazing Spider man, Tony Stark, Doctor Strange, Wong, Bruce wannabe hulk get into a battle with Maw and Obsidian. Next thing you know we are in Scotland with Wanda and Vision. Things seem to slow just for a minute and KAPOW! Midnight and Glaive ambush the couple, only to have the Falcon and Black Widow rescue them. Then we are in SPACE and who do we meet here? The Guardians of the Galaxy, who are attending to a distress call, find themselves in the company of Thor. They briefly exchange pleasantries and then Thor is off to Nedavellir with the Rabbit and Groot. While the rest head to Knowhere. At Knowhere, Thanos and Gamora come face to face and well they face off and face smash like people do in all superhero comics. Gender no bar. You thought we were done travelling through the universe didn't you? Nah ah! We then head to Wakanda and the war that ensues there reminded me so much of the LOTR scene where Legolas and the rest are shooting arrows at the Wargs. Does Thanos get the infinity stones? Will the Heroes live? Is everything lost? Well maybe not because comics always leave you with that glimmer of hope in the bleakest situations. The movie was done well. There is a lot happening the entire time. There is comic relief and some really serious moments. Every MCU character has screen-time. Don't complain about how little it is though! I love fast paced movies. I love a theme. I love how everything comes together and falls into place. We have been heading here since 2008 and we know every character there is and we know what to expect but can we handle it? The movie has been directed well. The background score is also on point with the story. The CGI is amazing. I especially loved it in two scenes a LOT! One is the war at Wakanda and the other shall not be mentioned because *spoilers*.  The teenager in you will rejoice. You will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat.

Only that can bring out complete enjoyment of this movie.", "On May 3, the popular saga about Avengers, excellent popcorn movie for viewer each categories was out in Russian theatres. In contrast to other installations of that franchise, I liked that everything was well-balanced. Drama, comedy with good humor, action scenes are in the right proportion. That is not simply a time-killer like always.\nThe plot is simple and standard. We have heroes and an antagonist with a superiority complex, who make is evil with good intentions. Yes, we have seen it in a hundred times before, but this time it was executed superbly. The difficult task is to take all heroes and put them into one movie, that's not a mixer, where everything mixes by itself. We saw a similar effort with Civil War. I think directors managed to do it this time. \nThe cast worked seemlessly, that looked good. Stan Lee's cameo stands out, he is always gorgeous, but the role of a bus driver with a funny replica looks better than always.\nI can't say anything about the picture and effects, because I love more smooth films, without a lot of effects, but it looks good in my non-professional eyes. I liked that directors took a lot of locations to switch concentration from scene to scene. That increased the duration of the movie, but ensured that non scene is too loaded with action. Music perfectly fitted every location and was different for each.\nIt is absolutely a seven out of ten, the movie is too long, but the realistic ending satisfies. The battle is lost, but not war.", "Pure insanity, action packed and funny, my favourite marvel film the only downside is most people die but it's obvious they all are resurrected in part 2 with the time stone. Also I was really pissed off when lockey died but a stunning turn of events !", "The wait was to long for this move to come out now I have to wait another year to see how they get all those heros back. A must see for any action fan.", "First of I'd like to say I did liked the movie, it was better than I expected it to be, and for the amount of characters they were very well handled for the most part. The problem is Marvel in general, they have managed to do a giant TV series, some episodes are good, some are straight up bad, but they keep you hooked and basically force you to watch all the movies to enjoy this one, you see, this movie will not age well, simply because as a stand alone, it is not a good movie, people defending it has a plot, no it does not, the plot is the entire marvel universe, but the movie has very little and at times inconsistent plot, as an example how come Vision was probably THE most powerful avenger in Civil War having the mind stone and all and in this movie is a complete rookie who needs saving by a simply enhanced human, but I wont get into much detail on the inconsistencies, the movie works because its fan base are blind to what a good movie should be when it comes to marvel, granted Marvel is not meant to be a Dark Knight Trilogy, its made to entertain more simple minded audience and as I said it is enjoyable to watch, but only if you watched everything else and you shut your brain a little bit to not get annoyed by the inconsistencies and lack of plot or good script. The other thing I wish would have impacted me more (SPOILER) are the deaths, I felt nothing from anyone dying in this movie, and before you say Im just stone cold hearted it's not because of that, Marley and me did made me cry for example, the problem was that none of the deaths feel permanent, not even Gamora which was the saddest death anyway, but I believe she is simply trapped in the soulstone and they can still get her back somehow for guardians of the galaxy 3, thats the other thing, you see all these movies planned with characters that are supposedly dead it's hard to believe they are really gone for good, Marvel has become famous for never actually killing its characters or rarely and only when they dont serve any purpose, compare any of them to the death of Rachel on TDK, that death alone had more impact than all these deaths combined With all that said, it was certainly an enjoyable movie, just not as much as people claim it is, this movie deserves an 8 at most but probably a 7.5 would be a better fit, 5 being an okay movie you did not hate but forgot you even saw, 10 being masterpiece 7.5 is good and memorable but no close to a masterpiece", "I love Avengers infinity war movie but in this part i missed so many charectcrs including nick fury and many others.\nactually I hate (Spider-man) instead i want to seen x-mean. or dead pol.\nand that part of Avengers no one capable to beat thanos.\nso stan lee have must hire some new characters.", "Loved it. What makes this film is the combination of so many characters that we know but they don't know each other. It was awesome to see these people meet for the first time and see how they reacted to each other.  It's witty and does well to give each character decent screen time. Thank you Marvel", "Firstly, I really appreciate the effort put into the film. They did a great job in bringing the infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Every superhero got their fair share of screen time. They increased the stakes by killing a number of key characters at the end! But I will say the movie was more about the villain Thanos than the heroes.. so it was missing that typical Marvel touch. All in all, I liked the movie. But I enjoyed some of the previous Marvel movies more.", "Nice CGIs but none of the characters were able to show their full power and movie ended. this movies seemed dejavu. 9/11 standing in front of two towrz and infinity war, what's the connections!!!", "First of all: I found A:IW to be entertaining. It's worth the watch let alone for the comedy and the fight scenes. Now the bad: it tries to be a lot of things at once: a comedy, a drama and an apocalyptic action movie - and it fails to properly deliver any one of those. It achieves to be a comedy in parts, especially the Guardians' scenes are VERY funny (at least if you like their WTF-humour). \nThe dramatic part, unfortunately, falls flat. Thanos has a lot of potential to be a tragic character, but his background story, motivation and character traits are given barely a handful of scenes. I think 'generic' is not the correct word for him, but he's also definitely not a deep character.\nThe action is ok, actually very much the stuff you would expect. Apocalyptic or epic atmosphere is missing - people on earth simply don't seem to care a lot about Thanos' invasion. Also, the fights of Avengers and their allies versus Thanos' forces takes place on a very small scale - you will see what I mean.\nPersonally, I also didn't like the joking around and the 'cool' attitude of the heroes in the face of universal extinction, it just was another atmosphere killer to me. It should have been either all comedy or all serious. Oh and I loved the ending! So calm and peaceful, yet so significant and brutally uncompromising. I hope they don't just revert it in the sequel (and it's aaaaall marshmallows again) :-/  That might sound very harsh, but the bottom line is: A:IW is an entertaining action spectacle. 7 stars: 2 for the action, 2 for the jokes, 2 for the villain with potential, 2 for the artistic ending, 1 for the timetravel-multiple-realities-story, -1 for the nonexistent epicness and -1 for the story arc with the dwarf (completely wasted screentime).", "All of the marvel movies lead to this epic movie.

Avengers Infinity War is now the biggest movie of all time with an opening for the weekend of April 27th 2018 around the world of $680 million dollars and raising each day. The Avengers assemble to take on the big purple bully Thanos who wants the 6 infinity stones for his infinity guanlet to control the universe.   The film is pretty simple to understand and I'll try to explain it without giving away spoliers and believe me I want to tell you guys what happened but I won't. I promise I will with all my power to not say any spoliers but it'll be hard. But anyway the film is about the Avengers Iron Man, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Widow etc assemble to take on Thanos who wants these stones to be the greatest villian in the universe. Now this film has been 10 years in the making and the reason I say this is because if you haven't watched the other films that feature infinity stones you'll basically be lost. No offense but why would you watch a movie like Infinity War without watching the other films. You'll be confused and out of sorts if you did, it's silly but hey that's just me I like to watch films in general so I've already seen the other Marvel films that the stones were in so I knew what where they were but if you haven't watch the films, shame on you, but I'll help you in the quest for the Infinity Stones.   There are 6 infinity stones that are scattered around the universe and these are the films where they were found. These are not spoliers because they've been discovered already so here we go. The Space Stone is inside the Tesseract in Captain America: The First Avenger which was stolen by Loki and used to attack New York in the first Avengers film. The Reality Stone was located in Thor: The Dark World which was given to The Collector who'll make an appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 for safekeeping. Speaking of Guardians this is where we find The Power stone which was discovered by Peter Quill aka Star Lord which they gave to the Collector for safekeeping at the end of the film. The Mind Stone was seen in Avenger Age of Ultron and is inside Vision forehead where it remains until we see it in Infinity War. The Time Stone is seen in Doctor Strange which is protected by the Doctor at all times. The last stone is called a Soul Stone and we found out where and how Thanos get that gem in Infinity War.   Now the film itself was really entertaining but very emotional and of course I can't speak on that part because that would be spoilers and I don't do spoilers as I have said before. But see this film in the theaters it's worth the price of admission. I will be buying this film when it comes out on blu-ray and I'll pick up some comics to find out what's going to happen next.", "The culmination of a decade worth of planning and preparation that will pay off very well. Continuing in the line of blockbuster movies, Marvel is about to bank in another billion, probably two, and maybe even three with Infinity War. The movie pits the world's great heroes against the universes greatest villain. And it doesn't disappoint.\n There have been many series that have culminated into a crappy finale, mainly looking at you Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies. Avengers didn't fall into the money grab hole and instead continued on their self-titled, and self-filled track to a hit. A key reason is it was able to balance probably the largest, most-expensive, and most famous cast in film history. The support-characters who fight for screen time in this film, are primetime actors who would be the star in any other movie. \n The next thing was the villain and henchmen. They made the evil people evil. At points in the film, I was excited to see Thanos henchmen take on the avengers. Not to see the avengers do damage, but to see just how powerful and skilled these followers are. And on top of this, Thanos was portrayed in a such a way to where, we all understood where he was coming from. He wasn't turned into a DC villain where he is just some evil bad guy we've never heard of coming to destroy the world. Instead, Thanos was a villain that is \"evil\" to the core, in the earthly human sense, but at the same time he is a man of morals and passions that are leading him down his path. He even takes chances and risks and sacrifices to get there. It shows how mass murder isn't easy, even when he has all of the power in the universe. \n At the end of the movie, which really is just a Part one of two. We are left with really their most important goal, and that is anticipation for the movie next year. With a couple of movies separating us from the next sequel, anticipation is building even more. This movie won't be featured in the Oscars, but it will definitely be the movie of the year, and probably the most memorable of the decade. Purely due to the amount of work that has gone into this MCU over the past decade and the success that they have had.", "5/5/18. If there could ever be a \"final\" super-hero movie to end all such movies, then this would have been the one. But we all know that that isn't going to ever happen. The MCU is just too lucrative to ever end, especially when these movies continue to rake in millions. The body count is enormous, but keep in mind no blood was spilled, just dust blowing in the wind, and I didn't see any tears shed because it just isn't so - they will all rise again! Worth catching..", "This is an epic movie when it comes to CGI. Storywise it's just another superhero movie. There are so many plots going on at the same time, so many different main characters and simply false actions taking place that the movie struggles to stay on the road. \nThors powers are back to square one (so why was there a movie called Ragnarok), Thanos sometimes can be hold in place by one avenger even with 4 stones already captured and seriously what was with the ending? Multiple characters that died, already have sequels in the making! So why even try this lame plot twist? Now everyone already knows what's going to happen next. \nOverall the movie certainly was satisfying to watch but it's highly overrated! This is not the holy grail of superhero movies. After the original Avengers this was actually even more disappointing than AoU. At times it felt like watching 3 movies at once. So sometimes less is actually more, which is what they should've done here.", "The word epic is throw around left and right like a bottom text but this movie truly is epic.", "Avengers: Infinity War is one of those rare movies that has an extremely unhappy ending, yet stuns and amazes you all throughout. As Marvel has moved forward with their cinematic universe, and Disney digging their massive claws deeper into the scripts to fill their quota, I was slightly nervous what would become of the Avengers movies, especially after seeing the atrocity that was Thor: Ragnorok. After that debacle I wasn't sure I wanted to continue watching any of the rest of the movies in the MCU. Thankfully Infinity War left me feeling satisfied, even with the cliffhanger ending. The Russo brothers are excellent at their job, and were the perfect choice to bring all the superheroes introduced thus far and make it action packed, dramatic, with just enough humor to keep it from going overkill. \nThe other thing I liked what they did with the movie, is leave a lot of questions unanswered. With the ending of Thanos actually achieving getting all the stones and killing half the world's population, some will probably argue that's a little dissatisfactory (which who can blame them? Half the world basically vaporizes on the spot and 3/4 of the Avengers die as well, while the bad guy wins. That's not exactly the ending everyone expects). But because we know this is only the first half of the act, it leaves fans to come up with their own ideas and theories to what the second act will bring, and try to come up with their own answers to the questions left open. Something to keep us occupied until Avengers 4 is released no doubt.\nLike someone else has said, I believe those who we saw physically die, with their bodies actually laying dead, I'm presuming they are for sure dead. But I don't believe the ones who were vaporized are truly \"dead\", whether they're just in another world that the living can't reach, or there's a way to reverse what Thanos did, I don't think we've said goodbye to all of them just yet, particularly Spider-Man and Black Panther, whom we've only barely been introduced to. \nAll in all, great movie, keeps you guessing, and here's to guessing what the outcome will be come next year!", "At the moment, marvel cinematic universe has 19 movies. Whether you like them or not, they create an important part of modern cinema. These movies bring a huge number of people to cinemas. Some of these movies are incredibly original and creative, some are not. But they all represent a pop culture of the twenty-first century. In the twentieth century, the Avengers were cowboys. An example of real space cowboys are the Guardians of the galaxy. Throughout almost the entire first film, each of the Guardians pursued only personal interests, just like cowboys do in most movies. Or the actions of Spider-Man I associate with Shane from the 1953 movie. Turning to the new film, I want to say that I like Marvel, like their characters, their ability to inspire children. But I also like a good movies and a few of the latest movies of the cinematic universe are disappointed me with a weak script and focusing on visual effects. Infinity War I liked much more. There are a lot of characters in this movie. A lot. Some of them reveal themselves on the new side, they surprise with their abilities. But there is one character, which is more interesting to watch than all the others, his name is Thanos. In each scene where Thanos is present, you can watch his motivation, his rage, his ability to love and kill. From the first minutes viewers are given to understand that this movie will be much darker than all the past, that this movie is not afraid to kill the heroes. Everything that happens in the movie reminds an incredibly expensive theatrical production. The heroes understand that they don't want to die and see the death of those who they love because of the genocide of Thanos. Thanos himself and his hunting for stones resemble Disney and how they buy more and more studios. In conclusion, I just want to quote the dialogue between Thanos and Gamora at the end of the movie.  \"Did you do it?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"What did it cost?\"\n\"Everything.\"", "There shouldn't even be anything under 7 stars for this movie. The people who hate this movie are DC biased or people who just hate superhero movies in general.", "The best comic book movie. Period. See it if for some reason you haven't already.", "The movie was actually spectacular but I wasn't too happy (spoiler alert) that the Hulk got body-slammed in about 2 seconds and the fight was over. Hulk is \"supposed\" to be the most powerful and unstoppable creature in the Marvel Universe. Thanos is supposed to be a ruthless cut-throat villain but shows a \"soft?\" side? WTF? The villains that serveThanos are more evil than he was. That doesn't really add up either. I mean, his motives are evil but his path to them is weak at best. I have to say that the Guardians of the Galaxy are as whacky and funny as ever but when it comes down to it, they get serious and tough. Chris Pratt as Star-Lord was absolutely the best character in the film. Definitely was worth seeing but these movie creators need some \"fan input\" when creating these stories/movies. Maybe next time huh?", "The biggest (in all sense) and definitely the most darkest movie of the Marvel Universe has finally arrived and it has arrived in style just like its antagonist Thanos. Avengers: Infinity War is an ensemble of characters at the highest level. It is a treat for ardent Marvel fans and to the other movie fans it's kind of an emotional jolt.  Unlike most other movies which centers around its protagonists, Infinity War is very much about its antagonist Thanos. The whole movie is an answer to all the bits of Easter eggs that we saw in other Marvel movies until now. Thanos goes around the universe gathering infinity stones to fulfil of his purpose of bringing a 'balance' to the universe while the split up Avengers get back together to stop him. While we get answer to many questions, some other questions start forming in our head. This time the superpowers are much more advanced, the space travel is simpler and quicker. It is very hard connect the dots and analyse them as the movie has an unstoppable and intense screenplay. The humour although much lesser compared to its predecessors, still delivers quality. There are many goosebump worthy moments which in themselves are worth of the ticket price. The only downside for me was watching this in IMAX 3D which didn't make much of a difference at all.  It is very hard to write about individual characters and performances in a movie as big as this. However the mega villain Thanos lives upto the hype of the character. It is also interesting to see the emotional and confused side of the character as well. Josh Brolin with his deep voice suits in every bit. I am a bit skeptical about how other characters get to know each other in a quick team and form a team. It is both entertaining and emotional at the same time to see them together in the big screen.  Avengers: Infinity War is absolutely the biggest Marvel Movie so far and it is anything but over.", "This movie kept me on the edge of my chair ... very intense .. made me feel things which I haven't felt before while watching a movie .. Awesome", "The haters who gives this movie 1/10 is just doing it to bring the rating down. Which is sad, this movie is amazing. Marvel had overdelivered on a complex villain. Just watch it and enjoy! :)", "It is The first avengers movie I like , and can't wait for the next one. I hope they can make it better then this part.", "Paying off a decade's worth of narrative & world-building with an action spectacle of epic proportions, Avengers: Infinity War rewards our 10-years investment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with an enjoyable, entertaining & exhilarating extravaganza that manages to live up to its enormous hype for the most part, if not all, and signs off by setting up a perfect stage for the grand finale.", "Infinity war was a perfectly entertaining summer movie. That is all. Not as good as the original Avengers, or as good as Winter Soldier or Civil war, but certainly better than age of ultron.", "After ten years, 18 movies, and the introduction of over 20 great heroes like the Avengers (which includes Black Panther and Spider-Man), the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Strange, time has come for everyone to get together for the ultimate battle. The end has finally come... and then we'll have more sequels and introductions to more heroes because apparently we live in a country obsessed with sequels and dragging franchises for more money. But seriously the biggest moment for the MCU has come, and it is something. This film just goes to show that the Russos, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely could direct and write a well-balanced story for a movie with 23 heroes and five main villains with about four storylines. It is also shown that they were especially able to make this film be incredibly dark and serious with huge twists yet still keep the humor that has always brought the charm in the series. But keep in mind the huge twists. I will tell you, the ending is a JAW...DROP! As always, the actors and characters we already know are great in the movie. The Avengers (again, includes Black Panther and Spider-Man), the Guardians, and Doctor Strange, have always been great. But for this film, they all have decent chemistry as characters meeting each other for the first time. All the different heroes mix in well together by either driving each other nuts at first, try to work well as teams, and even find ways to develop the perfect match ups. My favorite match ups in this film would be Thor, Rocket, and Teen-Groot, and Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and some of the other Guardians. Josh Brolin perfectly portrays the long awaited alien warlord Thanos as the most ambitious villain in the series who is the right amount of evil, condescending, but also somewhat respectful, and even tortured. His children/henchman, the Black Order are also an interesting bunch, even though we don't see a whole lot of them. However, I will admit that these goons and their boss do a lot of horrendous stuff in this film from beginning to end, which is why it's a little hard not to hate their guts for it all. They're the sorts of film villains you end up both loving and hating. Now...the action scenes tho! They...are...wait for it...PHENOMINAL!!!! All the different heroes fighting together in exotic locations are done in the most ambitious and incredible way in the series. To me, the best parts are this huge battle in Wakanda and a smaller yet just as major and extremely ambitious battle on an alien planet between Iron Man's team and Thanos. This movie is definitely worth the decade (or maybe six year) long wait to see the Avengers take on their worst enemy. It will make you laugh, cry, put you on the edge of your seat, cry, make your jaw drop, cry, want to re-watch it over and over, and cry over and over. I think you get the idea. In fact, it is THE BEST AVENGERS FILM and THE, ... or one of THE... dare I say it... BEST FILMS IN THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE!!! Oh, and P.S.: It'll make you cry. Oh, wait. I said that. It'll make you cry.", "Ah! How much this movie has moved me... 10/10, brilliant, perfect, better than the hype, more than any superhero plot ever! Lets start from the simplest, yet difficult to make authentic thing - humor. I loved every joke, every reference, every cheeky banter! Never has a superhero movie delivered such pure, simple and most of all authentic humor (GotG 2 tried, but failed too often with obviously forced humor). Next, on the polar opposite - the drama. It was really authentic as well, which tugged at my heart sting in exactly the right amount. I definitely shed a tear or two at some moments in the movie. The moment between Bruce and Nat was so real. The last moment between Vision and Wanda was so real. Thor meeting the Guardians, the Guardians meeting the Avengers on Titan, Bruce reuniting with the Avengers... brilliant authentic human moments. NEXT - the action! Of course, plenty of well choreographed, intense action. The massive LotR style battle was so nice. The moment you see Cap outrun the army to spearhead together with TChalla was so AWESOME! The hand to hand combat scenes were very nicely done as well, which is kind of rare these days. And last, but not least, the enormous cherry on top - the villain! I still can't believe how well was this character developed in so little time, remember the movie is only 2hrs and 30 minutes and we didn't know anything about Thanos.\nThe motivation, the background, the execution, the feelings, so nicely displayed through his action and Josh Brolin's amazing acting. And the ending... still can't believe they actually had the courage to do it the way they did and I'm so glad they didn't shy away from a proper ending for this epic odyssey! JUST BRILLIANT!!!", "It was really good. Dr Strange gets flak but that's only from idiots with half a brain. Watch it, it's great.", "Marvel style lots of action, lots of booms and bangs and somebody gets new weapons/ability by the end of the movie.\nThe story is a little poor, 2,5h and there are still questions without answers if you did not saw any other Marvel Movies.", "An amazing theory filled with action packed drama, avengers infinity war definitely nails it when it come to hero movies, and definitely does not fail to disappoint all hero movies", "Best Marvel ever! \nFun and fun-tastic!\nUnexpected and makes curious what's going to happen next.\nDon't miss to watch the end credit scenes.", "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The mighty, evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) is in need of one more 'infinity stone' to place on his giant glove in order to control the universe. In New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is approached by Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his ally Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) in order that they reunite to battle him, and gets treated to a big demonstration of his powers in a massive city battle, during which young buck Peter Parker (Tom Holland) makes his presence known as his Spider-Man alter ego. As the old gang reunite, they cross paths with Skylord (Chris Pratt) and his gang... After an endless stream of singular Marvel universe entries where individual characters have faced their battles and revealed their back stories, directors The Russo Brothers have here decided the next logical step is to create a big, all out spectacle of a film, where the stand alone characters meet up with the Guardians of the Galaxy characters, and combine their powers to take down an epic super villain. It's no doubt something the die hard fans of the series will have been looking forward to, and will have been on the cards for a while given the huge box office takings. But, while it's as big a visual splendour as all the others, in the end it sadly works best only on a superficial level. The central plot is paper thin, and not nearly strong enough to sustain a movie of its length and scope. Not only that, it's also overly reliant on the viewer having an extensive knowledge of all the previous films, rendering it a benign mystery to anyone who's casually chosen to see it. The original Avengers Assemble film (now unbelievably over five years old!) managed to get all the featured characters to gel together well, but this seems over eager to examine all the characters back story and relationships with others, and all together here, there's too much to take in, in a plot that goes nowhere and drags on for far too long. Overlong, overblown and over-ambitious, this will end up over-whelming even the most ardent Marvel fan. It just about manages to succeed by being as colourful and visually exciting as all the rest, with dazzling special effects and thrill a minute action sequences. But this, sadly, is pretty much the best it has to offer. ***", "It deserves a 10 my opinion I love this movies thanos best villain", "Unlike many others, I didn't anxiously await the release of the movie, I wasn't even hyped. However, after the rather high scoring user reviews came in I got curious, as none of the previous movies were nearly this high rated. So I gave it a shot and boy was it worth it.\nThe large cast of characters fit in surprisingly well, though not every character gets the same amount of attention (which is understandable). The action is stunning from a visual perspective and feels quite tight (as it should be). The humor is mostly spot on, probably my favorite of any MCU movie, without undermining the seriousness at all. However, the part which got me really invested is the story and the villain. Thanos has to be one of my favorite super hero movie villains and definitely my favorite one in the MCU. I don't want to spoil anything, so all I will say is that I left the movie with rather strong feelings, certainly more than any super hero movie has ever invoked in me.\nI would highly recommend watching the previous two Avengers movies and maybe Captain America: Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Thor: Ragnarok in advance to get to know the characters and setting of the MCU at the time the movie takes place in but it is still enjoyable without limited or none previous knowledge.\nI am certainly hyped for the sequel.", "I have followed the entire marvel universe from the first captain America movie through the various tv series in chronological order. I even have the entire universe in 1080p in chronological order on a 4 tb portable hard drive. I add the newer movies into the order as they become available. Thanos has always been in the background determined to get the infinity stones. He shows up in guardians 1 for one of them but fails to get it. Here he goes all out and I mean he's all in on his quest here. He's driven beyond measure in this first part of the infinity stone movies. The infinity movies have both been made, just the second one won't be released till 2019 or if marvel decides earlier. I'm hoping for a 2018 Christmas showing before captain marvel shows in 2019. I have seen this one twice in one weekend, first in 3D at IMAX which was well worth it. Actually jumped at a few things flying about. Then again on a high def digital screen. Both were great and highly recommended. Why I gave it a 9 Star rather than a 10 was the joking inference to Jesus which I found very inappropriate and not necessary, a few in the theater grimaced at the comment. Too bad. I'm sure Muslims would have been offended if Mohammad was inferred. Anyway , other than that a fun and enjoyable ride.", "The movie was great, but I didn't feel the same level of excitement or shock as some others did upon exiting the theater. Overall, they did do an excellent job of giving balanced screen time to the many characters who played their part in Thanos' quest for the stones. I have my theory about what will happen in the next film, but I'll reserve giving a thorough review for the sake of spoilers. Bottom line, if you've enjoyed at the Marvel movies so far, you'll enjoy this one. If you haven't seen the majority of the films though the one liners may be lost on you and you may be slightly lost with the many characters and dynamics of their relationships.  Side note: Particularly enjoyed the exploration of the relationship between Gamora and Thanos as well as Gamora and Nebula. I actually wouldn't have minded seeing a film entirely devoted to this back story as well as further exploring The Black Order or Children of Thanos. It would also be awesome to see things entirely from the villains point of view and this film certainly does not make Thanos the typical villain. He truly believes in his cause and the film did a great job of allowing the audience to connect with him on that level.", "Just great enjoyed it. Do definitely recommend watching it once at least", "DESYAT IZ DESYATI OGOSPODI\nBest movie 2018\nBest Marvel movie", "Hype was real. Its even better than I expected.

This film is based on a universe that doesn't exist, and yet it feels so real when the intense moments come. Infinity War is funny, entertaining, thought-provoking, and brilliant. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.", "When i watched the movie i amazed so much ,because the movie was above the\nExpectations , and the movie its not about a superhero things and actions, its mixed with drama and romantic with unexpected storytelling ,and for sure the vfx was prefect job, and marvel changed the mean of superhero movies , thank you marvel for this fantastic magic, alimax22", "...so good! WoW! This movie was good! Very good, to say the least. I sat there in the theatre, chained tro mey seat because it was so very entertaining and exciting. I can safly say that this is the best marvel movie to date! I'm even inclined to say that its better than \"The Guardians\" movies which where my favourites till today. 10/10!  Go watch it, but make sure you watch the other marvel movies from disney before you seee this one, because you might not get what is going on all the time. I recently rewatched all the MCU movies and I must say It helped greatly. There were a lot of people in the theatre who said things like: \"Who was this guy again\" \"Why was he there\" \nThis is the only negative thing I have to say about Infinity war. It might get confusing if you have not senn the other movies. But other than that!

Can't wait for the sequel", "I haven't watched all Marvel movies, but knew enough about the MCU to understand what was going on in the movie, which is very important in order to enjoy this movie. Most characters aren't really introduced in this movie, which makes it hard to feel any bond to those characters from just this movie.  Thanos is the villain and even though he is the villain, you will find yourself sympathizing with him in certain moments. He is directly introduced as a powerful enemy and proceeds to get stronger as his collection of stones grows. However, his continuously increasing power isn't necessarily shown by his fights. In one moment Thanos can turn people into whatever he wants and win a fight in seconds, but after gaining an additional stone, which should make him even more powerful, he loses this ability for the sake of a fight - a mostly very enjoyable fight. In the final minutes of the movie Thanos remembers how to use his stones again and proceeds to complete dominate the rest of the Avengers and finally half of the MCU. At first the ending seemed rushed, but from my perspective now, it feels like a typical happy ending, but from Thanos point of view. It was a good movie, that suffered from inconsistency in some situations and a few symptoms of a slight idiot plot. The action was great, the effects were great and the humor, is not quite my taste, but it was well received by others in the audience. I'm certain everyone who enjoyed most of the MCU movies will be very satisfied.", "If these are truly to be the last 2 Avenger movies, then the Russo bros have saved the best for last. For me, this movie is on par with The Dark Knight when it comes to the villain, the magnificent story telling throughout and the epic climax at the end. Well done sirs!", "I was worried before watching it because I thought I had expected too much but it absolutely didn't let me down.", "This movie is the best MCU movie by far. Thanos in this movie was amazing, easily the best villain I've seen in a movie (up there with darth vadar). The story is amazing and if you have watched all the MCU movies prior then you will have no problem in understanding every part of this movie. This movie is more than just an action/superhero movie, it is a really emotional rollercoaster with twists and shocks. Without spoiling anything, this movie will leave you shocked and craving to see what happens next for the avengers and Thanos.", "Great movie, but ending a bit of a cheat since we know that they'll survive in the next avengers.", "I just saw the movie two days ago. First I thought how could possible that Russo brothers could merged this number of heroes in one movie. The story and script is incredibly amazing. The rnd scene was quite impressive same as all Marvel Movies. I can't wait until i see the next part of this adventure next year. I thanx the director, producers and all cast who participate in this movie. One more thing. I don't think so the story of the avengers will end with part 2 of infinity war. There more to come. This thought stick to my mind few months ago.", "Climax is quick one. awesome build up for thanos. waiting for the 2nd part", "See this as soon as possible if you care enough to read reviews. This movies impact is in your unpreparedness!!! \nThe Interstellar of comic book movies. \nIt moves fast. It tackles enormous plot points, throws all the heroes into the storyline with thrust yet with finesse and comedic touch. 5 story lines converge and collapse into 4, then 3, then 2, boiling over into an intense, sometimes shuttering series of climaxes. This is then reduced down to a concentrated chapter of events that will leave the outside viewers and fans alike giddy and shaken. \nSit back and enjoy the new canvas the directors and writers splatter, like bright paint, both nostalgia and Fresh life with our characters.  This is NOT age of ultron. \nThis avengers is to avengers 1 what ragnorak was to Thor 1, except with everybody youve been waiting to see again, plus guardians, plus mystic arts, plus an antagonist that shouldn't even be called a movie villain, but an inevitable turning point character.

Tom Holland's acting is out of this world. 10/10 Definitely would let it destroy my life again.", "TWO AND HALF HOUR OF PURE PLEASURE \nthe end blew my mind", "It would be the darkest superhero movie if everything just stop here. Supervillains eventually won this one, and retired peacefully. Heroes are suffering from losing their comrades. Fans are hung there FOREVER. Those good actors could finally go back and focus on real acting performance. How ridiculous it sounds? No way MCU will quit exploiting this trillion dollar IP which they have spent more than a decade to build. Actually, the after-credit scene has already revealed that Cpt Marvel is coming. Ant-man and the Wasp are only two month away. Dr Strange promises that as long as these fellow up movies could make more than 14 million dollars, fans would see they win. Easy peasy. Fans, just go see incoming MCU movies, make sure the company won't break before part 2 comes out. It is not that hard to bring the other half of heroes back from another universe where \"Zayn is still in One Direction\", as mentioned by Stephen Hawking. If Rick and Morty can do that, Tony Stark can definitely do the same. Sorry for being off the point. The whole movie is fabulous. It has the greatest visual effects and the most prestige cast you could expect. There is a fight scene after another. If it were a standalone movie, it had the deepest and the darkest story comparing with other MCU movies I had watched. I actually haven't watched too many of them. Logan is rather sad than dark to me. Some plots don't make sense to me. Some of them are because I haven't watch all other MCU movies.

Directors have absolutely knocked it out of the park with the writing, screenplay and special effects. Performances were amazing, especially Josh Brolin, who actually did the impossible making the villain likable. This is an amazing culmination of 10 years of MCU movies. Extremely excited to see Avengers 4", "Utterly amazing!\nWas not expecting the twist but I was prepared to cry and boy did I!", "A must watch for all MARVEL Superhero movie buffs, rest if you cannot resist give a try, you may like it. The movie is funny, has a story (does that matter) and carries one of the best Superhero movie villain in the history of movies (probably). He grabs more screen time than most of the SUPERHEROES in the movie. Moreover, Thanos is a villain who also 'cries'. Surprisingly, the story does not end here, i.e, after over 2 hrs. Yes it has a sequel! I would not be surprised if Thanos is made a SUPERHERO. He has the moves, the voice , the power.", "Thanos is the best villain in MCU, great storytelling, felt no left a plot hole", "Thanos surprised me with his range, he isn't just the big bad, there is some genuine pathos here and Josh Brolin is fantastic here.\nPretty much the movie was going great until they went to Wakanda, where the last half hour or so of the film really fell flat for me. I would've liked to have seen the big battle take place somewhere real, a real world city, not a magic city I don't care about, might as well have been in Kun Lun.\nI would also like to have seen more shots of what Thanos did with that last fatal snap, not just to the heroes and to that one street in New York after the credits, but across the planet and even the universe at large. Trillions died, but it felt more like dozens, there should have been something like when Ego tried to do the same thing with his blobby plant things in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, where you see Xandar and Eath and other crazy planets getting messed up. I realize that this is movie is part one of two, but it still needs to stand alone, and the consequences of the most significant finger snapping in comic book history should have been overwhelmingly displayed.\nAdditionally, I'm afraid that Marvel has overplayed their hand here. I expected a bloodbath but there is no way they will leave THIS half of their heroes dead, as I should point out that most of the ones that kicked it were NEW to the universe (Really? You expect me to believe SPIDERMAN, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange are all dead after only one movie each?? (Not to mention almost the entire cast of GoG)\nAs such you can't take the consequences seriously, which detracts from the narrative, in particular the death of Gamora, which at the time was a tear jerker and really shone the light on Thanos' humanity.\nNow I feel like they will just bring her back with the rest somehow in the second movie. Boo.\nAnd just to nitpick, the new Iron-Man suit is stupid, Iron-Man has always been a heavy hitter because of how SOLID he is, so suddenly replacing his suit with nano-particle Transforers 4 bullcrap was just awful.\nSadly, Thor's axe also ends up kind of sucking; as far as names go \"Mjolnir\" is far better than the generic \"Stormbreaker\" and in terms of appearance, the wooden handle is just too big and cartoonish, though I loved that Groot made it for him.\nIn the end, while the film was not a brutal disappointment as I feared, it is still a disappointment.\n7/10 Stars", "It's An Unexpected Action Comedy Thriller.

Very good", "You know I still love it. That is why I gave 8 stars. But the movie is also fundamentally flawed in my opinion.  I get it jokes are fun and good. And some of the jokes actually do work great here. Some other scenes are just stupid (as for example Black Widow getting blood spilled on her face in the middle of a battle and making a \"joke\" scene out of it). I feel like the movie is actually not dark enough (spare your DC comments). Because I also feel like Marvel recycles the success principle they discovered in the first Guardians movie (fast-paced, pun-heavy, colorful and action-driven) and do not venture in anything new.  I truly think the best thing about the movie is Thanos. I really liked and enjoyed him. No matter the critics (no movie villain will fully ever make sense). But finally we got a threatening, dark but complex villain showing no mercy driven to pursue his goals and doing so successfully.  Many other things dampen the great impression I think such as: \n-- too much action and fights in the first half of the movie. You become saturated unfortunately quickly with too many fights. \n-- too many jokes (especially some of them were just bad and annoying like the one mentioned above. And you feel how they tried to incorporate them in there.\n-- the movie was epic and felt so but could have felt far more epic even if they did not try to copy the fun-marvel guardians principle for once and would have concentrated on dark epic story-telling \n-- very many illogical and unsatisfying thing happening as the death of Loki or Hulk just losing a boxing match against Thanos while others (Thor to be precise) can still hurt him and bring actually close to death while he already wields all 6 infinity stones? this difference in fight writing makes no sense to me. \n-- just ridiculous things as casting peter dinklage as supersized dwarf. Sorry, I love Dinklage in GOT and everything, but here the scene felt like a parody of GOT and the whole MCU to me, as if you can see the directors being like \"oh you know what let us do something sooo funny and cast Peter Dinklage as giant (dwarf). Stupid unncessary decision. If so you could have made him look cool at least (and not show Dinklage's face with a beard basically).", "Totally dserve watching After 10 years waiting for final chapter.

Movie continues exiciting as I said before \"until ending\". Moreover some characters like ant-man and Hawk-eye are absent I think this is not problem even if they would in the movie, they wouldn't have got prominent screen time for example characters like winter soldier, black Panther, black widow nearly have no prominent affect movie however they had screen time and I wanna talk about Star-lord's ridiculous acts firstly he tries to kill Gamora as he promised to her but after that, when avengers were taking infinity gaunlet from hand of Thanos, he attacks him so they couldn't take it. Finally, where is the Strongest avenger? If I go to an avengers movie, I wanna see more Hulk not Bruce banner inside of Hulkbuster, I'm dissapointed when I saw in the Trailer Hulk was in the battle in wakanda, directors or producers some kind of deceived us.\nOne more thing if they do ressurection thing like in the comics then, I will stay away from MCU however, I have already watched all 19 movies.", "This movie is awesome..hats off to Russo brothers to give such a wonderful movie.\nThe action is great, the acting is great and the THANOS is way good and the best villain in MCU...Hats off.", "We all know that after Thanos dies every lead character like Iron man,Captain America,Thor and Hulk will not be appearing but Spider Man, Black Panther have sequels to come but coming back to this movie Infinity war gets your seat and not an single scene where you get bogged down because every scene has its meaning which will make you love the superheroes and hate Thanos", "Loki's arrival back in 2012, and Ultron's activation in 2015, both share a common characteristic that completely isolates Thanos. With Loki and Ultron, they both were building and establishing their attack, while The Avengers were doing the same with the extra mile of having to construct the safest form of defense. However, in contrast, Thanos has already built, structured and established his attack, while the now Non-Avengers have no idea what, when or how said attack will occur. If you understand that, I believe then, that this whole movie will fall into perspective. Thanos never made an entrance, he was always in the room all along. The Avengers were watching all the doors and guarding all the windows, from a threat that already was. From a threat that already had the keys. That is why Infinity War ended the way it did, and it was perfect. After watching this epic gargantuan of a film, I realized that Thanos HAD to win, for him to live up to who he knows he is. Who we know him to be. We, the audience and fans needed to feel true powerlessness and loss of hope, especially because Loki and Ultron failed in those pursuits, thus, Thanos HAD to succeed everywhere they failed, and Gamora further symbolized that terrifically. This was not The Avengers' movie, not by a long shot. This, was truly and utterly Thanos' exravaganza. The story, is sublime. Avengers: Infinity War was not perfect however. Far from it in fact. But, it was so massive, that its imperfections were like wrinkles on an old, Soul. This film felt rushed, but it wasn't. It was efficient, and productive, however, though that is an excellent approach for the most part for a film this huge, it also is a consequence, because it robs us of certain joys we would've loved to be immersed in. The visuals were too much of what we've seen before. Though they were amazing, they did lack a certain inspiration, and inspired moments are what we've come to expect from the MCU. The fight sequences too were not as infinitely impressive as they could've been, but they were great, with sprinkles here and there of absolutely stunning set pieces. There is so much to say about this film it's insane, from good to bad, and that is a good thing I suppose, because that means we will all be talking about this grand, monumental epic for a long while to come.  8.1/10.", "Sorry but it really does live up to the hype, we were totally enthralled- had us guessing throughout and on the edge of our seats", "NO SPOILERS - Good to read before the film This movie is almost everything. Thanos has a great back story and you almost feel sorry for him. Action is very epic with a lot of great shots and great continuety. Also great to see all of the heroes work together. Doctor strange is a big part of that. The battle sequences make the adrenaline in your body floating out like water. At Some points it feels a bit overpacked and Some scenes are brief, but you only realise that after the film. This is a MUTCH WATCH experience especially in iMax beacaise of the enormous screen and banging sound you feel the tense in every single bone of your body.", "Infinity War contends to be the best movie of the superhero genre ever made. The sheer feat of juggling such a massive cinematic universe and having he pieces land in place is something I would have thought impossible, yet having missed 4 of the 18 movies preceding it (missing Ragnarok was the biggest gap going in) the entire film still flowed incredibly smoothly. I am and know some real hardcore comicbook enthusiasts, and so will there will always be some squandered potential, plot elements that did not fire on all cylinders, or characters we want to see more of, but there are strikingly few missteps to pick out given the scope of this film's ambitions. The incredible number of characters, plot lines and events that fit in here rarely seems ponderous, helped by a script that is laugh-at-loud funny without sacrificing the impact of the third act. The strongest part of the movie is the villain. Thanos is scarily powerful, and from the very first scene it's clear that he means business. He is charismatic, intelligent, and, once he has the necessary power, pursues his goal with relentless determination. In another world, this movie should have been titled Thanos: Infinity War, because this movie is really his story. His performance and presence are more than enough to forgive his (one exception here) rather forgettable henchmen. However, would I have really wanted them to have more screen time at Thanos' expense? Hell no. In the end, this movie doesn't work if you haven't spent the time to watch previous movies. If you've read the New Yorker review, the author wastes a lot of ink spelling out \"I haven't watched any of the other movies, so I'm confused and that is YOUR FAULT\". Try watching Return of the King and then leave being mad at the movie for not explaining all the characters (again) for you. These characters don't evolve in this movie, because this movie is about the culmination of all their individual story arcs over the past 10 years. Will that leave some people behind? Of course, but that's the price of admission for a coalescing of a cinematic universe into one movie the likes of which has never been tried before. Aside: There are some reviews of this movie that are explicitly low because people think that this movie deserves a lower rating than their peers have given it. Retribution against fellow users of this kind seems silly, but there is at least one question raised relevant to the discussion: should fantasy movies like this be rated in the context of other movies of it's kind or should they be seen in the greater context of all cinema. Infinity War isn't as emotionally penetrating as Schindler's list, nor as artistically daring as Mother!, but these are the wrong expectations, at least to me.", "Personally thought it was a great film. Bit over rated for No 9 of all films on IMDB but none the less great. Thanos was the best character due wrath for the stones. excellent fight scenes. Nice bringing more Marvel characters in to expand depth of universe. Overall a solid Marvel Avengers film.", "Direction: Director Duo Anthony and Joe Russo got fame when they had directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016). They have done exceptionally brilliant job for Avengers because they have used strength of each and every superhero in right proportion. Audience hail the direction when they feel connected with the script and characters through out the movie. Entry of each superhero create some noise, claps and whisttles in the cinema halls especially Captains's entry. Performance: As multi-starer movie is always a challenge for director to maximum utilization of each resource. I can say that each charter has given his 100% in this epic war saga. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Evans and Tom Holland have leaded from the front. Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Paul Bettany,Elizabeth Olsen and Anthony Mackie also did justice with their role and power. Josh Brolin has played unforgettable role of super villain. Script: Hats off to script writer Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for brilliant writing as inclusion of emotions in the Action based Super heroes flick. There are some light moments also delighted the story-line. Dialogues: Dialogues were witty and full of punches. When Iron man include Spider man into Avengers , he did something like priest did in the church after throwing Holy water. That scene was quite funny. Conversation between Thanos and Iron man was also epic and some clue lie in that conversation as well. Box-Office: On opening day, it has collected 31 crores so 100 crores will be target for Weekend. As partial holiday on Monday and Tuesday so momentum will be continue in first week. Second week will be decide whether it will earn 200 crores only in Indian domestic market or not. Last Words: Don't afraid about many spoilers posted on social media because no one able to comprehend the climax of this movie. Everyone waiting for sequel of this movie so that there will be end of their curiosity. So wait for 3rd may 2019.", "The film is intense, full of fighting scenes and give audiance no time to relax.", "Infinity war is the superhero finale we've all been waiting for. it's action-packed, funny and it truly shows the best sides of all our favourite heroes. the 10 year build up to infinity war is surely worth the wait and is truly one of marvel's best films to date. the wait for part 2 is definitely going to be a long one!", "Avengers: Infinity War is finally here, bringing with it all sorts of questions about just what comes next for the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the wake of Thanos true arrival. I'm excited to watch Avengers: Infinity War part 2.", "The Hollywood movie you expect!!\nLoved it from start to the end.", "The definition of Marvel is \"to be affected with wonder and astonishment, as at something surprising or extraordinary\". Disregarding puns aside, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the perfect encapsulation of its brand's namesake, as feelings of sheer 'wonder and astonishment' is what I experienced while watching the film. \nSomehow the Russo Brothers have managed to create a huge cinematic event that lives up to all the hype. This is one of the best MCU films yet, and this isn't just because of its size and spectacle. It still uses elements of the Marvel formula, so to speak, which have worked so well before, being bombastic action sequences and humorous character interactions, and unsurprisingly dials them up to 11. But then, these elements are applied and seamlessly blended with a tone which isn't exactly dark, but definitely desperate, which brings about a larger sense of danger and consequence that has never been done in one of these films before. \nWhile there isn't much of a plot outside of trying to stop Thanos from assembling the Infinity Gauntlet, it's the character interactions I mentioned before that Marvel usually does so well that keeps the audience captivated. And somehow, the Russos, along with screenwriters Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely, pull it off so well. This film has a gargantuan cast, and it manages to combine the differing tones from the various franchises without feeling cluttered. The duo of Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch as Iron Man and Doctor Strange makes complete sense, as their wit, sarcasm and goatees create great potential for friction and disagreement. An enthusiastic and awe-ridden Spider-Man also tags along with them, and Tom Holland makes it seem he's constantly amazed to witness the events taking place just like the audience. The campy cosmic styles of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy mesh together exceptionally and undoubtedly deliver the best uses of comedy. And the majority of the cast from 'Civil War', along with a few other additions engage in an awesome climactic battle in the 'Black Panther' setting of Wakanda. Naturally, not a lot of these characters understandably go through much development, which was a miracle in itself to see in Civil War, but a few do. This being Hulk, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Gamora, and especially Chris Hemsworth as Thor, who has further transformed his once disengaging character until 'Ragnarok', to probably the best Avenger, who has the most legitimate reasons to be engaged in this conflict. \nBut the best character is the big bad himself, Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers an incredible performance of this character, who has been built up and hyped for so many years now, and he completely subverted my expectations. He is not the loud-spoken, egotistic, emotionless monster that had been previously portrayed in his cameos, who seemed to lack any form of motivation outside of a thirst for universal conquest. Instead, he is now a soft-spoken, sardonic, charismatic but fearsome individual, who has surprisingly altruistic motives for collecting the Infinity Stones and using them for universal genocide, that actually makes reasonable sense. And because of this, he is faced with certain challenges that he has to go through in order to achieve his goals, which demonstrates the raw determination of this character that makes him all the more compelling to watch. Some of my personal favourite scenes were just dialogue between him and one other character, which effectively utilises Brolin's acting skills to show Thanos' more emotional and sensitive side, which I found more interesting, that overall creates what is probably the best comic-book villain since Chris Nolan's 'Dark Knight' Trilogy. \nThe structural features on display are mainly on-point. Trent Opaloch returns as the cinematographer from the Russos' previous 'Captain America' films, but this time suitably cuts down on the shaky-cam techniques which work well with the grounded tone of those films. Instead, there is a naturally more vibrant and poppy colour palette unlike his previous dull and graded cinematography. And every shot which encompassed this is just simply gigantic, which fits greatly with the enormous stakes of the film. Alan Silvestri makes a welcome return as the composer, and while there aren't any memorable tracks outside of the recurring motifs from the first 'Avengers', the score as a whole is noticeably emotive and synchs up well with the majority of the scenes, which creates more of an aural impact than the forgettable background noise in 'Age of Ultron'. The visual effects are very impressive, especially the motion capture used for Thanos, as it effectively picks a lot of subtle facial expressions Brolin uses to perform, that make him seem all the more realistic. And while I'd say the CGI does not reach the levels of visual splendour shown in 'Guardians Vol. 2', for the most part, they successfully merge with the live action, and work as a major improvement over the PS2 graphics in 'Black Panther'. \nDespite my gushing, there are certain issues on display. I felt like the script allowed for characters to make choices and actions which were either extremely convenient or inconvenient so that the story could proceed accordingly without having to grind to a sudden, albeit logical halt. And being the nineteenth instalment in this cinematic universe, there are going to be obvious continuity errors, as I found some events in previous films, especially 'Ragnarok', did not lead into this as well as they could have. And I already mentioned the size of the ensemble cast, unfortunately, means a few characters are dismissed from having actual development, especially the other villains, Thanos' Black Order, who don't contribute much except interesting designs and opponents for the Avengers. But this is only Part 1, so I believe the few heroes who felt left behind outside of fighting will get more time to develop properly in Part 2. \nThus, 'Avengers: Infinity War' epitomises how to culminate a cinematic universe with now a decade of history, which is not showing any signs of franchise fatigue. And yet somehow, it also manages to be a shocking, thrilling, grandiose event, where it becomes the prime example of pure popcorn cinema. This is why these films appeal to the masses, and so they should.", "I never give 10 stars but I can't stop thinking about this movie days after seeing it. All the story lines are brilliantly intertwined for all the varied superheroes and past movies. We were left devastated, but hopeful at the end of this one. \nI had to run out and rent Thor: Ragnorok the next day to help make sense of a few things. Glad I saw most of the others because it makes this film all the richer. I just need to see the Dr. Strange movie to get a totally complete picture, then you can be sure I will be watching Infinity War again! \nThis movie pulls on just about every emotion and leaves us craving more story, more answers. Who will return and who will not. This is what it's all about. We are getting attached to every character, love them teaming together in fun, battle and in tragic times. They are each fantastic in their own way. I can't wait until May to see Part 2, and all the Marvel movies that are to come. Final note: Iron Spider MUST LIVE!", "Infinity war had so many expectations going into it. Almost every expectation was met when it was finished. The movie does a fantastic job juggling all of the different characters together while weaving the last 10 years of marvel together. They were able to make it emotional and intense without a dull moment. The movie has its negatives but the positives far out weigh them. For a movie of this scope and magnitude it did a great job.", "How can people voting 1/10 be taken serious?? Even if you really hatted the movie, i don't see how can it be less than a 6/10. For me, this film is better than all 18 MCU films that came before, and if you watched all of them (at least the avengers and one thor, captain america, iron man, guardians of the galaxy) you'll understand everything (plot, jokes, drama etc..).\n9/10 (I put 10/10 to contrast with all the 1/10)", "I've seen a handful of any of the marvel movies at most and can I just say wow!!! The banter between characters was humorous and it was TOTALLY worth the extra money to see in 3D. I'm sure die hard fans/ purists of the marvel world will find fault in it somehow but I truly enjoyed myself.", "There is only one way to win the battle out of 14mil ways.  A detailed narration of the above line is Infinity War. This is one of the movies which I eagerly waited on this year 2018. I am not going to analyse this movie, just my point of view. Story: Villain is trying to get all the infinity stones and Heroes are trying to stop him.as we already knew. Though the story line is simple, all the pieces have been put together from the past films (So if you've missed any of previous film, Please watch it first). Especially, the end credit already created the eager for the next film (Not Infinity War 2). This is the place where MCU scored full marks. Other than that, I am unable to give full credit for this movie. Fight Fight Fight.... This movie is full of fight. From start till end. Villain is fighting with Iron man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor and goes on. Nobody is putting end neither Hero nor Villains. The biggest plus of MCU is comedy which is heavily missing though the movie has lots of funny hero characters like Spider man, Star lord, Groot.... The movie is entirely traveling on the shoulders of the villain i.e Thanos. But, I am not able to identify him as a full time villain since he is also having soft spots like sentiments and morals. So the villain is pretty much same as from the movie Captain America and Civil war (Russo Brother's recipe may be?) And some characters are missing like Valkyrie, Korg. Not sure why they cut them out of picture deliberately. It's not Russo's and MCU's best. Still, we can't avoid. How could we...Since we have waited 10 Years for this movie.", "When I saw Iron Man for the first time in theaters , I was a kid who just discover Comic books and I would never thought , 10 years later , a movie like Infinity War were going to happen . This movie is like a combination of Comic book fan dreams : The crossover and the multiples interactions between characters , The gigantic battles , the surprise and the vilain ( Josh Brolin is clearly MVP here ) but if you are a bit of a cinephile , you might be disturbed by the direction who are not very great if not terrible , or some lazy writing or some characters development . Even with these problems , Infinity war didn't disappoint and is by far one of the best MCU movies", "One can say that for ten years running the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to amaze and their latest installment 'Avengers: Infinity War' is a constant reminder that these characters have leapt out of their comic book pages and onto the big screen. With an all-star cast of familiar names and faces gracing the screen like Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson, and many others, I couldn't fathom how much they went through to finally come together in one movie. Director Joss Whedon helped kick off two Avengers films in 2012 and 2015, but thanks to brothers Joe and Anthony Russo (Captain America: Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War) they've pushed it further with these established characters and have a story worth telling. With the Mad Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) unleashing destruction in his wake to gather all the Infinity Stones that the heroes have kept safe in the past, it's up to the Avengers to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him at all cost. The Russo Bros. did an excellent job in directing and gathering all these actors who not only gave splendid performances, but had its audience immerse themselves into a whirlwind of triumph and tragedy. Compared to a few past MCU titles, 'Infinity War' had the right balance of both witty humor and drama blended well into the action that it didn't derail the story itself. It kept me intrigued and curious to see what its mythos and pathos can do. When the movie ended, it had me left speechless and with so many questions looming over what lies ahead. I've heard some complaints from some people I've met saying they didn't like it because it didn't flesh out all the characters properly, missing other notable heroes, or lacked depth in the film's story, but I beg to differ. Since this is only the first half, surely its second half will bring this story to a decent close. My only nitpick was indeed that a few other heroes didn't show, but that's okay since they could likely be saved for its follow-up. Compared to past MCU villains, I was intrigued with the directors' approach in making Thanos being more than just a typical power-hungry villain, but somewhat sympathetic as well. Music composer Alan Silvestri's underscore is a brilliant accompaniment to the most pivotal scenes too. To close, this movie is, by far, a culmination of Marvel's wide assortment of heroes raising the bar in their shared universe. Only time will tell on what more can Marvel dish out from here beyond this Phase Three. The works of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Joe Simon are now more than just drawings on comic book pages, they are embodiments who've made their mark in cinema.", "See this movie from the other side, and Thanos is never a normal bad guy, he had his point and his bottom line that he never crossed.", "It is really increcible how this movie don't let you blink ever and those 2 hours and 36 minutes you wish them to be more. The Russo Brothers made an awsome job giving each character a very important participation in the film and all the story interlace extremelly well between one shot and another. I was expecting less but this movie really impressed me and I am eager to see it again. I have never seen and enemy (Thanos) with so logical arguments that sometimes you want to be on his side instead of Avengers. That was impacting.", "So its all led to this.... But the problem is this much awesomeness CANT be only 2 hours and 29 minutes long! (Actual film length is 2 h 17 m.)\nThis movie needed to be LOTR Extended edition long. Hell if were to be the worlds first 5 hour movie it would have been a GOOD length. So the movies only flaw is that its very rushed. Other than that it is a AMAZING movie,\nBut very predictable. And I like that about it. The ending was exactly what I expected and exactly what i wanted. I am content. To state it plainly, this is The Dark Knight level.", "I can imagine that this is what the final season of game of thrones will look like! Every minute was thrilling and I felt like even though the cast was spread out not a second was wasted! Great mix of action, comedy and excellent story telling. I just don't know what else to say other than I'll be watching this film many times! Epic movie with a couple of sad moments but plenty of kick ass ness", "Avengers Infinity War it\u00b4s the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it\u00b4s the conclusion of 10 years of movies, with all of the characters (or most of them) coming together in one big, ambitious movie project.\nThis is a movie that took years to develop because of the release of the movies and for the development of all of the characters and story arcs.\nLet\u00b4s now focus on the movie properly, in Infinity War the heroes must come together to defeat the big guy :Thanos. \nThe story works, it\u00b4s not a great script and certainly marvel has done better, but it works.It\u00b4s great to see all of this characters together and all of the interactions between them.The villain is great, Thanos has presence he\u00b4s intimidating and the his story line made sense, the relation between him and Gamora was one of the most interesting parts of the movie as it gave depth to the character. The directing is good, the visual effects and the action sequences are impressive as they usually are in these movies. In moments i felt that there was probably an excess of action sequences, it was just a little too much.\nBy the end, Infinity War might not be the best marvel movie, but it\u00b4s an exciting, funny, touching and overall satisfying addition to the Marvel franchise. 8.0/10", "When watching super hero movies I have one problem: there is often no stakes. Example, when watching Black Panther there was a period of time when I was just waiting for T'challa to come back to life, and of course, he did. This movie totally flips the script. From the beginning to the end I was scared of my favorite, often young, characters dying. Annnnddd guess what...it was a bloodbath. PEOPLE DIED. And it was NOT the people you would expect. In the end, we were left with a a familiar, but mixed group of people. I CANNOT WAIT for what is coming next. Now I just have to wait a year...I don't know if I can make it.", "This is definitely one of the most shocking, action-packed Marvel movies todate! It is devastating, but it doesn't disappoint! I can't wait to see how they follow up this story line!", "I walked out of this movie with so much on my mind, it messed with me like no other movies ever has. Yes, some people won't like the ending but I thought it was perfect. For once are hero's lose to an actual threatening villain. And the deaths were handled perfectly, even though we know that some will be back. It was very well paced for how many characters there was. Simply a masterpiece.", "I love that Marvel said this would be the movie event that everything led to, and then didn't shy from the moment and made a great movie. It's extremely difficult to tie the enormous number of characters in together without having the movie just be exposition, so they did a great job of focusing on Thanos and how he affects the Avengers and using the previous movies as crucial backstory. They did a great job of clearly explaining Thanos' mindset and justification, and I found his character arc intriguing and very believable. The visuals and performances, especially from Saldana, were great as always, and I thought the pacing of the movie was great. Certainly an emotional ending, and it didn't quite feel like it had that amount of weight as it seems certain that half of people who died will be brought back, but regardless of the implications, it was a good ending for the movie. I thought Thor's journey for his hammer and the explanation of why he needed it after seeming to not need it in Ragnarok, how he made that one attached to him, and why the dwarf was so necessary were all not well explained, but in the grand scheme of the movie it doesn't really detract and was just a lesser section. Downey was excellent, and I loved their focus on him and Cumberbatch. Infinity War was the most excited I've ever been for a movie release, and it absolutely delivered.", "Well well well, look who decided to watch another superhero movie? It's here! Infinity War is finally here, after 10 years of MCU movies and over 20 years of fan boys waiting to see the mad titan on screen! This review is for dad's all over the world trying to find out what their children have been bugging them about. Let's get right to the point, go watch this movie. Want more detail? Here we go. This movie starts off extremely well, building up that dark tone which lasts throughout the entire movie. There are three teams. We have the New York team, which consists of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Hulk. We have the Wakanda team, which consists of Captain America (who now goes by the name Nomad), Black Widow, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and of course, T'Challa himself, the Black Panther. Lastly, we have the Space team, which consists of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. These three lines have their own individual story lines, yet they all slowly start connecting together. Feel that the plot is moving a bit fast with all the jump cuts? That's normal, after all, this is a marvel movie, not Dunkirk. Let's tackle the simple question, shall we? Why is Infinity War so talked about? Well, here's your answer: Remember all those random marvel movies that kept coming out? Only so you, the parent, could say \"Marvel has so many superheroes! All they need to do is to keep making movies of them and then they're set for life!\" Basically, that's what happened. Infinity War has all those characters in it. Hence \"the biggest crossover...\" Up until this point, some of the characters have been in their own world, minding their own business, such as the Guardians of the Galaxy. There was no connection to the Avengers or anything throughout the two movies, which is why it's fascinating to see them interact with all the characters who HAVE BEEN interacting with each other. Haven't seen a marvel movie in a while? Are you absolutely clueless are what infinity stones are? Don't worry, this movie does an amazing job of putting together the little bits of knowledge everyone knows and expanding upon them. Here's another reason why this movie is gaining popularity: people are going to die. You heard it here first, well, that's a lie. Your child kept telling you that, so this is more like the 10th time? Most of the characters you have been with for the last few years meet their ends, and it's up to you to find out. Do I, the parent, need to watch this?: my father personally isn't in to superheroes very much. I, on the other hand, am. I own dozens of comics and know exactly how each character is the way they are. I drove my dad with me to the theaters each time a marvel movie came out, some he loved, some he didn't. Go watch this with your children, you'll have a blast! Violence/Gore/Sexual Scenes?: some kissing (it's what people do). As said before, people do meet their end, some quick and easy, and others slow and painful. Nothing your child can't handle. Although they might get emotional when some, specific character dies, nothing too much to be worried about. Conclusion: fill up your gas (even though it's reallly expensive), go down to the theater, and watch this movie. Not only will you enjoy it, your kids will enjoy it x10 more that they will bug you for the coming days, maybe even weeks. That's called parenting. I'm 15, what do I know about parenting?", "10 years of Marvel movies leading up to this-most of them very good. I've read the comics, so I knew what to expect, though I don't recall Guardians of the Galaxy characters in the original story. A lot of great action and surprisingly a lot of comedy still too! Spiderman had the best lines! A very good villain and overall super fun, yet darker movie. Not quite DC level dark, but emotionally I suppose. I did feel close to tears at one point actually, but it's because I've grown very attached to these characters. Of course it ended with a big cliff hanger to be continued next year, but I knew that going in.", "**Light Spoilers, sorry. \nThere's a lot going on in this movie. We have heroes in pretty much any place you would think of: on spaceships, desolate planets, cloaked villages, dying stars, alternate universes/realities, just everywhere. Everyone we've seen thus far in the MCU, besides one or two, have appearances and missions to complete. It felt like a non-stop train on a mission to get to the next city, but it's being blown up, and there are people trying to rob it, and there are couples in different cars showing affection, but there's a brain surgeon on board that has the cure for cancer, and a family arguing over a patriarch's death, and another woman learning the truth of her adoption, and all these people trying to stop the train from being blown up, all while riding on the train, going 200 mph. I laughed, I cried, I said \"Oh Hell No!\" At least twice, and I know I gasped and held my breath for a majority of it. I enjoyed every second of the ride. Also, Whovians, watch for the reference, be prepared to have some feels, and don't say I didn't warn ya.", "The movie as a whole of course is amazing but it does have some flaws. \n1- it's really disjointed, because you've got so many characters and so many different situations with stones, I think it can make it difficult to keep up\n2- sadly the ending is so predictable- we all know they are coming back to life, see you back in 2019. (I mean all of the Guardians are hardly going to be dead) \n3- some bits are really really good, and some bits are so underwhelming. I mean visions death. Horrific. But Loki and glamora, if they really are dead they deserved a better send off from the marvel universe.", "We saw the movie today, discussed it for about 10 minutes afterwards, and now have moved on. Overall, because of the \"scenes in space,\" this movie felt more like a Guardians movie with a little extra Avengers, not an Avengers movie with a little bit of Guardians. None of the Avengers had enough screen time to satisfy any of us, but all the Guardians had quite a lot of screen time. Because there were \"scenes on Earth\" and \"scenes in space,\" the story felt chopped up; it was as if Thanos' minions were fighting one war and he himself was off fighting a different one. Disappointing in its inability to grab and hold our interest - but nice to see the old gang on the screen again. This is the first movie in the MCU that we probably won't bother buying on disc. Also, I was really hoping Bucky and Dr. Strange would share some interactions, but they didn't :-)", "Infinity War was a great MCU film. A little anti-climactic, but had a huge cliffhanger. Going to preorder on Amazon, just because it was so good.", "The movie made the audience feel so many different emotions throughout the film. The film makes you mark the calendar for the next one to see your favorite characters again!", "Thie movie gave me everything I wanted. The characters are weak and human, which is something I hadn't seen since The Dark Knight. Although all heroes assemble, ehich is what all of us were eaiting for, the real star here is Thanos. The film gives us reasons to care abd understand him and what he has sacrificed. He is almost as fantastic as Heath Ledger's Joker which makes him the best and the star of this movie. If you haven't yet seen it I implore you to go and see it. This is the definitive Marvel masterpiece and deserves being praised for years to come.", "INEVITABLE Dread him, run from him... Thanos still arrives.", "Short review: Honestly, this movie was spectacular to look at. The visuals were outstanding and from that point of view, it gets a 9/10 (nothing is ever perfect). But.. From my own point of view, regarding the movie as a whole, it gets a 6,5/10. Throughout the whole movie, they were just fighting.. And fighting.. And fighting. The story evolved and then they kept on fighting. Some people might like this and get excited by it, but not me. I do recommend watching it if you like superheroes or movies with a lot of special effects, but (a lot of \"buts\") for me it got way too much.", "This brought so many things to fruition. AMAZING point blank, period.", "This movie has problems , i will list them:\n1.There is plot hole, we do not see Thanos how he destructed Zandar ,how he got the Power Stone , we also do not see Thanos how he battled in the beginning with Hemidall and Thor people.\n2.Vison powers are not shown, you see Vision beaten up several times and stabbed like he is an ordinary guy and not an superhero , they had to show Vision powers, what we get from Vison is only that he shots a laser beam to one of the members of Black Order and what a surprise The Black Order beats his guts.\n3.Groot powers are not also shown , i mean why you present a character when you dont present his special abillites.\n4.Thanos uses the powers of four stones , come on Thanos with all that power how did you let without using the Mind and Spirit stone power ,this is ridicilous.\n5.What we liked was to see Hulk battle ,but we only see him beaten up by Thanos and the green guy is afraid to show up himself.\n6.There is not enough action at all , ok there are some awesome scenes between Doctor Strange, Ebony Maw and Thanos but we needed more ,we needed all the avenger battle against Thanos and not separated.\n7.Iron Man suit is greatly advanced but with all those advances it makes it ridiculous and unbelievable, his suit was more original in Iron Man 1 and Avengers 1.\nOverall is a good movie with monotonous action scenes , a good comedy and some good unexpected emotional scenes.", "An emotional roller coaster from the get go. This movie provides the same humor and action that we have become Accustomed to but this time with heart wrenching storyline. My jaw was wide open when the credits rolled and I sat there in disbelief. A must see for the true Marvel fan and also the casual watcher.", "Great movie, great ending, and amazing characters!", "There is no way that this is better than the lotr fellowship of the ring, fight club and empire strikes back.", "Best marvel movie yet. Came in with low expectations as they were so high in the media. This movie had everything with very little timeout moments.\nWell done marvel the first marvel movie I Couldn't fault. Entertainment galore!", "The movie is very good,sheathed the screenplay ,the effects or the battles ,but the movie concentrates more in talking\nThan actual movie,& also make the villain much vulnerable than we think ,the sound effects could have been used as it was like some Star Wars theme ,other wise the movie was great & also tempt us to think what will happen next,,,", "Yes, just as I typed on this review title. The plot were able to be guessed except the ending part. At first I thought that the good ending are Thanos is gone, dead, disappear or else. But as Thanos said on how the planet he had annihilate half of the population, the citizens now born and live with stomach full, therefore it will be the same on earth. And its the good ending for humanity. So will the hero be back? Well it depends on are we wants to watch iron man 4 or Captain America 4 after thanos times? And who will they fought by then? Is it thanos super saiyan because a puny enemy are no longer challanging right. So I think if they\nBring it, the story line will be a mess. For me its better to dig in a new hero.", "It was so good that i'm going to watch it again! The Avengers: Infinity War isn't just a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie. It's also, at least arguably, a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of American cinema.", "The Infinity War has 10 years of back story leading to this, and even with the dozens of stars and characters, it managed to shine each and every character and everyone had their own time and role in the movie. It was a very ambitious project but I have to say, it did very well.  Thanos was just amazing. An antagonist instead of a simplistic evil villain, you simply cant hate him without feeling for him.", "Maybe my failure to follow MCU movies from the beginning is the reason why but I felt that there were way too many stories happening in this movie (they almost felt random) and they didn't make sense / didn't work for me. My husband actually fell asleep early on in the movie.", "If you're super into the Marvel universe, you'll love this movie. It's a great culmination of the last 10 years, and it felt more dynamic than others. I think it was fantastic that it made me care about Thanos and understand him, which I find difficult for other animated characters. The visuals were spectacular and in a few instances the shots looked absolutely beautiful. Most of the performances were pretty good, and I think the disparities in their performances had to come from being fed pretty awful lines of dialogue. The score was just as you'd expect, and there was nothing new about it. My main issue is with the writing. As I stated earlier, the dialogue was not good at all. Thanos seemed to be really easy to defeat considering the powers that he showed us that he had. He didn't seem to test the rules of his powers, or even use them at all. They clearly didn't have a \"refresh timer\" or something because of later scenes, so why would he not use them less sparingly? Most of it was predictable based on earlier scenes, and some of it felt like filler (but not much). The action was difficult to get into. It was at such a large scale that it was just more difficult for me to care about. I'd have to praise them for the ending, which made it much more enjoyable for me, but it didn't manage to push a 7 (It's a pretty high 6 though). I like how actions had consequences in this film, which is a relief from some of the other films (more than just Marvel) that I've seen recently. In the end, I'd like to give it a 7, but there were some aspects that were a little bit held back. Still, great as a Marvel movie, just pretty decent as a regular movie.", "The two things that Marvel movies have always been under criticism for are their villains and lack of stakes. Not only does Infinity War put those criticisms away, it takes full advantage of the gravitas of the comic book it's based on. I can't really imagine a better way that the MCU could have closed out a 19 movie arc, while also perfectly setting up the final (for now) installment next May. In one of the gutsiest and deadliest superhero films to date, The Russo Brothers have once again delivered a meaningful and thought provoking entry into the MCU. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to give all 30 something characters time to shine while also giving several of the big Avengers or Guardian related characters an impactful arc of their own. There are very minute pacing issues that perhaps some casual fans may take issue with, but for someone who has been with this universe from the beginning, I ate it all up. I'm not sure there are any directors who could have possibly executed this story as well as The Russo brothers did. As with Age of Ultron, I worried that the tone of the trailers (dark and serious) wouldn't really translate to the movie, as the MCU is known for its humor. Ultron was a very funny movie but it still felt like a missed opportunity to not have a little more emotional weight to that story. Luckily, Infinity War brilliantly balances humor, heart, and some serious sh*t that goes down in this adventure-heist-thriller.  Much like its comic-book counterpart, Infinity War follows Thanos (and it's largely his story) and his quest for the 6 Infinity stones which gives him the power to wipe out half the universe. How can you possibly give someone like that shades of humanity and an understandable motivation? Well somehow they did it, and when Thanos or someone else does things that bring the emotion out of him, it's some of the best sequences of the film. Most impressively, the Russo's and the writers figured out a way to pick up where we left each character while also making it fit into an Avengers story that needed them to more specific things related to a bigger threat. In other words, this film is driven by characters and not plot. As much as I love Age of Ultron, it feels more like a film that had their characters act based on where the filmmakers wanted the plot to go (i.e. Thor's quest in the middle of the film). Infinity War is far from that, and is clearly structured by filmmakers who still have stories left to tell in this universe. I could go on and on about specific plot elements, scene stealers, surprises, and the bold direction the film takes, but I decided to take a more vague approach to this review to not spread the spoilery thoughts that the internet has been filled with the past few days. In short, Infinity War is the most balls to the wall film Marvel has ever done, but still fills it with brilliantly quiet moments that made Civil War and Winter Soldier so groundbreaking. 10/10", "It is a very rare occasion feeling like you wish something must be done so the protagonists beat the antagonists in a film. When I watched this, I hoped the Avengers solve this huge and problematic villan they have to defeat. The one that will make them lose all hope just like I felt. And I put all this trust and hope in them. This feeling of imcompletecity and this desire the viewer gets is like nothing before. We seek to see the true heroes they are and how they can succeed in this seemingly impossible victory. Along with this, we have good characters, each with it's memorable and distinct personality, and they all go along well in the story. Accompanied with nice humor and with great action scenes that show unique powers and fights scenes that you even interrupt yourself while eating popcorn", "This movie deserves all the positive reviews that it's getting. It stays true to what Marvel is and it only makes me more excited for Avengers 4. Nothing wil be the same. So worth the time. Will absolutely have to see it again. 10/10.", "The best Marvel film so far non-stop action from start to finish amazing seeing all the characters together cannot wait till part two\nIronman, spinderman, Thor, and rocket the best characters \nWill be a classic film had that return of the Jedi feel to the film", "Wow.. amazing and brilliant.\nNothing ia too much.\nFunny , emotional, spectacular.\nI really feel that everything I'll write will hurt or offend this perfect movie. Words will fail to describe. Thank you for this work of art.", "Non-spoiler part: I know there will be some people who will want to give their edgy backlash hot take about how this movie wasn't that good or the ending was stupid or whatever, but don't listen to them. This movie was absolutely amazing and damn near perfect (yes, if you look hard enough at such a complex story like this you're going to find flaws, but you have to really be a nitpicker). \nSpoiler part: First of all, the chemistry between the various characters was one of the biggest strengths of this movie especially between Tony, Parker, Strange and the Guardians. I think Strange will be back and will find Tony to launch the comeback plan with the Time stone. The action scenes were another strength which has been a hallmark of the Russo films. The fight at the beginning between Thanos and Hulk really set the tone early. The fact that Thanos was basically toying with Hulk (AND Thor AND Loki AND Heindall in the same scene) makes the statement right off the bat that he is not to be f**ked with and that, yes, he is just as powerful as he was in the comics. The Ending: I thought the ending was great. I didn't feel cheated at all like many people are saying. If you know just the bare minimum of the Infinity War story line in the comics, you know this is how it had to go down and I'm glad they went there. If the heroes somehow pulled off the last-minute comeback and defeated Thanos, everyone would be complaining that it was too clich\u00e9, so relax and enjoy the story. But I think it's obvious a lot of the heroes who disintegrated will be back, but I don't think all. I think Black Panther will bring some back as it was alluded to in Black Panther that he has a connection with the Soul stone somehow. However, he might need to sacrifice all or some of his power. Finally, the scene where Spider-Man died was the most heart wrenching scene I've ever seen, but Tony will get his revenge even though he might sacrifice a lot.", "I don't want to go too much into detail with my review of this film, only that it is incredible and that you need to go and see this film before some inconsiderate A-hole spoils it for you!  This film was everything I wanted and more, all I can say is, bring on avengers 4!!!", "This movie is truly phenomenally astonishing. It will make you laugh, cry, break your heart and will it will keep you intense throughout the entire movie. The ending of the movie is very smart and is such a cliffhanger however, I do have faith in the Russo brothers in what their doing with the MCU. One of the biggest and best plot twists in any superhero movie takes place here in infinity war. It is when Thanos and Gamora go to a certain planet to get the soul stone and are greeted by what we think is death and the turn out to be the red skull. Later on in that scene Thanos sacrifices Gamora for the soul. This scene shows how ruthless he is and how he will stop at nothing to get what he wants. In the film we are shown a different type of Thanos the comics. We see Thanos as a ruthless mass murder who will stop at nothing, and we then feel sympathetic towards him in certain scenes. The ending of the film is truly confusing, I say this because Thanos gets all the infinity stones on the gauntlet and snaps his fingers. We then see and alternate reality where everything is destroyed. We then return to our reality, we then see every hero in the movie apart from Captain America, Iron man, Thor, Black widow, Hulk, war machine, rocket raccoon and okye (the original phase 1 avengers and other heroes) turn into ash and disappear (this does not mean their dead but, they have disappeared). We then see Thanos in most likely another planet sitting down without the infinity gauntlet with a smile on his face. A young Gamora then comes to confront him. She says to him \"what did it cost\" Thanos then reply's saying \"everything\" the film then cuts to black. The end credits scene shows Nick fury and Maria hill in a car. A car the crashes in front of them they then go to look at who's inside, it turns out that nobody was driving. Maria hill then turns into ash just before we see a helicopter crash to the ground. Nick fury takes out a retro looking device and says \"this is code red\" he turns on the device. Just while it's pending Nick fury turns into ash just before he finishes his sentence. After he disintegrated the device is finished pending and shows the captain marvel logo. This is meant to show that after her solo movie Captain marvel will return in avengers 4. The film then cuts to black and instead of showing \"the avengers will return\" as avengers movies usually show it says \"Thanos will return\". This is meant to show that Thanos will comeback and it will be a much bigger battle/movie than this one was. Overall this is a phenomenal movie and I strongly recommend everyone to go see it. It has truly been worth the 10 year wait.", "Ohhh guys this movie is gonna blow your mind you need to go watch itt!!", "I am not an avid comic book reader, but I am a huge fan of superhero films & read just enough comics for me to understand what's going on in the films. That said, Marvel delivered the massive epicness promised...with Thanos knocking the Hulk out within the 1st 10 min of the film. This movie is not perfect--no film is--but it's my favorite superhero film thus far. Thanos throwing a planet was so cool to see, & so was that snapping of the fingers with the Infinity Gauntlet! Did a lot of our superheroes die? Yes. Will they be resurrected/brought back? We'll have to wait & see. But generally, when I think of Thanos, I think of him snapping his fingers & killing half of all in the universe. If the Russo brothers did not deliver that iconic scene, I'd probably get really pissed off because that is what we've been building up to all this time. I really wish they gave Ebony Maw some more screen time. I liked him equally with Thanos & I would like them to bring him back in some way in future films.", "Will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie! Tears will fall, laughs will be heard and everything else in between. Yes, you will leave dumbfounded, wondering what your eyes have just witnessed. No, you will not be disappointed with anything, except for maybe Star-Lord.", "This is the best marvel film yet. It's sad to see that many people who didn't understand the movie or even didn't watch the movie are saying negative things about it.", "Like this movie will surprise you it will make you sad it will make you excited every thing was just so balanced in this movie it was perfect", "It's a Bold and ambitious one. Marvel has taken that leap which it should have taken years before.", "I refuse to write any spoilers so I'll just say this movie does not disappoint for any marvel fan. It a fun movie, you're emotions will be all over the place by the end and you'll be counting down the days for the conclusion.", "The movie was two hours and 30 minutes and the entire movie was exciting and full of action!", "What an excellent movie! The first ten minutes will blow you away and possibly make you shed a tear or two especially if you're a true Thor, Loki and Hulk fan. I was angry and thought WTF just happened during the first ten minutes of the movie. I literally held my heart as I continued to watch the movie. The movie was so intense. Other movie participants were gasping,laughing, and rooting for their favorite super heroes. We all wanted the Avengers to kill Thanos. I am a true fan of Marvel comics/super heroes and I was devastated that my heroes failed to eliminate the villain. Iron Man and Spider-Man were simply great together. Also, Dr. Stranger and Iron Man were a hoot!  Anyway I will stop here because I don't want to spoil the movie experience for others. Please note that all movie goers were clapping and cheering when the various heroes made their appearance. I thought I was going to collapse when my favorite super hero was stab! Marvel should give us fans a caution warning \"Emotional Trauma Alert.\" Go see this well executed movie. The ending will leave you angry because there is no closure. But I have to admit, I will see this a second time and I can't wait until 2019 to see the ending. Thanos will return in 2019!", "Went to see this movie tonight and the people in the theater were applauding!!! It was awesome! A must see!!!! Loved every minute.", "This movie had high expectations and it delivered. The interactions between various teamups were just awesome. There were a lot of funny and emotional moments in the film.  Thanos steals the show with Josh Brolin's amazing performance and the CG was on point. So much so that Thanos looks real. Thor was also a stand out character in the movie. In all, great characters and interactions. The last 15 minutes of the movie are basically where everyone in the audience just had there minds blown and hearts broken. It was an emotional ride and a ride I would love to experience multiple times.", "Greatest Marvel movie EVER. Thanos is a compelling villain and Josh Brolin delivers an outstanding performance. An easy 10/10", "After \"Black Panther,\" and \"A Quiet Place\" (2 films which received very high critical praise even though I personally thought they were long, boring, predictible nonsense films pretending to be something more than what they were) I had exremely low expectations for this film. I thought about skipping it all together. Without spoilers here is what I thought of \"Infinity War.\" Pros: Light hearted Marvel style comedy is back in full force. Getting a fix of my favorite Marvel Characters ( i.e. Thor, Dr. Strange, Star-Lord, Groot, Rocket, Spider Man, etc.). Several big budget action scenes. Not pretentious. It's a big buget superhero film and doesn't try to be anything else. The 3D was worth it. Cons: The Marvel film release schedule removes even the slightest doubt that certain characters were never in any real jeopardy (i.e. Black Panther).  Thanos is more exposition than action. He's probably the weakest part of the story even though they try hard to flesh him out. I can't reconcile the man with the monster he has already been painted as in previous installments. It may have been better to leave him pure evil than to try and rationalize his actions. He feels kind of silly now. Wakanda... still fighting with spears and shielding themselves with those goofy blanket cape forcefield thingys (at least there were no rhinos this time). Most action scenes were so far removed from civilization, it felt like there was not much at stake. No mention of Valkyrie. I hope she gets her own movie, maybe an R rated one like a female Deadpool.", "Avengers Infinity War is the long awaited superhero movie that all marvel fans have been waiting for. If you have kept up with the other 17 or 18 films to date, this movie does not disappoint. Even for those who barely keep up with marvel movies will enjoy this movie do to its great storyline and rollercoaster of emotions.", "Avengers: Infinity War is more than an epic, a masterpiece, an emotional ride, visual extravaganza and cinematic excellence. Infinity War is a dream come true for Marvel fans from all over the world. Infinity war is not just a cinema, it's an experience, 3 years of await, 10 years of exceptional journey and 18 movies of long thread lead to this. Everything about Infinity war is spellbinding and mind boggling. Hats off to the Russo Brothers(Anthony and Joe Russo) for bringing Infinity war into life and meeting up to the fans expectations and the hype, their vision is extraordinary, you will know once you see the movie, how great their direction was and characters build up. They just nailed it. Half of the total credits must go to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for the amazing screenplay. The movie starts off with Thor: Ragnarok's post credit scene and ends up with \"end of everything\". Right from the word go, every scene was intriguing,engaging and thrilling. Every superhero in the movie has got their own space to showcase their powers and skills, you will scream for every scene, I promise, even if you are not a fan of a particular superhero, you will surely scream for their elevations. There are many sacrifices in this movie which are quite emotional and they are so meaningful. Even the mad titan himself has to sacrifice something to gain something. Thanos is not just a villain, he has his own character which has a lot of emotional depth. You will feel sorry for him in few moments which causes so much pain to him. His life, his children, his sacrifice and his goal everything means so much to him. He also respects his opponents even though they took out the blood from his face. Thanos says \"I hope they remember you\" to Tony, this scene is just awesome and you are gonna love it for sure. Josh Brolin is spectacular in Thanos role, he completely nailed it. Thanos' adoptive children Cull Obsidian, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive helps him to fill the infinity gauntlet with six infinity stones. They also had few outstanding moments in this movie. There will be a heartbreak in the first 5 minutes of the movie, so, one should not miss the beginning. Heimdall's uses bifrost one last time to save Hulk and succeeds by the way. The scene in which Bruce Banner warns Dr. Strange by saying \"Thanos is coming\" is striking. Dr. Strange seeking help of Tony Stark is an another moment to cherish by Marvel fans. Scenes involving Peter Parker, Tony Stark and Stephen Strange were remarkable.\nThe entrance scene of Steve Rogers is breathtaking, Captain, Widow and Falcon rescues Vision and Wanda Maximoff from Midnight and Glaive. And also the scenes involving Thor, Rocket, Groot, Mantis, Gamora, Drax, Star Lord were picturesque. The king, Black Panther opens the door for the trouble and evil, he never hesitates to help \"all of them\", even if Wakanda destroys, he wouldn't care because he is the king.\nThe entire action sequences pictured in Wakanda and Titan are jaw-dropping. Climax of the movie will leave you baffled and so was the post credits scene involving Maria Hill and Nick Fury. That was the best time to call \"Captain Marvel\" to the scenario. Be prepared for the heartbreaks in the climax, they were too emotional.\nOn the whole, Avengers: Infinity war is a movie which will be cherished and remembered for a long time, like even for few decades or so. Infinity war is nothing short of an epic. A masterpiece. MARVEL-ous one from the Marvel Studios. I'm not going to disclose spoilers in my review, just go and experience the epic. We have to wait until May 3rd, 2019 to see how the mystery unfolds. Just 1 more year, we can wait as we have more Marvel movies coming this year and the next. There are few exceptional scenes like,\n1) THANOS' character development and his emotional side. \n2) Soul stone sequence.\n3) Reality stone sequence.\n4) Entire action episode in Wakanda.\n5) Action sequence on TITAN.\n6) Dr. Strange's magic and all of his scenes are extraordinary.\n7) Iron Man's battle with THANOS.\n8) Thor's scenes with THANOS, all his scenes were executed very well. He is god of thunder man.\n9) Captain and Groot introducing each other.\n10) Guardians with Tony, Peter and Strange( So much fun).\n11) Dr. Strange's sacrifice for the life of Tony Stark.\n12) Rocket's funny conversation with Bucky.\n13) Hulk in the Hulkbuster. \n14) Loki says \"We have a hulk\" to THANOS\nAnd there are many more to experience. What you saw in trailers and TV spots are just 5% of the movie and rest will be on screen. Go for it. Do not miss it. Avengers Dies. Avengers Lives. Avengers will return.", "You know it when the lights dimmed\nThe struggle happens\nit all felt alive and you just can't focus on anything else", "This movie held no punches. It immediately started taking away characters fans have admired for a very long time. But this is what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building up to for 10 years. They have blessed fans with unique characters played by remarkable actors, and this story would tell the world that good things don't last forever. At least that's what I expected. The movie took me but surprise when they took away characters we have just started to love. The movie slowly built up to the final battles between good and evil. That is when I expected them to put an end to the original line-up, but they didn't. They knew exactly what the audience was going to expect, so they gave us the opposite. This movie made me sad, angry, and happy. I laughed, and cried. The movie was full of reunions, and introductions between characters. And Thanos is by far one of the most complex villains I've ever seen in a Marvel movie. Even if the ending was the opposite of my expectations, the movie reminded me why I spend my money on these movies. Why I anxiously wait for the next movie to come out. They know how to make their fans feel every single emotion, and in the end, that is truly what good movies do.", "I left the theater like \" no! No! It can't be!!\" No spoilers here, but oh my goodness what a film! I was literally on my seats edge. There are so many questions I need answering now. Even with the going in and out of scenes it all stayed together, it was very cohesive. Just crazy good.", "WARNING, SPOILERS!\nThe latest Avengers film is possibly the best, or near the same level of greatness as the original Avengers, and far superior compared to Age of Ultron.

Too much time wasted on Falcon and Widow. There is no way Widow could fight the black order. I mean really why are they even in the movie. So glad hackman was not cast. Why is Vision so weak. He holds a Stone. I thought Dr. Strange could do more. Nit picking. But really WHY NO HULK. Hulk vs Black order would of topped it off. Again GREAT MOVIE would of been a 11 if it had the Hulk and no Ruffalo.", "What a show! The characters are all amazing...the feeling of enormous impact is totally palpable throughout the movie...the comedy is on point and Thanos is quite possibly the best MCU villain ever! I cannot wait for the next (and mostly final) part...Bring it on MCU! Totally ready for it!! Amazing spectacle", "Ever since July 2017, I've been anticipating this movie. Today, April 27th, I saw it. Every second of this movie had me completely shocked!\nMarvel is brilliant with every idea they come up with. Joe and Anthony Russo are so smart and they did everything the way it was supposed to be. This movie will leave you with many questions, but it will leave you wanting more. Not to mention, Thanos is the strongest villain the MCU has ever had. He's actually...Charismatic. Every single part of this movie made a Marvel fan gasp. It's THAT good. With every character that's been introduced in the MCU has a huge part in it. That's what I love about it. Go see this movie, you won't disappointed about anything. It is the best superhero movie of all time.", "After watching every movie in the franchise (some more than once) in the last two weeks, I thought I was ready for this. \nI wasn't. \nI went to the Thursday night showing as I do with all of these movies, and it was packed.\nPeople were clapping as different characters made their appearances, gasped at the same times, laughed at the same the same moments; it was a great experience.\nI was blown away with this movie. It was everything I wanted it to be, and more. \nLots of theories are going to be happening following the ending...and even more after the final credits. \nI thought about the movie all day today, and bought a ticket for tomorrow...just to see if I missed anything!\nGo see this movie!\nCan't wait to see how Captain Marvel and now Ant Man and The Wasp fit in now...that it appears they need some help.", "I've been following the MCU since it began. Seen every movie many times and trust me when I say this is the best of them. I might be biased because of this but it lived up to the hype.", "Well i diddn't expect something different .a Brilliant movie with Awesome Villain and Great humor .it totally lives up to The hype", "From the beginning of the movie, I knew that this was going to be a hell of a movie. This movie begins with Thor and Hulk's ass being handed to them, defeating 2 of the heavy hitters, giving us a statement: Thanos does not, and I mean DOES NOT mess around and he has no mercy. Hulk is teleported away by Heimdall, and Thanos kills him in retaliation. Shortly after, Thanos demands the Tesseract from Loki, which he is reluctant to give. Thanos threatens to kill Thor if he doesn't receive the Tesseract. Eventually, he gives it up and reveals that a stone lies within the power cube. Thor is subdued, Loki begins to act and tries to kill Thanos but unfortunately, Thanos has now the power of 2 Infinity Stones and easily stops Loki. Commenting about his fake deaths and his power in mischief, Thanos gruesomely kills Loki, sealing his death. Thor is left to mourn his brother and his people, afterwards Thanos destroys the ship and leaves Thor to die. \nAll throughout the movie, the characters interact with each other and its nearly perfect how they talk and work together to produce such an amazing team. In a Lord of the Rings sort of way, 3 stories occur, 1 group on Earth, 1 chasing after Thanos and 1 making a weapon that can kill Thanos. In the eve of all the situations, 2 battles occur, one against Thanos, and one against his army and minions/children and those who were making the weapon (Thor, Groot and Rocket) join the battle on Wakanda. Meanwhile, the battle against Thanos reaches a point where the group is able to subdue him, Star-Lord unfortunately learns of Gamora's death and hits Thanos breaking the connection the group has subduing Thanos, with Spider-Man almost removing the Infinity Gauntlet. To our disappointment (in terms of good side winning), Thanos defeats the group and comes close to killing Iron Man but Dr. Strange cuts a deal, Thanos spares Stark and Strange gives the Time Stone to Thanos. \nIt comes to rise. One final stone to retrieve, Thanos has 5 and is near invincible. He travels to Wakanda via space portal. The final stand is now here. Everyone with the will to fight tries to stop Thanos but no one can stop him, not even Captain America stopped him, and in return, receives a kick-ass sucker punch from Thanos. It comes to a close, all that lies between Thanos and Vision is Scarlet Witch, and she comes to a hard decision and destroys the Mind Stone (is that even possible? awesome!) and its all over. Thanks however has the Time Stone and is able to reverse time where he revives Vision and rips the Stone from his head, killing Vision. At last, he puts the final Stone in the Gauntlet and with that, he is truly powerful, powerful enough to wipe out half the universe with the snap of his fingers. But WAIT, THERE'S MORE! Thor comes to the rescue and throws his bad-ass axe towards Thanos, nearly killing him at an instant. But as I said, nearly killed him. Thanos snaps his fingers and the goal is completed. Shortly, half the Avengers and nearly all the Guardians die, even Spider-Man fades away, leaving the team and the audience grief stricken.\nThis movie is truly a great movie, it shows us that heroes don't always win and that sometimes, our emotions and mistakes can get in our way. From all the movies in the MCU, this is the only one (and probably the only one) that has the bad guy win and had him decimate half the freaking universe. Some people may say this ending was expected or cheap, or maybe thats just what the MCU needed, a ending where the good guy doesn't always wins and sometimes evil triumphs over good. This movie is the most anticipated movie of all time because its the cumulation of everything we seen and end it in a way we've never seen in the MCU.", "This movie is amazing. Best movie ever. There was a lot of hype for this movie and it was not over hyped at all. This was an awesome movie. It's so amazing and I can't say enough about it.", "Wow\u00a1\u00a1, nuff said\nI do not give a 10 cause you can not rate a superheroe movie with a 10", "Avengers: Infinity War is latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they have taken an unbelievable and daring step with this movie. \nKevin Feige and The Russo Brothers have cooked up a masterpiece, which will keep you at the edge of your seat, and when you least expect, it will send you into a state of denial.\nAn amazing quality of this movie is how unpredictable it is, and what an amazing job Marvel did and keeping the plot a secret until the release, by handing out fake scripts to the actors and whatnot. \nThe special effects, and the CGI in this movie were better than any other movie of the MCU, nothing at all seemed unrealistic (except Proxima Midnight at certain parts of the movie.)\nAnother one of the best things about MCU's latest installment is that although it will be a completely different experience for Marvel fans (people who've watched the movies, who read comics and in a nutshell, know everything one's supposed to know for Infinity War) compared to people who're just watching the movie for the sake of watching such a hyped release, it'll still be pretty amazing for those non-fans. Because they've made the movie in such a way that even a person who knows very less will understand what's happening.\nAnother amazing thing was how they portrayed Thanos. They did it the right way. They made us see his emotions, his reasons for being a genocidal purple egg. MCU has done great with their villains in their past two installments; Thanos and Killmonger. With Hela they didn't really get into depth. And they didn't really show Hela as a person, they just showed her as a mad woman killing for fun and a hunger for the throne and power. But with Thanos and Killmonger, they showed us what they went through to have these motives and aims. They didn't show them as madmen, they showed them as people. Normal people, with normal thought processes, and the ability to feel, which in my opinion is the best thing you can do with a villain; make them as human as possible.\nNow we get to the quality every MCU movie has; the humor. I think this might be the best Stan Lee cameo for me. And having this ambitious a crossover is difficult, very difficult infact, but they used humor to make the characters go together perfectly. Tony Starks sarcasm, Peter Parker's movie references, Thor not knowing what to say where and Star Lord's (hilarious) narcissism all mixed in perfectly acting as comic relief scenes. \nAnd the last of many qualities of this movie; the daring step and breaking the cliche. This movie is not like every other superhero movie, I repeat, it is not like every other superhero movie. It's the biggest Cinematic Event in the history of cinema. And that is for a reason, not just a very grand cast, but an amazing storyline. If you have seen it, you know what \nI mean, but if you haven't....then I guess you will.\nAs Thanos wants things \"perfectly balanced\", that's what they did with this movie; humor, action, climax and emotion blended into a perfect balance. \nOne of the best movies of the 21st Century, for me.", "Okay, misanthrope alert! In the case of Avengers: Infinity War, I found myself actually rooting for Thanos more than the Avengers. It seems Thanos is the only one who realizes that there are too many people and is actually doing something about it. No that I have that off my chest, what about the movie? \nAs with the rest of the Marvel Universe films, there is no shortage of action and all your favorite characters are there. In that respect it feels like Pasta Puttanesca: You throw in whatever you have in the cupboard. And, for those of us who have not been totally sucked into the storyline, CNN has produced a good summary and timeline to help decipher the nuanced hints of what was to come in Infinity Wars. \nThe writers have done a good job of interweaving the various storylines together, no mean feat, to keep those who, such as myself, have not followed the story arc over the pat 10 years. Visuals, as yo would expect are stunning, and the hand-held photography is kept to a minimum so as not to induce vertigo!\nInfinity Wars certainly raises some major questions about what is to come. I mean how can you eliminate that many key figures and keep the franchise alive? But then, Thanos does have the time infinity stone, so who is to say that time won't be reversed. After all this is fantasy. \nThe Marvel franchise is getting long in the tooth and personally, I lost much of the wide-eyed anticipation long ago. But Avengers: Infinity Wars does a lot to bring back the enjoyment of the franchise and left me with a \"Say what?\" at the end.", "The title says it all Great action \nFunny as HELL\nGreat villain \nA great ending", "To truly appreciate this movie, you need to look at it from Thanos' perspective. As messed up as his methods are, when you look at Earth from his perspective with how the fate of his planet was, you can see his point. \nLook at it from his perspective as the good guy and our chosen heroes as the bad guys and it plays out as a great action film with an awesome amount of humour and action with it. \nThat is what made this film brilliant.\nIt also makes me wish that Thor and Rocket had met years ago.", "If you're not a fan of the MCU or Marvel you'll be losing of the best of experience you could ever have at the cinema. The Russo Brothers made a masterpiece. The best movie in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. \nRight off the bat, the movie starts with a lot of power and engages you immediately, there's time to breathe during the first half with a joke here and there but after that hour has passed, the tension just keeps on building and it doesn't break even after the movie has ended. \nJosh Brolin was an amazing Thanos, as he nails the role so perfectly. Always the most overpowering, intimidating and fear-provoking character in the room. This is the first time you can feel that the Avengers are going to have a struggle finishing their task and lose some of their integrants knowing they have to give it their all due to what there's at stake.\nEvery single actor in this movie (Downey Jr., Cumberbatch, Holland, Ruffalo, Olsen, Johansson, Pratt, Bautista, etc.) does their respective character so well and the outstanding dialogue just makes it that much better of a performance. Got to give props for the Russo Brothers at how they manage to handle every single Avenger sufficient screen-time without leaving us needing more or less of one superhero with already an enormous cast.\nOne of the things I loved and hated about this movie was ending. The finale was such an amazing part of the story. You literally cannot know what's going to happen after the events presented in this film which makes it that much better.\nAll and all, this has become one my favorites. Definitely going to watch it again at the theater and must say to you for you to do so as well. Probably a movie we won't ever get again in years to come.", "First off 10/10 it's also probably the first and last 10/10 ratings I will ever give a movie. I don't hand 10s out like candy it has to be better then good this review while most haven't watched it contains no real spoilers as of yet. Here we go with some notes you gotta stay for the ending scene after credits that combined with Dr. Strange and Tony convo you need to pay attention to what they are talking about it has everything to do with the way the movie ends. It's not the ending and the end scene with fury the message is sent to alert someone we haven't seen in marvel movies yet. There were very little mistakes if any maybe gripes or people who don't understand or follow everything cause they don't read comics or watch marvel movies. The action in the movie is well thought out and top notch so are the jokes. This movie is meant to play on your emotions leave you guessing even though the movie is pretty complete on it's own. Some people gripe the CGI was sketchy at parts. I would disagree but also if you payed for 3D I bet it would be a lot better then you think. I may go see it again just for that reason this is a good movie to see in 3d. Yes people die it is meant to show how strong Thanos is he already has 1 stone at the very beginning of the movie so that adds to his strength. Thanos and the man who played him (Josh Brolin) is as good as any joker or guy who played him dead or alive. All of the people who played hero's were top notch even if they never play in another movie again this movie is enough to polish any r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It's not a money grab it's a masterpiece. A true Marvel. Go see it.", "Now, Marvel has already proven over the last decade that they can really keep surprising us and drwing us into the theatres to watch more and more of their movies. But surprises fall utterly short when it comes down to this movie. This movie doesn't surprise you with just a twist scene or an event, it surprises you with its tone. Holy Hell! From the first SECOND of the movie, literally, you could tell it's gonna be a bloodbath and a heartbreak. Real stakes? These are stakes so real you'd wish they weren't. Action scenes? This movie gives you so much epic scenes you'd get lost after you walk out of the movie on which was your favorite! And the villain? GOD DAMN, Thanos is a menace! Not best marvel villain. But one of the best villains period. The movie balances action, sadness, comedy, goosebumps, and shocking events perfectly. Easily, the best MCU movie and definitely the best Superhero movie to date!!!", "I was curious to see how they can bring so many leading characters to one movie and make it work and let me tell you they did it. Plot holes from previous films were filled in the process of this action packed movie not to mention it was funny with great one-liners mixed with tragedy. This movie left me speechless after viewing it and all I could think was \"wow.\" This was an excellent movie that did the comic book some justice and was entertaining. This movie left me wanting more and I cannot wait to see what they will do next.  However, if this is your first Marvel movie (if you read the comics you would be fine) I think it might be hard to follow since there are so many characters and a lot of the development started from previous movies and there was a lot of information involved that may have made it difficult to understand the storyline. I only mention this because there were a few people in the theater that never saw any of the movies prior to this and were confused about the characters and about the details for the storyline.  Excellent movie! I can't wait to watch it again and to see the next film.", "Best movie ever. If u have seen it, u know exactly how I'm feeling. If u haven't seen it, GO SEE IT! Best movie!", "The movie was ok for fans and teenagers or so but i consider it to be very cliche. It tried to be funny, rarely made me smile a bit, stupid catchphrases. Lots of camera cuts, hard to observe the action, lots of CGI.\nThe good part was the last 30-40 minutes of the film when that shocking and sudden ending appeared and left many of us waiting for the part 2 already and maybe some considered to be a dissapointing one. The plot was ok, liked the new villain, it looked like worthy of the avengers and not like the previous two films. An overpowered villain with a super weapon. \nMany people(including me) hoped and was sure that somebody is going to die... well most of the characters perish and the villain actually wins. Overall i think this movie will be a succes and that all the stupid cliche catchphrases compensate with the action and the massive gathering of marvel heroes", "This movie outdoes all expectations. It perfectly gives you all the different feels of the marvel cinematic universe within one movie. Balances humor, action, drama, suspense, and wonderfully adds surprise as well. To fully understand and experience the 10/10 rating I give it, you MUST watch all the movies. This will help you understand what led up to this, and have the feeling towards each character within the movie. Simply one of the best movies this generation will see.", "What do we expect and has always experienced from Superhero movie is one or at max two climax, but this is not some normal superhero movie, this is best SuperHero and Marvel movie.\nThere will be no spoilers in this review so sit back and read it without worrying of spoiling your movie.\nI believe the way they build up Thanos story and story of stones couldn't be done in better way. The movie is above expectations and worth the hype all around the internet and world. \nCharacters were not just for the sake of being in a movie but the characters actually had a part. Not to mention the way movie started already build up so suspense and intrigue that I didn't even went off for drinks during interval, because I cant miss a single detail. The end of the movie was great its just that I this time I am intrigued for ONE year.", "I've been following the Marvel Cinematic Universe from the start and I couldn't have been more impressed and satisfied with Infinity War. Enough has been said.", "What can I say good that has not already been said by a few people on here. The Russo Brothers from CleveLAND Ohio have created a movie I could watch 20 times and never get bored of. Well Done Joe and Anthony. Am so looking forward to 1 year from now when that untitled movie rolls along. Keep on making great pictures like this, thank you for this Mega-Epic story with all the elements mixed in.", "I have just watched \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and I feel inspired - the wait is over! Amazing characters, epic action scenes, you will laugh, but you will also cry. It was great to see my favourite Guardians of the Galaxy together with the Avengers - \"I am Groot\" followed by \"I am Steve Rogers\". Thanos is surely the best Marvel villain - so powerful and emotional. He begins the whole action with a short fight with Hulk - I think this is a good introduction and all people can easily understand how strong he actually is. The fans lose Heimdall and the iconic Loki - the death of our favourite villain was so tragic especially after his great line (\"We have a Hulk!\").  The film is surely well developed and people can follow different stories - Thor, Tony Stark and Peter Quill lead the storyline. I expected more from Captain Rogers, Black Panther and Bruce Banner, but they seemed to be only supporting characters. Parker and Strange did great job together with Iron-Man, while the Guardians were having hard time against Thanos on Knowhere. I love the relationship between Gamora and Star-Lord and their scene against Thanos was one of the best in the movie - sad, strong, great. Gamora has to be back in the next movie, I really need her in this situation.  The battle on Titan was the best in the whole MCU - they were so close!!! The battle in Wakanda was good, but the fight between Iron-Man and Thanos was on the highest level. You need to watch this movie, I am planning to do this once again!", "One of the best you'll see this year. Amazing movie.", "Alright let's get something straight, to anyone rating it bad because it was all over the place and it was too funny, THERE ARE OVER 60 MAIN CHARACTERS OF COURSE ITS GONNA BE ALL OVER THE PLACE the Russo brother did a magnificent job on getting all characters into the movie first off but every character got 5 minutes or more of screen time which is incredible considering if all characters got 3 minutes individually, the movie would be 3 hours long of just characters appearing. Next if you think it was too funny, you clearly have never seen a marvel movie ever, they all are supposed to be hilarious, well maybe not captain America but still no one with common sense would want a MARVEL movie with little hilarity, and if you didn't realize, DRAX STARLORD IRONMAN ROCKET GROOT ARE ALL IN THIS MOVIE SO HOW COULD YOU NOT EXPECT HILARITY, clearly you have no sense of humour. Lastly if at the end you were like \"NO why would you do that, end the mcu like that, this movie sucks\" you do realize there is a second part coming out in 2019? Also if you get emotional (being any emotion except boredom) , then the movie did it's job, what you except to go into a movie and sit there and not feel anything and walk out with nothing happened? Point of a movie is to make you feel something anything except boredom it's called escapism.  Now for the short review part.\nThis movie will play with your emotions like thanos plays with the avengers, right from the beginning to the end, if you've never watched a marvel movie or don't know any marvel characters then go home and binge watch all of them before going to see this. I've been watching the MCU for 10 years and this is the greatest Movie they've produced, the greatest special effects I've ever seen. I recommend going with your friends or even taking your family out to see this movie (it maybe rated PG-13 but that's means nothing it's basicslly an exceptional mark or something, I watched avengers in 2012 when I was 10 so your kids are good). I hope infinity war beats avatar in the box office and maintains an above nine reading one of the greatest movies of Everseen highly recommend to go see this movie.", "Wow this movie was insain!! The caracter has so evolve!", "As a comic book fan, and lover of all superheroes, I had somewhat low expectations for this movie. I assumed it would be just fine. How wrong I was. It was completely unexpected, intense, and a complete emotional roller coaster. Although it had several flaws, they were minor and didn't take away from the story. I believe there's a new generation of filmmaking on the horizon, complete with ultra-realistic, virtual-reality graphics, and this movie packs a punch in that department.", "After 10 years we finally get the movie we all wanted! The Russo's do not let it fail, it's funny, serious and lovable. No short cuts all the build up was real. I couldnt be happier!", "Wow what a thrill ride. This sets the new standard on comic book movies", "After 10 years the still surprise us\nGood plot amazing actors \nAnd of course huge suspense \nThe hype for the next one is real !!!", "I wait for this from 27 Jan,2017 Since the shoot was stared.i see it today i can't explain how really it great but climax makes me wait for 1 year.Thanos was very crusial with emotional villain and did wonderful job by josh brollin.Wanda Ane Specially Thor Have amazing power inside movie.You will be shocked after you watch this if you are die hard fan of Marvel just like me.", "A day after and the movie keeps playing in my mind. Best Marvel movie ever. Thanos was the best villain ever existed on screen. Speechless audience at the end of the movie stack in their seats wondering what just happened..", "I am overwhelmed after watching the movie. It's Epic in every aspect from action,CGI,story and dialogues. Its a True Marvel masterpiece. I am very impressed that how perfectly Marvel fixed their villain problem. Thanos is unlike any other villain avengers ever faced. Movie also delivers some bewildering surprises.The movie is very emotional too but again marvel put some solid humor in the movie. Action scenes are 20 times of 'Civil War'.Over all its best movie of MCU. Eagerly looking forward what next gonna happen because the ending is killer one.", "Everyone left the theater with their jaws on the floor. By the end of the film the entire audience was dead silent and in awe of what we'd all just watched and been through. This movie pulls no punches and delivers hit after breathtaking hit. What's really amazing about this movie is at no point does the viewer feel numb to the onslaught. It's a perfectly balanced movie and does not disappoint at any moment. Now of course the premise of the sequel is made pretty obvious but that's completely forgivable. If I do have one beef it's that Ant-Man and Hawkeye were supposed to be in the film but were only mentioned by name and never seen. Paul Rudd even did press for the movie but he wasn't actually in it. The scale of this film is incredible. It feels epic but still has great character development as well. One of my favorite aspects was seeing Dr. Strange do more actual magic instead of just portals and mystic shields. The ending is absolutely devastating but so perfect. Wear your brown pants to this movie; you'll need them.", "Even though it's not perfect, I must say that AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR totally delivers all you want from a MARVEL movie. It gives you: the characters you love, the villain you've been waiting for and, of course the action sequences you've been craving like a fist-shaped bar of MARVEL-brand chocolate! We ALL should know by now that Joel and Anthony Russo+ MARVEL MCU= greatness and INFINITY WAR proves that fact yet again! Overall it's a pretty cool and fun ride, but you certainly have to prepare yourself for typical superhero silliness. However, the silly superhero stuff is told in a mature, non-patronising way and it wasn't like the rest of the of the frankly \"daft\" superhero films of the past year. Yes, I'm talking about you, THOR: RAGNAROK, SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, BLACK PANTHER and GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL 2. Though INFINITY WAR is certainly NOT realistic at all, it grips and has a serious tone that keeps you watching. The script is dynamic but also very funny in some parts and we get a good look at MOST of the characters. The plot is simple and nothing THAT new or fresh but it still grips and provides real closure on the already rather over-bloated MARVEL cinematic universe. There were a couple of elements I wasn't QUITE sure on but more about them later. Firstly, the good things: the plot, the characters and action. The plot for the most part was really exciting and really had me gripped; it was serious and tense. However, it WAS a little dull in some parts. There were a few times when things lagged for a while but on a whole I was never really bored during this film. The main thing I was concerned about in this film was the amount of additional characters and how the film could easily become convoluted. Here's the thing: it didn't feel convoluted BUT, some of the characters do get sidelined. Some of your favourites like Captain America, Black Widow and Black Panther were kind of pushed out into the background and though they featured, they didn't feature as much as some (and me) would have liked. The story really focuses on three sectors: Thanos, Team Iron Man and Team Guardians. Everything else is really not that major. Now, on to the action. The action in this film was quite frankly AWESOME! After all, these are the directors behind the elevator and airport fight scenes in the Captain America films 2 and 3. The battle for Wakanda plays out like a completely OTT version of the battle of the Pelennor Fields from LOTR 3 and once the infamous AVENGERS score kicks in, you know you've got a good thing going!  Now, on to the acting! Almost ALL the members of the cast are great and give it their all! Some of these characters may not get all that much to say but they're all well-acted. However, I REALLY wasn't sure about the movie's main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin). I must admit I found Thanos (as a character) rather bland. You certainly realise what a threat he poses to the Avengers but really, he's a purple Darth Vader who's not THAT interesting. Brolin's performance is strong as the genocidal maniac but there were times when Brolin simply read the script. Though the villain is something new, I don't see him as a cinematic villain that will stand out! On a whole, the film was fun, action-packed and gripping but it's nothing REALLY new and as my Dad so rightly said: \"once you've seen one; you've seen them all!\" The conclusion was devastating and raised many, many questions and the after-credits scene was certainly interesting even though it wasn't really worth waiting for. Definitely a fun ride but I couldn't really say that \"this... Does bring a smile to my face\"...", "This movie was worth the ten years it was exactly how i wanted it.It was very tearful as well", "I have waited for so many years for these amazing marvel characters to finally work together and kick some ass. Every single fight scene was pure perfection. I was just filled with so much happiness watching these superheroes fight together. You really can't ask for anything else. FINALLY marvel has made a villain on the big screen that is actually good. Thanos is one of my favorite villains after heath ledgers joker. You see exactly just how powerful he is and crazy he is. They also bring out his emotion side for a brief minute which is something I never saw coming. He is just amazing. And the comedy!! I would give the comedy a 10. You can tell that they aren't just jokes they added in at the last minute just to add it. Seeing Tom Holland being so happy just to be there was so good you can just tell how happy he is. He and tony stark are still like father and son, and they work so well together. All the characters get enough time in the movie so they don't just feel like they were put there just because they can and it'll make them money. I will worn you however, the ending will either make you hate it and infuriate you or you'll understand just why the Russo brothers did this. You might have to take a day to process what just happened but if you understand that the ending isn't a bad thing but kind of a work of art. I give a nine because of the ending and because there are those moments when they just feel a little long and you want to see thanos punch someone in the face but they really didn't bother me that much. So, in conclusion, this is my all time favorite marvel movie and I'm gonna see it like another 4 times at least while still in theaters. I'm still just amazed on how phenomenal this movie was and that we finally get the cross over we deserve and that it is definitely not a giant flop like justice league was. AWESOME movie.", "Really loved this movie, i did not expect to be such a wonderful one. Loved Josh Brolin as Thanos, which made Marvel movies incredible.", "I don't recall any movie that had as much hype as Infinity War. I mean, it's the culmination of 10 years worth of work. That being said, I expected to be blown away, and I was. This movie delivers on such a magnificent level, there really isn't an adequate amount of words that can be said about it. It does an exceptional job of connecting the Avengers, the Guardians, and the citizens of Wakanda in a way that only a Marvel movie can. A fantastic film from start to finish that was shot beautifully, the only thing that may keep me from seeing this tons of times was the ending and how hard it was to see those particular characters disappear into the Soul Realm. The action was breathtaking, and I even openly screamed a couple of times, something I don't do in movies. I do want to applaud the Russo brothers for being able to deliver shocking twists to fans who have been around for 10 years and having the guts to kill (and supposedly kill) as many, and THE characters, that they did. I can't say enough good things about this movie, but I'll end with this: it was, far and away, the best movie, superhero or not, that I'v ever seen.", "Many years have passed and many films have come until this time comes. Did it deserve it? For sure. AIW is not the perfect movie, but it's definitely in the highlights and Top 3 of Marvel's Cinema Universe. Russo found the right trick to harmoniously distribute the film between 23 characters and a titanic evil, with beautiful visual effects (more than 10 studios worked on them), stunning action, humorous moments, emotion and a story that keeps you interested. The end will leave everybody with their mouth open and looking forward for the next part. Are you ready?", "It's been a day and I can say this movie was cinematic perfection. Seeing so many characters on screen, and how incredibly well this film was edited, it's honestly very impressive. Alan Silvestri delivered an amazing score that no other composer could have done, with a film this big. I say this as a huge Brian Tyler and Hans Zimmer fan. The Russo's have made a film that will be tough to top. I wish the film was three hours. Maybe Avengers 4 can satisfy my want. 10/10 for me based on what I said above. Can't wait to watch it a second time.", "Its my first review on imdb. I m from India.I had See this movie today...beleive me marvel gave its best movie. I like story telling. Action sequences are outstanding. If you love spiderman 2004, the winter soldier 2014 then this movie is a million time better than those movies.\ni love winter soldier. I don't love civil war but that is good movie..infinity war is stunning movie. No one can make movie like this other than Russo brothers....I don't know where bad reviews come from what people want. Last thing its not garbage like ultron movie and million times better than first one..Even Josh whedon can't make movie like this ever.", "The sheer scale of this film made me sceptical of it at first. I knew I was going to love it being a massive Marvel nerd, but I did have worries about it feeling a bit over-saturated and disjointed, given the huge number of characters. Thankfully, the Russo brothers have pulled this off in almost flawless fashion. Each story arc is seamlessly blended together, while we focus moreso on the impending threat of Thanos, than any individual hero's story. This gives this film an incredibly different feel to the formula that we've grown to expect from Marvel, in that the single most important character is the antagonist, which subsequently means that he gets more development than anyone else. This is a more than welcome change if you ask me, as it serves as a good counter-measure to the lack of great villains in the MCU. Brolin breaks the tradition with his portrayal of Thanos, a super villain to which we relate in ways, who's point we see and last but not least - who feels like an ENORMOUS threat to the entire universe that we love. Just how much of a threat is very well established in the opening scenes. As the film progresses it jumps from character to character, or rather group to group, as separate teams each have their own parts to play in the upcoming showdown. This in no way damages the story-telling, and the Russo brothers deserve a huge amount of credit for how they managed to keep it so coherent, despite the events taking place across multiple planets, at the same time. Stylistically it does what every great marvel film does, it mixes a perfect blend of humour and action, becoming more serious when it needs to be... in moments that become more and more frequent the deeper you get. This film will make you feel every emotion you could imagine, especially if you're already invested in the universe and it's characters. It's worth noting that the chemistry between some of the characters that we've never seen together is nothing short of brilliant! Doctor Strange and Tony Stark clash, as do Stark and Peter Quill, The Hulk has some hilarious moments and Thor, Rocket and Teenage Groot make for a highly amusing trio! There are bucket loads of cross-overs here, as expected, each and every one of which makes for seriously entertaining viewing! I don't want to include spoilers in this review, but this film takes what we've come to expect, laughs at it, and does the exact opposite. As the title states, it's been 12 hours (more than that now) and I still can't stop thinking about what I witnessed in the cinema last night. I don't think anybody will be quite ready for the way it ends. It will leave you begging for answers and questioning everything. Be warned, you may leave the cinema emotionally drained, but you will leave more satisfied than ever. I rated this 10/10 but I don't really think any movie deserves a perfect 10. This is a 9.5 for me. Easily top 3 Marvel films of all time. Potential candidate for the best, and definitely up there with the greatest superhero films of all time.", "Never have I ever walked out of an MCU film so surprised and speechless! The studio really outdid it with this one! Infinity War lives up to the hype in the most amazing way possible to the point it even lives beyond the hype. With a mixture of such a great sense of humor, which seems to be a common thing now for the MCU to the darkest toned segments you'd think it's a DCEU film (Yes I just said that). The ending is just honestly the greatest yet sudden gut punch, that one would never even come close to thinking about coming from Marvel, but that's what makes the film so great! It knows that it is taking risks but that's what a good film does, therefore what is brought to the audience's attention is the fact that no one is safe!!! Go WATCH INFINITY WAR!

Better than Avengers - amazing job by all involved!", "Okay people, i usually dont rate or comment on movies but i am going to...

An awesome culmination of 10 years and 18 films. I must say that Thanos was pretty badazz. I would venture to say the best villain in the MCU at this point, by leaks and bounds. I ventured as far as checking out some spoilers for the film because I was so snaxious and GLAD to find that almost most of that was false! The actual events in the movie were action-packed from the opening scenes. It was essentially a series of third acts. This movie is filled with surprises and great humor. Thor might be my favorite character after IW and Ragnarok. Now I can't wait to see it again, and to see the upcoming movies for the MCU. The next few years for Marvel/Avengers will be quite interesting.

I feel that it was an uneccessary change and I hope that they introduce his true purpose as told for decades of comics.\nI plan on seeing this a few more times in the theater to give my support for what has been a great bunch of fun for 10 years", "If you like Marvel movies, like I do, then this includes everything you'll love about Marvel, and something new, gravitas.

This movie is so hard to describe because that is how amazing it is, and you'll understand what I mean when you watch it...so watch it!!!", "I enjoyed Avengers: Infinity War much more than I had expected and was impressed that the film was as good as it was considering all the characters Marvel were including from all the other MCU films. Generally the film is well paced and the story is ok. A lot of what happened in Civil War seems to have been ignored and whilst the story is pretty simple it works ok, though if you think about it for a few minutes the plot holes do start to show but for the most part the film doesn't give you a huge amount of time to dwindle on what happened 5 minutes before, so it isn't a big problem.  The film is quite dark but does have Marvels normal amount of humour, particularly in the first half of the film. The action is handled generally very well and but like most Marvel films, it does become a bit of a CGI fest at times. The big thing with the film is getting the characterisation right. Thanos is given much more of an character arc than I expected, not just the normal evil villian we have grown used to with most of the MCU films. The other bad guys in the film feel much more throw away though and they don't really hold the threat that they really should. As for the good guys, it is really very much the norm, with each character conforming to their normal stereo type, not that this is always a bad thing.  The score is pretty forgettable but does a decent job. The effects are very good and the cinematography looks pretty nice. Overall I gave it a 7 but it is probably work a 7.5. I does everything pretty well and is well worth having a watch, particularly if you are a MCU fan.", "My overall review of Avengers: Infinity War is \"EPIC\" \nIt had the story line that it needed and also multiple aspects within the film from start to finish. It has the must needed action that everyone is desperate to see. And without a doubt you most certainly get that. It has such a drive throughout the film for Thanos to achieve his goal, but the Avenger and GOTG give a good game.\nIt has outclassed the previoud Avengers and gives you that better build up that everyone has longed for! That's having every superhero who's been on the screen put together. \nTo me that film was that good I could never get bored of it and I already want to go and watch it again a thousand times over. The story is that good that you can't help yourself from doing just that. \nI would advise all to watch this whether you aren't a fan or haven't watch the previous before.", "What a film such a good ending, can't wait to see the next one", "I don't know how they do it but they just keep getting better. They managed the bringing together of all the major characters really well. The CGI and special effects were awesome. The ending was on the edge of your seat stuff and has left me wanting the next instalment NOW!!  Bravo MCU. Bravo.", "I wasn't quite sure at first with them all in the same movie but they really managed to pull it off and it's probably the best Avengers movie I've seen yet and can't wait for 2019 for part two to be realeased as it was heart wrenching for me at the end and was left on a cliffhanger. But would definitely recommend to go and see it and would of quite happy re-wanted the film moments after it ended!!", "I walked into this movie knowing it would change the MCU forever, and I walked out with a sense of dread comparable to the feeling of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I didn't think Thanos would be such a formidable adversary, and that Earth's Mightiest Heroes, The Avengers would be able to stop him. Yet they proved no match for him. Ye score was so powerful. In most Marvel films, the score is forgettable and nearly blends in as just noise. However, Thanos' theme with the cello solo was very intimidating, yet graceful. Well done, Russo Brothers. Well. Done.", "Forget Civil War, forget Winter Soldier....\nBecause this will be the best super heroes of all time !! Too much epic, too much emotional\nGreat epic scenes make us can not stop claping our hand, so hyped !!\nAnd even the after credit make us feel hyped\nYes, she will be there, a new future for MCU Can not wait to watch part 2, and i will watch this again this weekend\nThank you Marvel !!", "Infinity war is a project so grand in its scale that you can't help but feel impressed that a decent, if not good movie came out of this. Its major flaws however, lie in the grandeur of the movie. The amount of characters and storylines in the movie muddle the waters and bring about heavy tonal inconsistencies and pacing issues. This also made each character less special and with less to do however this was masked with the cleverly thought out character interactions. The Core of the movie is in Thanos ( and a truly wonderful motion capture performance by Josh Brolin ) who does not disappoint and is given plenty of room to stretch and develop which makes for a compelling final act of the movie. The writing is also very sleek and tries it's hardest to make the first half flow smoothly but falls short. All in all there are some disappointments and let downs that keep this movie from reaching the level of \"A dark knight\" or even \"A winter soldier\" but the audacity to tackle such a challenge with the class and style it did deserves to be appreciated a and seen. Just an Opinion .", "Pure impact of action and adrenaline. Special effects are amazing and story line contains dramatic scenes and typical marvel humour at its best!  Guardians harmonize perfectly with the rest of the avengers.", "The 10 years of hard work, planning, and steadfast belief in their stories and movies have resulted in a catalog of superheroes movies that are not only entertaining, but resulting in a universe that has captured the imagination of the world.\nAnd Avengers: Infinity War is epic!\nIt delivers on its promise and then some more surprises. For a movie of this scale, it does sacrifice some plot development for pacing, but those who have been watching the MCU are familiar with all the characters and storylines that have converged to IW.\nAnd so the story jumps right in to the events immediately following Thor: Ragnarok.\nWatching this movie on Wednesday morning 8.15am in IMAX, I was blown away by everything I saw onscreen, feeling like I was reading a comic book like a kid again.\nAnd that is the feeling Marvel movies have given me. Especially when I see all my favorite superhero characters coming together to fight Thanos.\nThe Avengers were not prepared to fight such a powerful villain and because the Avengers have broken up after civil war, they lack the unity to make a strong defense against Thanos, giving him the upper hand.\nAnd when the closing credits rolled the audience were all silent and stunned, sitting in their seats for a end credits scene and then left quietly, probably going through the movie in their heads questioning what they had watched.\nThere's even more questions now, but looking forward to Avengers 4 in 2019.", "These directors managed to erase the lazy lack of build and character assassinations in Thor Ragnarok to deliver a spectacle worthy of the MCU. They have the ability, like with Civil War, of nailing the characters they direct and write for, with The Black Order outstanding and Thanos on a par with Darth Vader circa Episodes 4-6. Faultless.  I was literally shaking after the first 10 minutes with excitement, as - similar to the first Avengers - each scene just got better and better. And I am fully immersed and up to date with the comics. This film delivers and is faithful to the source material whilst creating its own stories.  I laughed, shed a tear, gasped and just nodded in endless appreciation for managing to live up to all of the hype and all of the expectations I had.  Thank you so much Russo's I only hope someone pulls Rian Johnson out of his cave, and shows him how a major film should be written and directed in a way that actually exhilarates the audience rather than leaving them with furious disappointment and sheer disgust.  10/10 for Infinity War. I'll be seeing this again and again. Awesome", "Since everyone likely to watch this has already seen plenty of Marvel Comics' superhero movies, let's keep this one simple, with a good news-bad news format: Good - More superheroes appear in this one than you could shake Thor's hammer at. \nBad - It's occasionally hard to keep track of who is using which power against which enemy or henchperson thereof.  Bad - It runs 2 \u00bd hours. Good - The action is so (dare I say?) fast and furious that it sure seems a lot shorter.  Bad - After all that time, the movie ends with a lousy situation, including some surprising deaths, just to set up a sequel.\nGood - Since the power to control time is one of the themes, maybe the sequel will undo some of the losses we witnessed in this one.  Good - Stan Lee's cameo comes early, allowing focus to remain on the main story. Bad - What could possibly be bad about a Stan Lee cameo? They're always nothing but degrees of good.  Good - Josh Brolin looks and sounds suitably menacing in the role of archvillain Thanos, while also showing more emotional layers than usual for the genre. Bad - The handsome Brolin, in full regalia, bears a shocking resemblance to Ron Perlman, which would be a serious loss of points on the old 1-10 scale if carried over to his real life.  Good - Wonderful comic touches from Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man/Tony Stark and the crew from Guardians of the Galaxy. \nBad - Much of the action occurs in such dark, ominous settings, creating the impression of DC Comics having invaded this universe. Even Darth Vader would have wanted to redecorate Thanos' spacecraft and environs top cheer the place up.  Bad - Dave Bautista's endearingly dense Drax is getting even dumber. Good - At least his form of stupidity is funny, unlike the same trend in the US Congress.  Good - Thanos' evil plot is to save all the planets in the universe that have become overpopulated by wiping out half of their populations in a single stroke. Since he offs them randomly, he thinks it's fair, making him the ultimate eco-warrior. Bad - See previous comment about US Congress, whose collective thinking is no better.  Good - Scarlett Johansson appears as Black Widow. Bad - She doesn't get enough screen time to display her lithe and lethal skill set to full advantage. Actually, the same pairing applies to lovable tree-creature Groot, but for very different reasons  Bad - The credits are really, really long. Good - The standard teaser after they finally roll past is worth the wait.  Good - Franchise fans (who, unlike me at the time, already know this isn't a one-and-done story line) should be delighted by the script and the overall quality of the production, including all the CGI vistas and mayhem. Go to the biggest screen and most enveloping sound system in driving range, since there's plenty of action worthy of those enhancements. \nBad - If you've not already seen a fair share of the zillion movies or read a bunch of the decades of comics featuring Thor, Spiderman, Iron Man and all the other characters converging to defeat this epic threat to the universe, don't start here. You'll be a stranger in a strange land.  In space, no one can hear you bond.", "This is what a great franchise supposed to be! \nI was afraid, soon will comes the day, when no one (except me, ofc.) ever again interested to watch any superhero comic adaptation on the big screen. But now I can still see a bright future of this genre. After I saw this epic space-symphony finally, I just wanna watch infinity times, again & again. :) Could tell more but want zero spoiler, let you discover the whole movie for yourself!\nIf you are fan of MARVEL movies, then definitely you will enjoy this real gem.", "You won't be disappointed! Infinity War is full on from the first few minutes all the way to the end. The movie was excellent the way all the major stars were featured and teamed up with their own individual missions. \nIf there's one thing and every only one thing that let's it down a little was when people died near the end the others hardly showed any emotion about it. By not doing so it didn't bring the shock and emotions to the audience to feel the loss, or not for me or my son.", "The Russo brothers have done it again. The movie was paced very well, with the directors giving us breathing room between action heavy scenes for emotional moments & character growth. The comedy was also on point. The to and fro between the characters were perfectly timed & executed. The only gripe i have with the movie is the absence of 2 key characters. I was initially worried that wakanda parts would be given too much screentime (as i am not a fan of the overrated plothole heavy black panther) thankfully the scenes in wakanda were few. The Space sequences involving Thor & the Guardians were very well done. And finally Thanos is the best marvel villain since Loki & Red skull, who also makes his long awaited return with a cameo. The ending was anticlimactic but in a strange way fulfilling too, With what has transpired, I'm hopeful that we'd not be visually & culturally tortured with a black panther sequel anytime soon. this movie has dethroned Winter Soldier & is now my 3rd most favorite superhero movie ever after The Dark Knight & Civil War. The best part why Avengers succeeded & justice league failed was because Marvel doesn't waste time with SJW nonsense in their movies. (Atleast not all of them). I give this 9/10 stars. Don't miss it!", "The entire movie causes the adrenaline to flow through your body, making the defining moments even more awe-inspiring. Probably the best movie in the MCU, and the Russo brothers made it as epic, awesome, and defining as every Marvel fan could've hoped for.", "Two Avengers movies where produced before this one. One crappier than the other. It had no nerve no nothing. It feelt like Harlem Globetrotters just winning easily over weak enemies.  Suddenly all the fun is over for in comes Thanos and now its deadly serious. This Titan has power beyond understanding and his goal is decimating all the universe population in half.  He is a scary enemy a determined and yet in a way kind of melancholic about his mission. He understands and even empathise with his enemies but it wont matter because he is on quest to better the universe. This is Thanos show and now the Avengers, spiderman, Dr Strange, Guardians of the galaxy and Black panthers Wakanda all fight him and they all find themself in a scary revelation. This story is not about them anymore. Its about Thanos. This movie is epic to say the least.", "It is. The best MCU movie, and my #1 favorite. This is something that I've never seen before in the MCU. It's well balanced between the humor and the seriousness. It made me tear up a lot, I'm pretty sure many others cried too. I got surprised so much that I was literally in shock, even after the credits start rolling. It's darker than any other ones. I am definitely satisfied with Avengers: Infinity War. Though maybe it will be hard to take in, I recommend everyone to watch it. Every Marvel fans shouldn't miss it.", "Most of people were excited for this movie(especially marvel fans),The question here,does It deserve this much hype?.The answer is absolutely yes.The movie have It all,you will be laughing in a moment then after few minutes you will be crying.The action scenes are amazing and epic.\nMost of all, what makes this movie unique,is the villain thanos.\nThanos is by far the best marvel villain or even the best villain of all superheroe movies I have ever seen,powerful and his goals are clear.Overall The movie is the darkest mcu movie untill now and easily one of the top 3 marvel movies", "This film should be impossible to get right. Gather over 30 characters from 17 other films, all helmed by different people with different visions, collect them and finish up the pay off that's been building for 6 years since our first glimpse at Thanos at the end of Avengers. The Russo brothers did it. They made it, and they made it spectacular. The action is satisfying, the character focus is laser precise, the story is taut with tension and a grounded battle against what is right, and what is necessary. Marvel has outdone themselves. Simply one of the best cinematic experiences of the century thus far. Detractors may point to under utilised characters, a reliance on CGI, and poorly timed humour, but when everything else is some of the greatest blockbuster action ever put to screen, to let those things bring it down would be silly.  If there was one gripe, it would be continuity. To fully appreciate everything in this film, you need to have seen Civil War, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2, and to understand those films you need to have seen the countless Marvel films before them too.  But for those who have seen it, for those who have followed Marvel over the last 10 years, here's to another 10. People call it oversaturation, I call it the biggest and greatest cinematic event to ever occur. Here's to you, Marvel, you've done the impossible. You kept the fans happy.", "Waw what a great movie.\nStory is maybe not extremely elaborated but the special fx definitely are, without being \"over the top\" (like Transformers for instance).\nThe only (very little) negative thing I found was the action scenes that were moving so fast that you couldn't see all the details of the shots. Just like there was too much blur on the images and you missed some things.\nBut this is pure nagging, as said in my first sentence: stunning movie, very big recommendation.", "Marvel did not disappoint at all.. and even exceeded my expectations. I was a bit worried before that it might get messy to fit all those heroes in one movie.. but the story and screenplay overall was brilliant. How the story went was bold .. and ignited more interest and anticipation on what's next for MCU. After getting out of the cinema, I wanted to scream how great it was and talk about it .. but it's too great of a movie to spoil it for someone else :).

So many errors film wise and just not a good piece of the MCU.", "The movie has many different storylines for different heroes and by the middle of the movie I kind of got lost why is everyone doing what they are doing. In Avengers 2 there were many storylines as well, but somehow they managed to make it more interesting there. \nThe movie started really well, it was cool to see dramatic moments when everyone was shocked that Thanos is coming, especially meeting with Mark Ruffalo and Tony Stark, but then that dramatism pretty much disappeared.\nAlso, this movie is very unrealistic even for a Marvel movie. I mean, wtf is with Iron Man suit, it can do literally anything now. Also Spiderman's multiple spider legs also are quite unrealistic, how can he move them like that? Also, Thanos didn't look as powerful as he is supposed to be. He got many different stones, but he was still vulnerable to the Avengers, but he is supposed to be pretty much invincible, he should just crush them, but avengers seemed invincible instead. Also each stone has it's own role and ability, but Marvel didn't really use it that much.\nAlso, some actors, such as Tom Holland (Spider Man) allegedly dies, but we already know that he has a contract for 3 more Marvel movies, so it was not dramatic for me at all, because it means everyone who died will somehow return.\nThis is the first movie ever that I have watch at 4DX theater and it was amazing experience. Unfortunately, something was just lacking in the story, thus I give it an 8.

It does jump around from place to place frequently, and I wish the plot had flowed better, but I was still able to follow what was going on. This has possibly the best villain in all of the MCU! Thanos is the Darth Vader of this franchise! He's the villain you love to hate and are genuinely afraid of. The actors bounce off of each other very well and the dialogue is as fast-paced and witty as we've come to expect from Marvel. While at times, it does feel like watching a bunch of video game cutscenes edited together, the movie is so enthralling that my first reaction to the credits (other than pure surprise for reasons I don't dare spoil) was \"It's over already?! It just started 20 minutes ago? What? It started almost 3 hours ago?! How is that possible?\" That's how much this film pulled me in! It's well worth the 10 year wait! It's amazing to see all these characters interact with each other! There are some really amazing shots and moments, which again, I won't spoil.

A job well done to the Russo Brothers and I can't wait to see Avenegers Endgame...they believe it'll top this...but I don't know how they could", "I am truly impressed with this movie and I thought that this one would have win an Oscar. I was especially blown away with Thanos and his Malthusian Theory. Although he was referring the all the population throughout the different universes, he has truly painted a factual picture about of life and the suffering of the population in planet Earth. I agree that it is a sad concept but his ideas and speech was very deep and quite concerning. Although I would not like to see half of the population get wiped away :D Thank you Stan Lee for your most remarkable creations and I sincerely hope you will rest in peace and will find comfort and joy in the heavenly stars above. :')", "That's all you need to know if you are an emotional person.

I grew up as a keen movie fan and this has continued into adulthood. I've enjoyed all the Marvel Universe movies to date, some more than others. Winter Soldier was a highlight, Civil War was great, but when I heard they were going to bring it all together, I must admit I thought it was going to be a bit messy - still enjoyable - but messy. I am happy to report that I was wrong. THIS is what I want from a night at the cinema! Bags of action, snappy dialogue, incredible special effects and most importantly, surprisingly ...heart. Every hero gets their moment and not in a rushed or crammed in manner. The set pieces are astonishing, the laughs fast and plentiful. Brolin is the best villain in The MCU to date, managing to be both hateful and sympathetic, sometimes in the same scene! As the fella once said, \"I may not know art but I know what I like\", well this will never win an Oscar for Best Picture, but I would rather watch this than La La Land or Moonshine any day of the week. I can't wait to see where they take this next. Bravo Marvel, bravo.", "This movie is perfect. All of Marvel's favorites coming together to fight the biggest threat the universe ever faced. There are a lot surprises throughout the movie especially the ending. I'm dying to see how Marvel wraps up the Avengers sequel in the next movies.", "The movie can be described as \"decent\" at its best. The movie fails in its length and use of CGI. I don't think there was a single camera shot that didn't include some kind of CGI. The acting was okay, but the humor was misplaced. It's time for the avenger movies to end.", "The story arc continues as \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" face Thanos, their most implacable and powerful foe yet, whose goal is nothing less than the elimination of half of the universe's denizens. To do this, he must acquire all six of the infinity stones, colourful MacGuffins with a complex metaphysical backstory - a plot device that allows for a series embedded stories involving subsets of heroes and villains. The story is quite good and relatively internally consistent, and the characters interesting and well worked out (although I have my usual suspension of disbelief problem with The Avengers somewhat asymmetrical powers: Black Widow knows martial arts and is a good shot, Thor is an immortal God who can fly though space and withstand the focussed power of a degenerating neutron star, yet both seem to get equal hero billing). Even the most heavy made-up (or completely CGI) characters have a lot of personality, especially (IMO) chief villain Thanos, emotionally-expressive Mantis, and my personal favorite: giant dwarf Eitri (Peter Dinklage). The script manages to hit a good balance of action/drama and comedy (tricky to do and often a weak point in the genre). The ending is a set-up for the next film, in which we can expect Captain Marvel to put in an appearance (perhaps a harbinger for the next generation of Avengers). Given the God-like powers of some of the heroes and the fact that Thanos can now control reality and time (always a convenient plot gimmick), pretty much anything could happen.", "I just love this movie.I watched it more than 10times", "After 5th time to seeing this movie, Im writing this review. Infinity War is not just a movie. It is a consequence of events in Marvel movies for 10 years. It is a huge responsibility to make a movie like this. Because it has to be a bridge of phase 3 and 4, considering MCU will be continued for years... Also this is a big comic book event and it has lots of characters. Russo Brothers and writers did a brilliant job on it. It is amazingly epic, it has action all the time, it might make you cry few times, it can make you extremely laugh, it makes you thrilled and surprised. Shortly, you feel a lot of emotions during Infinity War. Even if you didnt watch any marvel movie, it can blow your mind too. No doubt, it is absolutely one of the greatest comic book movies in history. Im counting days for Endgame.", "As the greatest threat the universe has ever seen seeks the six stones which allows him to decimate any living creature, the disassembled Avengers must do whatever they can, even if that means making the toughest sacrifices, in order to prevent Thanos from achieving his goal. This third installment in the Avengers franchise brings a different approach to the series. It gathers its very popular characters/superheroes and puts them in a situation they've never faced before. Threatened from multiple places and also working on multiple plans, their actions are now bound to bring drama, rather than joy. Thus, the much darker atmosphere this movie generates is a very welcome change at least from my point of view. We still get the awesome scenery and the deeply satisfying action sequences, but the drama which they tend to generate has a much bigger impact. We also get some laughs seldomly and even some interesting sarcasm which are a good addition to the film, but those are somehow expected from a Marvel movie. As you might have guessed by now, the plot represents the movie's greatest aspect. The way it unfolds and the way it generates such emotion is unique, thus you have to give it credit for that. The characters are very well known from the other Marvel movies so there isn't much to say about them, besides the fact that they keep their characteristics, both good and bad, and that they are very well played by their impressive and charismatic actors. It's needless to say that this movie's cast can easily impress anyone without even mentioning the title or the plot. The visual part is top-notch. You get such great CGI that you're eyes simply cannot believe what they are seeing. Everything is so well thought and implemented that you cannot avoid saying \"wow\" at least a couple of times. We tend to get accustomed with CGI and special effects these days, but the ones features here are simply extraordinary. In conclusion, it's so far the best movie which \"wears\" the Avengers name, bringing a new approach to the franchise while leaving plenty of room for a highly expected sequel thanks to its unpredictable but also very profound finale. It managed to impress in every single way so I give it full credit for that.", "This part was awesome in one word. Felt bad for climax when almost half of them were vanishing, but I think they all will come back in next avengers movie 2019 . Hope for the best", "The Russo's are geniuses. They did the impossible and gave enough screen time to a ton of characters who are crucial to the MCU as a whole.", "I was very surprised when I saw this movie. After the giant dumster fire Age of Ultron was, I was scared for this movie. But I was very surprised by this movie, it is extremely good. Acting was amazing on all fronts. Tom Holland literally killed it in this movie, incredible acting, truley deserving of the Title of Best Spiderman. Action was very interesting. We had Doctor Strange using his powers and the infinity stones led to very mind blowing visuals not only in action, but in other parts of the movie Humor was better in this movie. Most of them landed with gave me a real hoot, maybe 1 or 2 knee slappers, but the rest were just bleh. For Thanos, best villian in the MCU. Period. People will say that Killmonger is, but he wsa my favorite until I saw Thanos in this. They didn't make him forgetable like DC did with the weird titan dude(lol i forgot that dude's name) in Justice League, but they actually made Thanos into a villian you can relate with and maybe sometimes root for. They were able to have all of that above, plus make him a badass. This folks is the how to do a villian in a movie I respect the hell out of the ending. The ending has never made me more excited for a sequel to a movie in my life. If any movie is going to catch that goofy movie Avatar in the box-office leaderboard, Avengers 4 will be the movie to do it. But one thing that I don't like about htis issues is the actor's stupid mistakes and revealing future movies, indicating that the characters that died WILL come back and be in their respected future movies. What I didn't like: The Hulk and Starlord. They made the Hullk the biggest loser on the screen, maybe he'l have his momment in Avenegrs 4. Starlord was very depressing also, made into a giant copying dork taht just shows off the entire time.\nAlso some pacing issues between scene with all of the characters. You knew there would be pacing issues, but it''s something that has to be addressed. This movie was truley worth the 3-4 year wait for. And the hype for it matched the hype I got from the end of it. I'm giving it a 9/10. While this movie blew me away, there were still some issues that brought it down from a 10/10 that had to be addressed. Thanks for reading! :)", "If A$AP Mob and Pro Era joined together and became a new Wu-Tang Clan, that would be like this movie. The best thing about this movie is the sheer amount of superheroes that there are, and somehow it all works, and you get a good amount of screen time for (almost) everyone. The action is amazing, and the whole thing is great for comic book fans.", "1. Story brilliantly written and executed but some where things were not explained in rush\n2. Actors in particular josh brolin, Rdj, chris hemsworth are good\n3. Vfx are good but when looked in 3D somewhere it lookes blurred\n4. Humor is wel placed and not wasted\n5. Overall movie is good and outstanding in case of performance", "I never seen such powerful thor before...amazing entrance of thor makes thid movie to the height of mount Everest...love u thor keep this power and axe till my least breath", "Well, actually, Marvel Cinematic Universe has been doing good since 2008, when they released Iron Man. And till then, this movie was the best of all! I think, this movie has created it's own level. It's too much hard to create such an hype, make this the talk of the time and then serve even better than those! The only thing that disappointed me is Thanos! I thought I will see him as powerful as the comics but he wasn't actually like that. But it's ok, that was necessary for the movie. In comics we see characters like Doom, Galactus, Sentry, Living Tribunal but in that movie they were not present to stand against Thanos! So it was needed to reduce his power so that our heroes can do something. But it wasn't actually a problem. We got the chance to see how wise he is even without the destructive powers. This is how you should create a villain character, who has a strong will and a good heart. DC should learn a lesson from this, they should know that people won't accept villains like horrible stephenwolf. They should create something like the Ledger's Joker or bring on Darkseid! The movie was decorated with so much big events! Hulk couldn't become hulk again, Tony & Peter's new outfits, Gamora's death, resturn of the Red Skull, The Storm Breaker, Loki's death and then a lot of heroes went into the soul world by the snap! Full of enjoyment!! All the best wishes for the next movies!", "The Avengers, no matter which way you look at it is an incredible achievement. The 6th official entry in the MCU which was a multi million cinematic experiment 4 years and 5 previous Marvel films in the making for its eventual leadup of its iconic superhero characters became a critical and commercial success which pioneered the superhero crossover film, revived the superhero genre and rewrote pop culture in a way that is still being felt today even after its release nearly 7 years ago now. The overall genre and emotional tone of The Avengers along with every other modern Marvel movie with its near perfect blend between drama and serious storylines but with light hearted comedy and great action sequences. It's been able to get everyone together, not just the comic fans due to Marvel's now infamous MCU formula with its massively wide spreading and universal appeal to anyone who has any interest in Marvel superheros and being entertained by a light-hearted action comedy blockbuster which has proven time and time again to be right with every Marvel film since with the Marvel Cinematic Universe now becoming the highest grossing film franchise in history with over 1 billion dollars. Now with Infinity War out, the third and possibly final Avengers film. The formula is now starting to become tested. No Marvel film before Infinity War has really tried to be dark, but the MCU is changing and now after seeing the film and where it went emotionally and storywise and have no idea where it's going to go after the way it ended, which is good. Marvel has listened to fans complaints of how previous villains were not serious or intimidating enough and how no main characters have ever actually been killed off with the feeling that they might not ever come back, this movie changes all that. Infinity War is not predictable. It's surprising and entertaining in the first half, then it hurts you and leaves you cold. Thanos was an incredible and brutal in this film as was the type of villain that Marvel Studios really needed at this point and I think they did an incredible job with the character aswell as all the choices he made and all the things he did in this movie, he was a better villain than by any right he needed to be. His CGI was great as well. It's a lot harder to talk about this film in a review than you think, and what it means for the future of Marvel Studios apart from saying it's my favourite Comic Book film of the decade so far since The Winter Soilder and complete new milestone for Marvel. Not just for Marvel, but for Comic Book Films as a whole. The MCU will grow in new ways unlike ever seen before because of this movie, and I'm looking forward to seeing how Captain Marvel is going to do that. I have no idea what's going to happen next, I don't read the comics", "This was a high octane superhero film, and it was done beautifully and exceptionally well - and that's knowing the multitude of characters and storylines that had to be woven into this beast of an undertaking. As always, the Russo brothers and the cast and geniuses working behind the scenes delivered. They delivered something exceptionally human, and fantastically impossible. Watch it if you haven't already. Watch it again if you have. There's so much packed into every millisecond.", "Best movie of 2018. Best superhero movie to date. It will make you cheer, laugh, and cry. It will make you beg for more. It would be hard to get every superhero involved, but they found a way. This is one you simply can't miss.", "The action and the effects were all first class.\nThe story line was filled with holes and questions. For an action packed movie it was awesome but it didn't offer very many intelligent twist.\nThanos wasn't the cool hearted killer I was led to believe from the other movies, he was calm and focused. Most of the aggression can from the Avengers. Even Dr Strange tossed out civility and went straight to violence. At the end of the movie I found myself asking the question, \"Who were the real villains here?\"\nI enjoy fantasy movies and this one is good enough to watch again but only for the action and effects, the writers left out a lot of info that would justify the violence of the Avengers but hey, that's Hollywood.", "Looked forward to watching this and was not disappointed.", "The first half was almost a masterpiece but later on, it started to drag and the second half was like every other Marvel movie with a not very exciting showdown. I wish they'd keep their movies at 1h 45mins max and scale back the boss battle or do something new because the formula is starting to bore me. That being said, I found the telekinetic bad guy at the beginning more intimidating and interesting than Thanos. I had the time of my life the first half, the second half was good and even though the ending was different, it's painfully obvious that it doesn't matter. Shame they had to kill off Quill, Spiderman etc because they already announced another Guardians and Spiderman movie. If Marvel wants their movies to have conequences or intrigue they should stop announcing sequels before other movies those characters appear in. Really, really stupid. And the way Loki died was also unearned. Still, probably the best Marvel movie for me.", "AMAZING! Grear characters with great story! Was never bored when I watched this opening day!", "Strengths \n-Every comic book reader's wet dream \n-Visually the movie is nice\n-Entertaining action sequences \n-Follows multiple characters along different paths so you don't get bored fast  Weaknesses \n-Like every other superhero movie, it caters to the younger audiences, which isn't a bad thing, but adults may find it too silly\n-Story is too simple\n-Too many jokes & comic relief characters \n-\"Shocking\" ending", "Ok, so Stark, Strange, and Spiderman are aboard the ship after sending Thanos' henchman out into space-Alien/Aliens style. Then Dr.Strange comments that there's no way to turn the ship around to get back to earth. Did he forget he can wave a circular motion in the air and make a bridge back to earth or anywhere else in the universe? Iron Man could've set charges aboard the space ship- nuking it 1 min after they portaled back to earth and vaporized the entire ship and any data on board of where it's been? Thanos has no clue where the other stones are and Peter & Tony are back on Earth to give near full might, minus Thor, back to the Avengers squad. How about Dr. Strange creating a portal above Thanos head, glove arm, or cheat, and the other sending portsl into any sun other than ours in the universe? Cover blatant plotholes screenwriters...although this movie is geared towards the nondiscerning teen audience. So there's that..... or Strange could go back in time right after Loki was defeated on Earth and told Stark/Avengers. Heck, he could've went back before the attack and stopped Loki before he set into motion the invasion and told the others. He could've went back to after Thor came to earth and told him of all the events...and to tell Oden about Hella, etc & to stop Thanos before he attacked Gamora's world & ended it before it began. In addition, Gamora knows the stakes but folds and tells Thanos Voimir( spelling?) as to the Soul Stone's location. Caving under any circumstances is inexcusable but here is atrocious. No reasonable character would do that. I'd tell Thanos some other planet and lead him on a series of goose chases until I (Gamora) could kill myself- since he has no time stone. Cut your tongue out and fingers off. Stab your eyes out, then jam a sharp knife like object into your ear. This is why scifi sucks for adults...particularly new Star Wars movies are really stupid. Like it takes a genius to concieve using anything at the speed of light to destroy things. You could've shot an escape pod at the speed of lifht st the Death Star and the Death Star would've been vaporized by the heat. Eitherhave a universe where characters can conceive of these things from first sec of movie 1 or have them never think of it. How about how Last Jedi has bombs drop in space fall down towards the enemy ship....it's space. Things don't fall down from free will. Also, to demonstrate the Russo Bros are not the Coen Bros, how is it that when Gamora is a child the kinfe/blade is huge in her hands, yet as an adult, when Gamora attacks Thanos with it and stabs the false illusion Thanos, the knife is like a staff.. again the sizes should've been reversed. It should've been a staff sized object when child and switch blade like knife as an adult. Poor, poor storytelling directors. How does that get out of the CGI room without someone spotting this error too. Pretend you're making the movie for adults and kids and teens will like it and the adults they become will be able to like it too. Give me a camera crew & a script and I'll make a name for myself nowadays, like Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs. Classics just gave a damn back in the day.", "Only registered to point this out because it's got beyond a joke. The reviews can't be trusted.. Before \"Black Panther\" hit theaters, alt-right Facebook group \"Down With Disney's Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys\" announced plans to sabotage the \"Black Panther\" audience score (the same group previously took responsibility for targeting \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" with negative scores). The group reportedly created a Facebook event called \"Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes\". \nSeriously. What a joke the reviews have become and a waste of anyone's time to read. I think IMDb has a problem with its own \"User Score,\" which allows registered users to rate a film on its scale of 1 to 10 stars only after the film has been released or screened at least once.

I am a bit of a hard-core marvel fan myself and didnt consider this film as great as people claim. Yes loads and i mean LOADS of stuff could've been better but the movie still came out just as i expected it will. Not that much dialogue, thanos underrated powers, that he will win and many characters were gonna die. I think this is the first movie in this industry to make an attempt at doing something this big, i think they did an \"OK\" job that will get improved later on. The movie received lots of unnecessary hype from lots of marvel fans that claim its the best comic book movie ever made, only because they got to see some of their favourite characters onscreen together. Some people claim its really bad because of whats wrong in it which i think they did their best as whay was expected was delivered. Others claim they didnt enjoy thw movie because they didnt get what was going on, that movie is simply not for you, watch the previous ones, read comics do anything just dont go and watch a movie that you have to build yourself up to without doing so and blame that on the movie", "Best Movie Ever I'm Waiting For The Next Film And I'm Certain That It Will Better Than This Film Although This Film Is Excellent", "Avengers Infinity War is one of those rare gems where a movie exceeds your expectations. The action sequences and tge production design is phenomenal no surprise in that as its an MCU movie. Thanos is a fantastic villain, I despised his actions in the movie but there was something about the way his character was written that makes the audience know why his motives and they've shown him not necessarily a conflicted character but a character that has a certain level of humanity props to Josh Brolin for making Thanos believable and not some generic bad guy. This film really shocked me with some of the decisions and some of the character arks and I'm glad that it didn't go the safe route. Honestly I believe that this may very well be one of the best MCU movies and one of the best to come out this year. My only problem with the film is that the film didn't flow fluently which I get because there were so many subplots but that's the only issue I have. Lastly, the Russo brothers deserve the respect of every movie fan for putting together such an epic and grand movie and making it good.", "This movie enforce me to watch again at least 8 marvels movies to understand thi one.....

They are all doing what they are good at doing with their skill sets used for protecting the Universe. There are the fights, then the battle. Then they lose. They lose big. What? Yep. Why? Logically, how can they not? Logically, And that is the beauty of what is presented here. A bold move for beloved characters but it works. These Super Hero characters are faced to confront the inevitable. How can they combat an egotistical maniac with power who thinks he knows what is good for the Universe as he sees it --and knows if he can capture the five stones that (basically) represent a corner of each existence to do so? Nothing will stop him. He will destroy family, friends, Nations, Worlds to get what he wants. And gets it. That..is Thanos. (What..? Who'd you think I was referring to? If so, then maybe that's why the film irritates some, and saddens others. It takes you from fiction to a possible reality and that makes you..think). No plot? Really, it's the oldest plot in the world and presented here it is entertaining, but heartbreaking. Heroes win, don't they? Evil gets defeated, doesn't it within 2 1/2 hours with all your favorite Marvel Superheros at battle? This film starts with horror, and ends with it too. That is the beauty of this entry. Fans will walk away musing as things are left open (not unsolved). Fans also know that Thanos will not magically disappear and everything will turn out perfect. It didn't. It won't. Thanos is the part of the Marvel Universe you'd never expect to see in an entertainment film, but had to. And now is a good a time as any to do so. Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Vision, Guardians of the Galaxy and all the characters that surround them are all here to battle to save the Universe. Universe. Big place. It was great to see them all on the screen, and as I've already mentioned, doing what they do best. The BEST part of it for me is seeing them act as teams to do so. But, they are battling a more than formidable entity no matter how much teamwork they try to overcome it. Hope? Well, that I won't spoil for you -- but let me tell ya, the Marvel Universe is HUGE, and this film only touches the surface of what else can be introduced. And one part of the MCU I've been waiting for, is strongly hinted to arrive, and I cannot be more happier to see it (in the next installment, I'd bet big, yes!). Will there be a happier ending there, maybe? Um, not sure. But that what makes this a great film -more than just a summer blockbuster, more than just a bunch of Super Heroes in the screen mulling around the Universe.

Thanos finally reaching our heroes and putting their strengths and weaknesses to the test. That's exactly what the Russo brothers did and what the cast gave us. Josh Brolin as Thanos is just the right amount of villain to make you hate his guts but right when you think he's finally shown some sympathy to our heroes he stabs us all in the back (or pushes us off a cliff) to make us realize that hummanity has created the best and worst of us. And that's all portrayed in Thanos. \nThe core 6 (minus Hawkeye) so 5, are all there with all the new additions and they are are surprisingly entertaining, heartwarming, devestatingly sad, and everything we asked for, even in Star Lord who I never could fully connect with. (Kudos to Chris Pratt for showing he's truly got a soul and isn't a totally butthole).  Two complaints: not enough Wakanda! Not only was Black Panther a wonderful edition to the MCU, it had more likability than GOTG (1&2) and better characters and we were snubbed of that. Especially T'Challa and Steve.  Second: not enough build up to the return of Red Skull. Perhaps it was meant to be a surprise and it did surprise me that they went that route but for fans who didn't see Cap 1 or never truly followed along to the MCU, it left them confused as to who that was and why I was wide eyed at the scene. We could have gotten some kind of clue that he would return and how he might affect the future films and if he will ever interact with Cap again before Evans' contract ends.  Overall: one of the best Avengers films there is. Marvel Cinematic Universe films that is. Perhaps it doesn't top Black Panther for the year and Ant-Man 2 is certainly in third, but it holds its own and will forever be the movie that had us shaken to our core when the screen went black at the end.", "The CGI was way too much when compared to the other Avengers titles, maybe its due to Thanos's big head, but one thing is for certain, they should've toned down the CGI on this one a bit. I really loved the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, and one of the reasons was the comedy and the music, but over here the jokes were not funny. It looked like they were trying too much. The characters a bit boring, it would've been better if they were not part of this movie. The movie was all over the place, with characters moving in and out of locations, Killing off characters, even the characters with super powers were using Iron Man suits.

Can't wait for part 2.", "As I do all the Marvel films constantly look out for Stan Lee and he arrives pretty quickly in this one.Had to admit had a little chuckle at my over enthusiasm at looking out for Mr lee.But there you go my review of this film is from my initial will it won't it be good or great after my last foray into the marvel universe left me feeling a little less than thrilled with Avengers Age Of Ultron and it being one that I wanted to finish as needed to see it through to the end in a desperate desire that it may get better toward the end but unfortunently it didn't. Infinity War however was absolutely the opposite holding my curiosity from start to finish. Incorporating a entire cornucopia of Marvel characters and holding you on the edge of your seat until the end. If as I started I was metamorphasised into the aforementioned mentioned Mr Lee I would be more than happy with this showpiece of the fantastic realm that is Marvel.", "Infinity war is more of a event then a movie because you can't make a three act structure with that many characters it's just them fighting but the movie still works because i know all them from the previous mcu movies, the visual effects look really good especially thanos he will hold up for a while but the cgi on the humans looked little bad, the only character who has any character development is thanos if anything he's the protagonist, you get his motivation you don't agree with him but you understand it what his trying to do, there are some subtle lines that remind you about some of that characters backstory but there are some bad lines in the movie, i was little disappointed because one of the main characters didn't have a lot screen time especially concerning how big of a character he is, there too many jokes in this movie even in the emotional moments which is kind annoying, overall if your a fan of the mcu you'll like it if your not then you not going to like.", "I have to admit, before seeing this movie, I didn't take time to re-watch all of the previous MCU films. I still enjoyed Infinity War very much! The action scenes are breath-taking, the character development is fantastic, and the ending is emotional-it broke my heart. After seeing Infinity War, I re-watched all 20+ MCU movies in the following days, and you know what, I was really amazed by how this story was prepared since day 1, and carried out so well. All movies and post-credit scenes combined made so much sense for the plot of Infinity War. \nThe best character, which I wasn't expecting, was Thanos. He was not some villain who just want to control or destroy the world. Thanos character was built with deep emotion, and a real good reason for his action.\nI am not good with words, so I cannot express how much I enjoy this film. I really recommend anyone who is going to watch this, re-watch the 20+ MCU movies first. Check on Youtube for how to watch MCU movies in the correct timeline order, don't watch them based on their year of release.", "Tell all from point of view of villain changed everything..multiple emotions", "A very successful blockbuster, which I can say is the one I enjoy the most in all the movies I have watched this year in cinema. I appreciate the visual pleasure it distributes through the abundant scenes with special effects as a typical Marvel movie, for which I suggest audiences to watch it in cinema for the best enjoyment. Also I'm really impressed by how they managed to put all the Marvel characters into this one movie without any pointless or boring plots.  However, it is inevitable that some dialogues and plots to introduce the other characters from a different story to connect to the original ones of Avengers series can make the narrative less compact and focused, but it is not a big influence overall. Moreover, to make up the distraction or confusion due to the added characters, I think they make good use of some of them like Grout from Guardians of the Galaxy. This is a movie Marvel fan shouldn't miss for sure.", "Infinity War entertains better than perhaps any other Marvel movie has to date. The action was fantastic, there were a few jokes in there,CGI is great and Marvel definitely has now solved their villain problem.\nIt portrayed all of the MCU characters very well and gave all of them major rolls in the story while not overpowering any one of them. This movie took major risks and I believe that Marvel executed it to perfection.", "A movie that will leave you so profoundly impacted that you will want to watch it again.", "I really loved this film and all the technical and cinematic elements, and it ripped my feelings into shreds too.", "After having watched this movie thrice - a rare feat that I've never done in recent years - I felt compelled to add this review, especially after I was equally compelled to review Black Panther for the huge disappointment that it was. To compare both movies would be an atrocity, so I wont even start. Infinity War just proved how important a Directors role is, in piecing a complex storyline into one coherent masterstroke of movie making - any lesser Director would have failed miserably. The sheer scope of the script, compounded by the greatest ensemble of characters ever assembled made it a herculan task , which was effortlessly handled by the Russo Brothers. The most important thing working for it was the humor, which flows through the storyline effortlessly, and never forced. Reminded me of how hard I was laughing through \"Thor : Ragnarok\" and how much I liked it for it quirky humor. If you happen to be one of those few who havent watched it yet - please do now!", "I was really exited for this movie and after watch I am just amazed the charcters are amazing josh brolin as thanos is incredible and the action is so good a must watch film", "I am so happy with this film. I don't ever write reviews for any movie, so this is my very first.  I have watched all of the Marvel films and most of them in theater. But I have never been more excited for a movie in my life! This wasn't just any movie. This was a damn event!! 10 years of Marvel. The character development they have for all of these films has been remarkable. Something I wish DC would do. It's so important to set a foundation with the characters so you can really care for them. I have seen this movie 3 times in theaters. I do not regret it. I needed to see it more than once at least, to get everything I possibly could out of it. It was so heartbreaking. The visual effects for the most part were spot on. And action was top notch and the acting was spectacular. Doctor Strange really stood out and proved to me that he's one hell of a Hero! Can't wait to see what's in store for Part two. Although I'm guessing there will be just as much or more heartbreak. Well done Marvel!", "When you watch the climatic film of a company who's produced superhero films for a decade, you wouldn't expect to see anything you hadn't seen in one shape or form of another. But this film defies all looming expectations and does an impeccable job of pulling you into it's rich overlapping plot and to-die-for characters in a epic part one finale of the first generation of the MCU. It's distinct bold flavor breeds massive success, and the whole world is thirsting for just one more film. And that's what they'll get. And somehow, it will be even more outstanding and extraordinary than the last.", "A full review will be added later on. All that I will say is that this film blew me away. A true mastepiece - having 3/4 of 100 charachters and still pulling it off as one of the highest rated films of all time!", "I'd been looking forward for the Infinity War before I went to see it. Sadly, it was on a fortnight later than other countries in China. So I went to see it in the first run. All the trailers and interview by the cast and director indicated the new Avengers movie would be a blockbuster, as well as heartbreaking. I was spoiled that Loki will die very soon in the beginning of the movie and I was very very sad . \nI watched the movie 5 times in all. The first time, I watched the movie with my friend and I was totally shocked by the begining scene. The dark light, horrible voice, blood and fire, broken tesseract, defeated Thor ,all showed Thanos's enormous capability. I'm big fan of Thor and Loki, I just can't believe one of my beloved characters died painfully within 10 minuets and Thor was exploded into the space, unknowing what will happen to him.\nInfinity war is grand. We can see almost all the superheroes from the former 18 movies, which is incredible. Thanos is absolutely the toughest vallain ever and his goal is to wipe out half of the universe randomly. I don't judge his purpose is right or wrong, but I don't like him. What broke my heart most is that heroes faught and they still lost. Everyone lost too much, including Thanos. The avengers are real avengers in the end.", "I just want to say what the Russo brothers have done is outstanding. Taking a film with such a crowded cast and as a result; a very crowded story. However, I don't consider that a flaw, but nevertheless a roadblock surely. I believe they have made the best movie that they or anyone else could have done. The film felt equally leveled out, giving each character is given their own individual moments to shine. Everyone brings it in the performances, not a single weak link among them. And for once Marvel seems to finally be nailing their villains. They showed it in Black Panther, and they show it here as well. But who's better Killmonger or Thanos? It all comes down to personal preference, but personally it's hard to say in that they are two completely different characters, they both strive for separate goals due to separate motivations. Killmonger's story felt sort of Shakespearean, while Thanos felt more traditional but still very compelling in its execution. Ultimately this film lets the villain be the star, but like I said before it gives the other characters moments to shine. The action is as good as any Marvel film up to this point, along with fluctuating emotions throughout. Overall, everything that Marvel has done seems to have come to fruition and really paid off. This film may leave you wondrous and speechless. For the 3 people who haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for?", "Like other reviews, I was very impressed by the villain character depth given to Thanos. I loved the Marvel Giant Cast. Still like the original Avengers personality interplay. Then I really liked the new character interplay ( Guardians). This isn't going to overshadow Shakespeare or any other classic artistic expression. But it is pure fun, just bad guys vs. good guys, no more no less......", "This is my first review at imdb and I have only one thing to say, this film is 'masterpiece'. It is beautifully shot and every moment of the film is worth remembering. It is more than just a superhero movie,it is a celebration of the wonderful ten years of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Each character shines throughout the entire Film. There were moments where I laughed and cheered, there were moments where I was deeply tensed for the characters and most important of all some unexpected moments that made me cry. My mother who is not much of a fan of superhero films enjoyed every moment of every scene. There was one particular scene almost at the end that really broke my heart and quite possibly one of the saddest scene in the entire film. Thanos is by far one of the best villains MCU ever had, he is scary, you cannot help but love and hate him at the same time. Avengers Infinity War is truly a spectacular superhero movie. The cast and crew members should be proud of themselves for the amount of effort they put into making this epic masterpiece. Cannot wait for Avengers 4!!!!!", "Bless their hearts they tried. Everything you expect in a superhero movie: Big Bad Villian\nSuperheroes Galore\nBig CGI Battles Then the other shoe drops... Just about everyone dies. Was that really necessary? Especially when they are going to bring most of them back eventually... I think not. I for one like my Avengers working together and getting along. All the hogwash about them not speaking to one another is bull. Marvel needs to get it together for the next one! On the whole entertaining...just a little disappointing...for what could have been.", "While \"Infinity War\" is beyond impressive as a cinematic experience & the culmination of at least 6 years of planning it fails to stand alone as a movie.\nFor fans of the MCU ,I belive this film is as close to perfect as marvel can get but (and there is a big but) if you have not watced the relatively recent marvel movies (\"Thor: Ragnarok\", \"Captain America: Civil War\" etc.) the new Avengers movie is going to be an epic mess. The fights are incredible, the emotions are intense & the villan is great for once but juggling that many characters is not simple in the lest. Some characters get epic arcs (Thor & Iron Man), other are dissapointing (Vision & Black Panther) & some are missing (Hawkeye & Ant Man). At the end of the day \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic adventure for marvel fans, it is a good movie & impressive in scope but if it were to be asked to stand alone it would crumble.", "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" does what no movie has done before: incorporate 40+ superhero characters into one epic showdown against a god-like villain. This idea may have seemed too daunting 10 years ago, but with the talent present and the previous success of the MCU to at least make a decent movie, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" delivers, and stands as one of the best MCU movies to date. The Russo Brothers prove to be the best directing force the MCU has to offer. They made Captain America good with \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and brought the franchise to its high point with \"Captain America: Civil War.\" They don't disappoint here and do a great job of integrating all three phases of the MCU. They deftly balance screen time allowing a lot of the characters time to shine. Though they definitely could've trimmed time with the more boring characters like Vision, Scarlett Witch, Gamora and Nebula. The Russo Brothers forte is with the character interplay. The superhero interactions are the highlight of the movie as their banter is very comical, eliciting nerdgasms galore. The Guardians are the funniest and arguable the best characters in the MCU. The cartoonish action takes a back seat to the abundant humor and witty interplay. The action scenes are mostly enjoyable and inventive especially with Doctor Strange's wizard portals. It's very exciting to see the Avengers use pop-culture references to solve their problems (i.e. Aliens). The problem is that there is still some cheesiness with the action (characters having small talk during huge fights, characters smashing into each other mindlessly). The aesthetic of the characters' costumes and the CGI battle scenes give off a cartoonish vibe. One would have to let their inner nerd carry them away for maximum enjoyment of the action. *Spoilers*\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" finally introduces the storyline of Thanos as a power player. Thanos isn't your typical I-want-to-rule-the-world bad guy. He presents himself as a reluctant father-figure willing to make the tough choice: to kill half of existence so the other half can live with their dwindling resources. Thanos does not see himself as a bad guy but as a liberator willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. Of course the Avengers don't see it that way. What results from the Avengers' and Thanos' showdown is something Marvel has not done before, nor anyone would think they had the balls to do.  Many of the common complaints regarding MCU is that the heroes are impenetrable and no matter how cool they make the action sequences look, there is still that lingering stigma that no one will die. This leaves the action to be without real stakes or compelling drama. But \"Infinity War\" changes it up here and has Thanos succeed in killing half the Avengers team off (a microcosm for humanity). This resulted in a shocking and totally unexpected move. But.... one problem. Some of the character deaths are probably gonna be permanent like Loki and Vision but people who died from vanishing are likely to come back in the next film after the Avengers figure out how to undo everything Thanos did. Even if certain characters stay dead, it's not like a whole lot of them will be missed (only Drax and the Guardians would be missed if they died). MCU has more films planned like another Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Strange sequels (all of said characters died in \"Infinity War\"). This all means MCU doesn't have the balls to kill off characters that will churn out more money. They may have fooled us for a little while but we know their tricks. Hopefully they prove me wrong in Part II. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the best Avengers movie and one of the best MCU movies to date. It's thoroughly watchable, funny, entertaining, and even has a few tricks up its sleeve. It's a movie too big to miss. To have this many iconic superheroes, big time stars, and outlandish cast of characters in one movie is a cinematic experience you cannot miss. Be sure to keep your expectations in check because this movie is still a Marvel movie at the end of the day. It is not as good as the IMDb rating of 8.7, which makes it a top 20 movie of all time. No way!", "Pros:\n - The hero coordinated fight scene on Titan.\n - Actors did a good job especially Thanos.\n - Somehow managed to give every hero some screen time. Cons:\n - So you are being escorted to the enemy's home planet and you haven't prepared for space. what do you do ? \n A. Return to Earth, come up with a solid plan and bait with the time stone.\n B. Go ahead with half the heroes to the enemy's home planet and come up with a plan with total strangers.  A. Reverse the hostage situation and leave Thanos in a time loop.\n B. Give up the time stone and make the enemy more powerful.  Hero flies in striking Thanos and on cue the same high note music plays in the background for every character.", "Marvel never fails at creating action-packed films. I was never bored throughout the movie. I am a sucker for good superhero action, so I found this very enjoyable. However, this is only nice if you don't over think it. Once you start analyzing the film and each individual character, things get confusing. \nYou can see for yourself, but as a fan of many Marvel superheroes, I was kind of disappointed at how some of them were portrayed (you'll see what I mean). I feel like Marvel made this film plot only regarding the end goal, hence they manipulated and portrayed many characters oddly (and incorrectly) just to reach that end goal. \nThis whole film felt like the set up for the sequel. The film had an overly simple plot and seemed set up just to give background for the upcoming sequel. \nMY RECOMMENDATION is to wait until the sequel is out, and then watch the two movies successively. I think that would be the most satisfying.\nNonetheless, I enjoyed the action. Viewing this film without overanalysing it would leave you pretty satisfied.", "I'll try to review this without spoilers\nThe story brings together \"other Marvel hero's\", and this does seem to work with a good solid story, at times it might feel that it does drag, but given the fact it is including a number of Marvel character's, I think it works very well.\nThe story has a lot of \"humour \" between the character's and that seems to keep the story going strong.\nYes there are some moments that are like (really?) but let's remember it's a super hero film and it has to be believable and a little far fetched, but to the \"younger generation it is believable throughout I'm sure\" I feel the film works well and I do hope that the franchise can keep going and keep it \"fresh and exciting\", let's not forget that as a Marvel film Iron Man 2/3 wasn't as good as the original, along with \"the Hulk\" has always flopped on its own but having a cross over with more Marvel characters could get boring, but I think this film is definitely a 7/10 Is this the end of the Marvel franchise, I hope not, But I hope they can keep the Director and script writer as it does work very well", "All throughout these ten years everything has been building up to this movie, and it surely does pay off big time. The action is incredible and the characters are so well used, it gets the plot moving constantly. Thanos is fantastic as the villain, and certainly the best MCU villain ever. Definitely one of the best superhero films ever made, and a total joy to be able to see it on the big screen.", "After 10 years of buildup Infinity War lived up to the hype and then some. Not a single character is wasted and Josh Brolin gives a memorable performance as Thanos.", "Anybody who is a fan of the comics of Infinity Gauntlet should not be disappointed at all in this film. This film is action-packed, full of surprises, and is full of the grit that can be found in this comic series. Should you feel as though this film is boring, I feel as though you need to reconstitute what you perceive to be fun and entertaining. This is one of the greatest films of all time for a reason. Enjoy your experience.", "It was bad so, you know yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah", "2 years ago, I watched Civil War and was positively wowed by it, much so that I became an undying fan of the MCU. The MCU is admirable for managing to build an almost 20-film franchise packed with great films all leading up to this movie. Story: The story (for those who don't already know) is about the Avengers teaming up once again to face their biggest threat: Thanos. The Mad Titan wishes to collect the Infinity Stones to bedazzle his Infinity Gauntlet and wipe out half of the universe. The story is extremely captivating with major surprises throughout the movie and one WHOPPER of an ending. Direction: My major worry about this movie was how they were going to keep track of several plotlines without it feeling convoluted. And miraculously, the Russos pull off such a juggling act almost perfectly. Some storylines do go on for longer than they should but overall, it never feels overwhelming. Script: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have made a fabulous script with plenty of comedy and yet great dramatic moments. However, some moments do feel too melodramatic and one moment in particular was undercut by a joke but that might the director/actor's fault.  Performances: I can't make this too long (there are over 20 HEROES in this, ok?) but everyone does well. However, Thanos is on another level compared to the rest. Josh Brolin manages to intimidate you as soon as he appears on screen. A serious achievement for Marvel to create such a villain worth the decade-long wait. Other Elements: As for the other parts, the action is well-done with less shaky cam than previous entries in the Russo's MCU movies. Everything else is fine though. Conclusion: To conclude, Infinity War truly lives up to the hype, being an entertaining, funny and emotional blockbuster that can delight MCU fans and regular moviegoers alike. In the words of Kevin Smith: It's going to be a long year until Avengers 4...", "The fact that this movie is getting better reviews than movies like Psycho, The silence of the lambs Star Wars V and City of God astonishes me.... It's an okay superhero movie that had way too much hype.  It's annoying how people can be blinded from plot holes, cheap character deaths and frankly some cheesy acting for the most part just because of the hype. I will say this tough, seeing my favorite superheroes unite is super fun, but let's not confuse FUN, with an overall GOOD movie", "This movie was a rollar coaster from start to finish. It was like the movie was split into three sections, each section like each team. So it was like you were going from one location to another and back again. The story was well written though the giant cliffhanger at the end was upsetting. Very much unlike marvel. Josh Brolin, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Hemsworth stole the show in my opinion. The chemistry between Thanos and Gamora was really good. RDJ was as always great and a lot of emotion all round the movie.", "So here it is, perhaps the most anticipated superhero movie ever + the 3rd Avengers movie to date. This time Thanos takes over villain duties + i have to be honest, during the 1st 10 mins of this movie i was unsure if he could cut it alongside Ultron, but i was proved wrong, he's as badass as they come. What i wasn't so unsure of in those few minutes is that some of the heroes might not make it, but to save from any spoilers, i won't say who or when.\n The plot for this movie is a simple one, but one that has been used for some great superhero movies and used here for best effect. It revolves around Thanos scouring the universe in an attempt to gather all the infinity stones and that means facing off with some of Marvel's greatest characters including Spiderman, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man and Black Panther.\n The Special Fx in this movie are stunning and the action scenes thrilling, particularly the last climactic battle.\n As for the heroes, Spiderman with his wit, Iron man + Dr Strange, who face off with verbal sparring and Thor, who is always worth watching, are the stand-outs and of course Groot is always a laugh. Surprisingly though, captain America and Black Panther who are so good in their own movies are a bit bland here and lost in the mass of characters this movie has.\n So on the whole there is a lot to enjoy here, but there is some down-sides, mainly in the movie's middle set, where the movie gets a little laggy + perhaps there's too many heroes, especially given that there is no point in the movie where all the characters share the screen at once.\n So is this the movie of the franchise, definitely not, for me, Thor; Dark World and Avengers Assemble have that accolade, and it's not the movie of the year so far either, that goes to Rampage, but it's still great popcorn fayer and has points where your jaw may drop so far it hits the ground....yes Marvel really did just do that.", "When we viewers have become slaves to a certain title or series, or a franchise with parts one to infinity- this is what we're bound to be served- A smorgasbord of headache on the storyline, camouflaged by fast pace CGI , that at one point you don't know anymore how A got to B and so on. There were definitely some moments worth the laugh especially on the part where Quill was trying to measure up to Thor and Rocket said ' you're just a sandwich away from being fat' . I guess Stan Lee at his age still wants to have his say as to what makes people love Marvel stuff. But the fanbase is not limited to geeks and nerds, there are also plain folks who can't fathom the hell out of the film, people sitting next to me yawning and or yelling ' GDI, there's just sooooo many things all at the same time . My own take is that when there's just too many superheroes in one story perhaps with the aim of letting the audience choose their fave one, this is what happens- majority of the audience leave the cinema more exhausted than the story itself. If the box office is the only thing that matters, then just go full throttle and put every comic character in the Marvel planet in all the sequels until the viewer surrenders from brainbleed.", "The movie was only half as good as they made me think it would be. They did a great job on the story, but they did leave a few plotholes. I was really suprised by Thanos' character. He wasn't just a big scary purple alien. He is actually very complex and cool. He felt more like a human being (alien being..) then some of the hero's.", "This is my all time marvels fav movie ever.were all characters were shown perfectly,the graphics was awesome and the thanos performance where very very very good.", "After reading through a lot of this movies user reviews, I found it necessary to give my ideas about it. Clearly, many disliked the ending because it was against the traditional 'happy ever after' ending, that, however, too many movies have. The end is a bit unclear which the next movie hopefully will address, but still this was the ending the movie should more or less have. Of course Marvel Studios could have produced a similar movie like the other Avenger movies, but why? We already know a lot about our superheroes. This movie was focused on Thanos (which is one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel Universe) and his obsession on balance. The scene when he invades Gamora's planet and talks about his small knife and about balance it, was breathtaking in many different aspects. This is a dark and sad movie, and it should be. Maybe not the best movie to see with your 11 yr old son/daughter. However, if the outcome of this first movie would have turned out differently, I would have been disappointed. No one in the Avengers team should stand a chance, even though Thor made a sweet entrance with his new axe. Also, the scene with Doctor Strange looking into the future will be key in the next sequel. Yeah sure, some characters died a bit too easily (especially Maw). But the movie was already long enough. However, it felt a bit fast forwarded so this movie could easily have been divided into two parts/movies, focusing more on the story than the fighting-sceens. Some interactions with our superheroes were quite satisfying. Thor, Rocket and Groot had several funny scenes, as well with Iron Man, Spiderman and Doctor Strange.  I had high expectations on this movie entering the cinema and I was not disappointed. For those of you that think that Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. have died, I bet the opposite. However, that remains to see.", "Its not about super heroes, Its about super Villain - THANOS.\nI must say that we should watch this movie as ORIGIN of super villain , the bad-ass , artifacts of unimaginable power, and master of all six infinity stones. all super heroes are just like child to him. how much all super heroes are powerful but they nothing against him. he finished half universe by justifying a balance should remain between everything. He is emotional but ruthless. Ready to scarifies everything he loves just to achieve his goal.", "Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger After 10 years of character and plot building, we finally get what we have been waiting for. Infinity War is a film of epic proportion that makes first Avengers film look like a small feat. Infinity War has a complex story filled with exquisite fight sequences, humor, and amazing characters. The biggest hurdle for this film was fitting in a lot of characters in only two and a half hours. Anthony and Joe Russo successfully give all the characters a fair amount of screen time and introduces use to the amazingly effective Thanos. The story is filled with emotional moments and has some power when it comes to the reality of Thanos' power. The acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Zoe Saldana, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, and many others perform very well. Josh Brolin performs the best in my eyes. He plays Thanos who is extremely complex and is the second-best superhero villain I have ever witnessed behind The Joker. Thanos truly is the best part of the film in my eyes.  The pacing is perfect. Infinity War throws us into the action immediately and doesn't let up. The runtime is also perfect. There are a couple of things a didn't like in the film. Peter Dinklage's character looked rather foolish. His accent and the way his character looked made him seem fake. I also didn't like the Wakanda scenes. Their accents are extremely annoying, in my eyes, and some the characters in Wakanda are kinda cringy.  All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is a masterclass superhero film. It is the second-best superhero film ever made right behind Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I truly loved it and I am really excited for part two. Pros: Intense, emotional, and heartbreaking story, good humor, amazing characters, very good acting, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Thanos being one of the greatest movie villains ever, great pacing, a good runtime, and how Thanos is a really effective villain throughout the entire film Cons: Peter Dinklage's character is and looks bad and most of the Wakanda scenes and characters are kinda cringy Overall Rating: 9.0", "It was a hell of a ride with this movie! So much emotion, so much joy, so much energy, so much empathy, so much fun, so much tears! And again so much fun! Characters were so real presented, and so relatable. I felt like I was part of them, they were honest, determinated and every scene was intense. Whole movie was understandable, while it presented every point of view of the characters. They were so relatable. I enjoyed every second of the movie! I couldn't believe that beginning would be so intense. Not to mention the end of the movie, which was just perfect...despite river of tears....I think this movie is a MASTERPIECE! The characters were so good presented. So as the villain. Just wow, as Loki. Understandable and amazing! Brolin was amazing and makes the villain shine! All I can say is, MARVEL is killing it! It was amazing and I am proud to be marvels fan! \nI am till the end of the line with them!!!", "Avengers Infinity War, the film Marvel fans have all been waiting for since the first Avengers film came out in 2012, has finally arrived and it is safe to say it has lived up to the hype from the last few years. The Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, have returned this time teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther and overall the largest ensemble of superhero characters the world has ever seen on film to defeat the deadly Thanos. The film is large in everything, scale, cast, visual effects, action, just about all one expects to see and as it progresses, it doesn't shy away from reminding audience viewers how large it is. The film's time length was necessary to establish it's story and it's characters correctly. That said not every one is a fan of films that pass 2 hours for issues concerning the story dragging on too much and too many characters to explore with not many receiving proper care. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best example of films that reach the 3 hour length of time that is necessary to explore all plot lines. That trilogy worked out for many audience viewers though many that try and replicate this formula rarely succeed to accomplish what Lord of the Rings did. Avengers Infinity War is 2 hours and 40 minutes long and for the most part it succeeded in what it set out to do while many may say differently, especially those who aren't the biggest fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney has never been more the extravagantly triumphant corporation that it is today with all the brands and licenses they have the rights too and because Infinity War has turned a grand profit, earning an estimated $640.9 million at the worldwide box office it's opening weekend, the latter proves itself true.  This film is mainly about Thanos. For a movie based on the heroes the Avengers, it's really his film as it explores his character in deep more than the others. Some have complained that Thanos should have been developed little by little in past MCU films before this one, however Thanos doesn't disappoint. This is probably the film's strongest point. He makes Ultron and Loki look like preschool for the Avengers to face. The best thing about Thanos is what a complex villain he is. He's more than a world conquering doomsday villain. His character is incredibly complex to the point where you can't decide whether or not you hate him or love him. The visuals for him as well as his acting portrayal are phenomenal, the same cannot be said for many villain characters portrayed through the use of CGI/motion capture. Possibly the most interesting villain character aside from Loki, he is also undoubtedly the most powerful adversary any of the Avengers have faced, proving too great of a challenge for all put together. The entire cast were amazing to see all together for the very first time, even though some got more time on screen than others do. Particular highlights include Robert Downey Jr. as he continues to develop Tony Stark's character in his darker side, having been tormented since the first Avengers film happened all leading up to him facing his greatest fear. Zoe Saldana excels portraying Gamora's suffering from Thanos that has left her damaged all her life, a side to her that has never been seen before. Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange brought a powerful, stoic presence among the film's cast. He shares great scenes with Robert Downey Jr. and they are shown to have great on screen chemistry. The rest of the characters served their purposes uniquely in the film as well. Some provide more humor than others and some get more screen time, others get less. A film with this many characters can prove to be difficult with giving each their due screen time.  The last thing to point out about Infinity War apart from the acting and visuals are the action sequences. Probably some of the best we've seen throughout the franchise. The entire film is leading to one big inevitable war that does not disappoint. Every action sequence in the film from start to finish serves as a teaser for the upcoming battle that will determine the Universe's fate. Excitement and terror are the feelings you get when you're watching the fights as you're wondering what will happen and who will die. It is true that there are tragedies throughout; that said, people in the past have complained about Marvel continuing the habit of convincing the audience that characters die only to bring them back to life. Despite the fact that many of these actors have contracts with Marvel, some for up to five to six years, it is a truly bad habit the MCU needs to halt immediately. Yes tragic deaths of beloved characters may be tragic but sometimes characters who die need to stay dead to produce emotion. Be that as it may, Part 2 of Infinity War is set to be released May 3rd of 2019. It may be a long while though Ant-Man and the Wasp is set to come out this summer, Venom is set for the Fall so we'll have plenty of distractions from the anticipation. To conclude Avengers Infinity War is a spectacle on film that fans of the franchise up to this point will not be disappointed, including non-fans who can also enjoy the film. It will leave you itching for more.", "This movie will leave you floored. Marvel means business now. This movie brings together all of your favourite superheroes and weaves them into a desperate and complex narrative which surprisingly doesn't feel strained. The Russo brothers have done it again, they made a film that brings together all of these icons yet still tells a complete, well-defined story. This film has great humour but is mainly a darker film. The situation is tense and there is a strong feeling of hopelessness. Thanos is a very strong, compelling, almost sympathetic yet ruthless villlain unlike any the Avengers have faced before. Bring your tissues people because this movie pulls no punches. The film takes all sorts of risks and there are moments that are truly heartbreaking. YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! Fantastic movie that surprised me after 18 Marvel movies of the same.", "The one sole thing that deserves a 10 on whole movie is the greatest villain of the all. The GOAT! Mister Thanos to rule them all! God, where do I begin on this masterpiece. It is almost all I would ever expect from a Marvel movie. A whole bunch of heroes, heroines and everything in between. That Armageddon thing just dived me so deep in the movie I couln't look away. The action, cooperation, quick thinking and innovation, Avengers have it all.  And then on the other side (can't really say on which side) you got Thanos is is like The Philosopher of the entire universe. The villain you just can't entirely hate if just listen to what he is speaking. And judge me to be a psycho but it just make so much sense. And when you realize that while he is winning everything he is also losing everything, you just sit there trying to justify his actions so that you don't look like a total ass for liking him.  The reason why I didn't gave movie 10 but 9 is because I saw some stupid decisions that could have been easily avoided, and Marvels greediness. They just wouldn't let go on any of their golden geese. Other then that it is all just flawless. Totally recommend to anyone.", "I saw most comments condemning this movie.\nSo dark! Are you sure, you're not from DC universe?", "Action-packed, great story, wonderful visual, and else", "Awesome movie with awesome lineup of superheroes, can't wait to see where Marvel go with it next", "What more can you expect from a marvel movie? For a marvel movie it has almost everything. The first half of the movie was the strongest. My only objections are 1. Im not sure that spiderman belonged there 2. The jokes could have been a little bit less 3. How is it possible that Thor with his axe achieved such a strong ''deadly'' strike against Thanos in the end? I mean Thor is not stronger than Thanos.", "I am supporting hashtag of #thanosdidnothingwrong. its confuse always me that avengers shouldnt have to fight with thanos because logically he is right and other side what about life that nature has taken too much time(almost billion years,from single cell to giants) to evolve and live.", "First of all, one request: dear users, for years IMDB has been a film platform facing the movies critically. This gave unsuccesful movies the oppurtunity to shine worldwide. Before rating the movie, please take some time to think about how good it really was done. 10/10 doesn't mean just good and 1/10 doesn't mean just bad. There's a difference between how good the movie was and how much you liked it. For example, Jumanji is one of my favourite movies, since I grew up watching it so often, but it still is a mediocre to good movie and nothing more.  It was very difficult to make this movie good. You have very different type of characters and they had to put unfitting atmospheres together. Then you have the biggest antagonist, who was very passive in the former movies. In the end the most tough challenge was giving all the characters the spotlight. And all I can say is that the writers and the Russo brothers faced these challenges pretty well.  Pro:  Infinity War reacted to every former MCU film. It's truly impressive how they made all the movies relevant for this composition. After all, it didn't even feel forced. At this point I would like to suggest to watch every MCU film before this one.  You really felt how much the actors and actresses enjoyed their role. There's not a single actor who disappointed. But the real show-stealer was Josh Brollin as Thanos. The character didn't even feel like a CGI model and a big part of this work was Brollin.  They really created a classic villain with Thanos. There was a good balance between cruelty and transparency,  One specific event of this film created so much potential for the next sequel. It lowers the challenges they had to face with here. \nContra:  The decision to not rely on a main character and give everyone equal spotlight lead to less character development, except for Thanos and Gamora. The plot only reacted to the past, but there wasn't much plot in this movie itself.  Some people say that this was a dark movie. What they mean is that it has some dark events, but there weren't any dark elements. No matter how much I like the marvel characters, I really couldn't feel for them. It's not because of bad pacing like in other movies with this problem. It's because the mood immediately changes to too much comedy. And yes, the humour was great. But it wasn't necessary and took out the time for the actual plot. There weren't useful extended dialogues. In Guardians of Galaxy the comedic elements had meaning for the plot, but here they barely defined the characters and had the only function of making people laugh.  The score for the Avengers was never outstanding. Unfortunately here it was even annoying. But also this is a result of too many mood changes.  In the end Avengers: Infinity War is a decent popcorn film. As a marvel fan you will like it, as a movie fan you might get excited for the next sequel. In the end the path of Thanos was the deciding factor, while 50% of the movie was wasted with too much comedy and fight scenes. \n6.5/10", "It is all i expected from the movie and much more. going into the theater i thought theirs no way the movie could live up to the hype of 10 years. but i was so wrong. the audience were in sync . everyone laughed at the same time, everyone screamed at the same time( awesome entry of thor at the battlefield, ironman's nonotech suit etc). it was so awesome.", "Beautiful and very unique event, from beginning to end. Definitely requires knowledge of the marvel universe to even have a grasp of what is going on.  The action is fantastic and completely break-taking at points. Josh Brolin does a fantastic job with Thanos, becoming one of the best parts of the entire film. Some of the shots involing him were phenomenal, being so interesting to look at. Everybody has a fantastic energy; they all give a great performance and bounce of each other.  Such a fun experience and definitely worth a watch for all fans!", "Warning: Major spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War below. When Avengers: Infinity War opened on April 27th, it exceeded even Disney's own lofty expectations, besting Star Wars: The Force Awakens for the biggest box office opening in history. Given that it's the film meant to bring together all previous 18 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Infinity War certainly had plenty of audience hype working in its favor. But it also had a secret weapon to help inspire interest: death. For years now, fans and critics have vocally assumed that when the movie's big bad, Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally came to battle The Avengers face to face, at least one beloved character would end up dead. Some felt it would almost certainly be Captain America (Chris Evans); the constant back-and-forth of contract negotiations made Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark another likely possibility. But as audiences discovered at the end of Infinity War, it wasn't just one character who died. It was half of the team, with Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) just a few of the headliner characters who crumbled to dust when Thanos snapped his Infinity Gauntlet-clad fingers. And that doesn't even count Loki (Tom Hiddleston - who dies meanlessly), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Heimdall (Idris Elba), and Vision (Paul Bettany), all of whom bit the dust well before the movie's climactic moment. Thanos slaughtering half the universe, and half the characters built up as stars over the course of the past 10 years, was arresting, shocking, and utterly heartbreaking. It was a stunning ending. There was just one problem: it was totally meaningless. In the moment, the emotional impact of seeing all of those characters vanish is undeniably powerful. This is a franchise where no topline hero has truly died or even abandoned the series. I've seen the film twice, and both times, the audience in my theater has had the same gasping, horrified visceral reaction. It's a cinematic moment, unlike anything we've seen in modern blockbuster filmmaking. But the best way to gauge viewers' reactions to the ending is watching how they respond to the credits, and what comes after. Marvel fans have gotten used to two extra moments at the end of the studio's films: a mid-credits scene and a post-credits teaser, Infinity War drops the mid-credits scene, and subs in a title card, which crumbles to dust in the same way the fallen Avengers did. Both times I've seen the film, the audience has groaned audibly at that title card, as if they were hoping for some light-hearted moment of reprieve to make everything a little better. (The lone post-credits scene does tease Captain Marvel as a possible savior, but it's hard to get too excited after watching Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury disintegrate.) But the reason savvy movie audiences know to stay for post-credits sequences in the first place is the exact same reason the ending of Infinity War feels so cheap upon further reflection. This is an interconnected cinematic universe, with one movie setting up the next in an escalating series of introductions, team-ups, setbacks, and triumphs. No MCU film operates in isolation. And most fans of the series have an intrinsic awareness at this point that Infinity War sets up both Ant-Man and The Wasp (coming July 2018) and Captain Marvel (set for March 2019), which will inevitably set up the still-untitled Avengers sequel, and so on and so forth. If Marvel had killed off Captain America or Iron Man, audiences might have believed there would be no walkbacks or resurrections. Their characters have been milked by the MCU in numerous films over a decade, and it would not be hard at all to accept that their time had finally come. Instead, Thanos' grand act of destruction wipes out the characters that represent the future of the franchise. It targets the characters that Marvel's corporate parent, Disney, would simply never let go - especially since some of them already have sequels lined up. So once audiences step outside the theater and begin thinking about Avengers: Infinity War, what initially felt like a devastating loss begins to feel like the cheapest of stunts. People are just far too aware of the way entertainment is produced, promoted, and consumed to not recognize that none of these horrible deaths are actually going to stick. And to be fair, there is a positive element to that. Beloved characters dying is a downer, and an audience that truly believes their newest favorite character may be gone for good is an audience that could be disincentivized to check out the next Avengers installment when it rolls around. Instead, millions of Black Panther and Spider-Man fans - all of whom know T'Challa and Peter Parker will be back - will head into next year's Avengers movie eager to find out how their favorite characters will survive Thanos' wrath. The plot also sets up a potentially powerful torch-passing moment. The old-school Avengers survived Infinity War, but what if they eventually sacrifice themselves for real, in order to let the new generation of MCU heroes carry on the bigger fight? But even that calculation on Marvel's part betrays a certain amount of audience meta-awareness, a level of strategic thinking about the way corporations and studios position their intellectual properties to maximize their value across movies, TV shows, books, games, theme parks, and every other vertical possible. It's recognizing movies as pure business, rather than pure storytelling. And that may be the saddest lesson of Infinity War. I recall seeing The Empire Strikes Back when I was young. At the time, there were just two Star Wars movies. Darth Vader being Luke's father caused all kinds of good-guy vs. bad-guy cognitive dissonance, even for a child. Seeing Han Solo stuck in a block of carbonite and shipped off to a gangster was emotionally devastating, but it seemed all too possible that his story was over. There was no ongoing production pipeline to feed or larger ecosystem that required these characters to exist in perpetuity. The movie's cliffhanger ending set up a sequel, but there were no guarantees about how any of the storylines would actually turn out. It was a simpler time, and not just because we were younger. It was simpler because individual movies were still their own primary driving force. For audiences, there was no certainty about what could or couldn't happen when a storyline decided to get dark. For the simple experience of cinematic storytelling, it was a purer experience. In the days since I first saw Infinity War, I've wondered how its ending would have played in that environment. I would have been outraged, to be sure - but that outrage would have led to an even more potent catharsis when some of these \"dead\" characters inevitably return to the land of the living. Instead, we got a facsimile of loss, a moment where audiences go through the motions, aghast that a movie had the guts to kill off a leading character, without having to deal with any messy emotional ramifications. In a way, it does seem like the most Marvel approach possible. These are comic book movies, where nobody can really die - even after we see them turn to ash.", "It's not a bad film but its ultimately disappointing due to the sheer amount of plot holes and lack of believably I've not seen in a marvel film before. Also there isn't enough character development as the film is practically non-stop action. I think one of the main downfalls of this film is mixture of the earth bound MCU and the space bound MCU. The guardians of the galaxy shtick works for them in the bounds of space whereas the relative seriousness of the earth bound marvel characters works for them partly because of their limited and sober earthly setting. Mixing these two just doesn't work in my opinion. This film lent too much on the former to its detriment. For example, comedy is regularly overused and occasionally seems out of place given the relative gravity of the situation. Non-stop comedy works well for the guardians and it worked well in Thor Ragnorak but it really is overused here. Don't get me wrong, the jokes mostly hit their mark, I laughed a lot. But this just takes away from the supposed seriousness of the threat they face.  One of the most irritating things in the film for me was Vision. He's one of my favourite characters but for some unexplained reason he seems extremely weak and powerless in this film. He's supposed to be one of the most powerful avengers but seems unable to put up much of a fight at any point. I don't recall him using his phasing or laser powers even once. Very disappointing.  Thanos has the most character development in the film. He's an emotionally complex and extremely powerful villain. But this is an avengers film not a Thanos film so it would have been nice to have seen more of the avengers interacting with each other and having little characters arc moments. They mostly come across quite shallowly as a result.  There are however problems with Thanos and the infinity stones in general. First, Thanos wants to kill half the universes population for quite a flimsy silly reason. Because there are too many people and he wants to balance this out? This doesn't seem like a very good justification. Why would the universe suddenly be better if there were less people? Why care about 'the universe' more than people? He feels justified because his own planet was overpopulated but how does he know that other planets have the same problem? And won't these planets just repopulate themselves in time? His plan doesn't seems like a very practical or permanent solution! Plus, if he has all the infinity stones which give him infinite power then why not think of a more compassionate or permanent solution!?  Thanos becomes way too powerful and so there is no fun watching avengers struggle to contain him, you already know he can only win as this is the first half of Infinity war and can only end badly for the Avengers to set up the next one.  Why does Thor waste so much time making a new hammer? It seems a bit pointless.  Do the avengers on Wakanda really need to open the force-field thus letting in the alien army in order to stop them circling around? This seemed like a massive tactical mistake. The force-field was one of the few things keeping them safe.  The ending of the film where so many heroes 'die' is cheap and empty. We all know that most of these characters will be coming back in the next film as so many of them already have their own sequels lined up.  Some of the cool things in this film:  Ebony Maw is genuinely creepy and his powers are really cool. The other children of Thanos weren't as fleshed out or their powers as interesting or effective but they were still malevolent antagonists. \n \nThe red skull appearance was a nice surprise. Totally unexpected. As usual I love how Ironman fights and its always interesting to see how he has updated his latest suit.  The interaction between Stark and Strange is fun as the two egos butt heads. It would have been nicer to have seen more of this. It's also fun to see Strange using his powers in inventive ways but again not enough of it.  All in all, its fun but its pretty shallow, unless you're a big Thanos fan. Hopefully the real payoff will be in the sequel and there will be more space for the characters to breath. Well, since most of them are temporarily dead there surely will be!", "Marvel and the directors have done a fantastic job at keeping the movie spoiler free, so I'm going to keep this review spoiler free too. :) A few things you should know going into the movie, if you are deciding if you want to take your child or whatever, is that this movie is not another Thor Ragnarok. This movie is super dark to Ragnarok's light-hearted, fun. Not that it isn't good, its just different. The second thing you should know is the movie will not end resolved. This is more like a part 1. But a tastefully done and much needed movie split, not like Harry Potter or Twilight or The Hobbit, where it just seems like a money grab. And as always stay after the credits for the Marvel patented end credit scene.  Hands down the best thing about this movie is the villain Thanos and the amount of character development the put into the script. It's almost unprecedented the amount of screen time afforded to the antagonist. The second best thing is all the characters in this movie! The scale of the Marvel character integration is is just awesome. We see the Guardians of the Galaxy cast meet Thor, we have Spider-Man, the Black Panther, Dr. Strange, Loki, the Winter Soldier, and the core Avengers team: Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, the Black Widow, Vision, the Scarlet Witch, and more! We really only miss Ant-Man and Hawkeye. :( This is a must see in theaters movie, before you accidentally read or overhear a spoiler. Best enjoyed with popcorn.", "Great film. On a par with Avengers Assemble for me. Great balance of action and humour. Can't wait for Avengers 4", "This is not your normal Marvel movie and for good reason. My one criticism is that they spent a large portion of the film developing Thanos' character, but the Avengers (and others) seemed to not change, develope, or learn in any significant way from beginning to end. Other than that small issue, it's a well written story and finally a superhero movie that makes me want to see the next one.", "Major spoilers ahead\n.\n.\n.\n.\nSeriously, I discuss everything about the film without a concern for spoilers.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nYes, I really enjoyed it. It was so well crafted and it was wonderful to see the directors working with characters that are already established and hence have resonance and weight behind them. This being shown in something as small as Bruce needing a hug from Tony, which caught him by surprise or Rocket telling Bucky that he wanted his arm on the battlefield. The film just didn't let up, from the high drama at the beginning with the people from Ragnarok having been all but annihilated, to Hulk being trounced which clearly caused him to have some anxiety issues later (certainly the first time that he's been bested in a film) and then the death of Loki. I began to get worried come Thor 2 that Loki was taking over the franchise but Ragnarok firmly put Thor back in the picture and made me like Loki more because I didn't feel he was always getting the advantage over Thor. And talking of Thor, it certainly felt like his film. His interactions with 'the rabbit' and Groot were great yet the makers built in enough peril that I thought he might be killed off when they were making the Storm Breaker (\"it's a bit much\"). He at last felt like a god where his power could be revelled in without it seeming like he was dominating everyone if you get what I mean. Make him too powerful and everyone else seems too weak. It really is remarkable how Marvel in the space of two films (Ragnarok and Infinity War) have managed to turn round Thor to someone that wasn't as liked to someone who just owns the franchise. Hell, he even manages to outshine Tony. His entrance into the Wakanda battlefield gave me such a high that thinking about it now almost causes me to well up as I feel the rush of excitement. I was quiet in the screening but inside I wanted to jump out of my seat and punch the air. And whilst everyone is rightly terrified of Thanos, here is Thor bellowing \"Bring me Thanos!\" - what a badass. I'm a big fan of Cap and hence felt a similar version of the above euphoria when Cap and the crew turned up to rescue Scarlet Witch and Vision. The use of the Avengers theme at that point was so well played. I would have liked more of Cap in the film but I did find a piece from the writers saying that whilst some characters (Cap & Black widow) got less screen time, they would get more so in the next one - which is encouraging. Saying that though I wasn't upset by this. I thought the exchanges between Strange and Stark were great, I was worried that the levity of the Guardians crew might lessen the drama but it didn't. It provided a welcome release but with the death of Gamora showed that they were more than willing to plunge those guys into turmoil. I also thought Thanos was well developed. He believed what he was doing was right. And to some extent you could see the method in his madness and hence relate and understand where he was coming from. He didn't simply want to take over the world and have loads of money. He had a goal, he had a clear vision which made him richer as a character and more fearsome for his single minded determination. So much else to say but I fear that I rambling incoherently now. I loved 'beard' talk between Cap and Thor on the battlefield and thought the end with half of the people disappearing played out so well. Thanos won, he kicked arse and this was the consequence and when Spiderman went, that really caused a lump. It reminded you how brave he is because deep down he isn't even an adult yet, just a kid. You can only imagine what an even greater burden Tony will feel having seen Peter die in his arms. I genuinely can't wait to see the film again and obviously can't wait for the next one in the series. This really is how you do big epics. The recent Star Wars films have really disappointed me for showing film-makers dismissing their core audience for platitudes and PC sound bites but this film truly did deliver. A herculean task bringing a wealth of loved characters together and the writers and directors did an astonishing job. Servicing everyone's requirements, injecting new humour, making you feel tense and real peril for characters rather than it descending into an over indulgent CGI snooze fest. An incredible piece of work and an amazing experience to behold. Way to go Marvel and way to go The Russo brothers.", "To start, yes i'm a comic fanboy so i do know all the history of these characters and of Thanos. Without going into comic history of Celestials, and forces in the universe like Infinity and Galactus,,,, It does skirt some things to not mention how Thanos loved Death,,, and that Death is an actual entity in the universe,,, and that a huge portion of what he does is for her..... (Death is portrayed as female in the comic...) Beyond this they should explain his motivation better and his end goal,,,, his relationship with his family,,, etc But all that aside the things I really didn't like in this,,,, is Spidermans suit being created by Tony Stark and all it's gadgetry,,, I hate that... And Tony's suit is now like a bugs bunny cartoon,,, where shields and weapons and alterations happen almost as if when Bugs Bunny reaches behind him and pulls out a GIANT HAMMER,,, three times his size,,, and whacks someone with it. I like plausibility,, and the armor all the way through Ironman 3 and civil war, worked within reason ability of how it could be plausible, things didn't just GROW,,, they were nested, they were possible...... Now,,, it is all CGI,,, and what i mean by that, is it doesn't look possible,,,,, it looks ridiculous the things that it does...... It jumped the shark,,,, and I feel like that about Spidermans suit too,,,,, I liked Peter having a plain old suit,,, and web shooters,,, and him developing his own spidey tracer...... the rest of this,,,,, is just silly \nOther than those two critiques ,,,, I think the movie did a good job.... telling a complex story with numerous characters,,, many of which are unknown.. I am interested in the Captain Marvel angle, and how they dismiss the Kree Warrior,,, MAR-VEL,,, and running with Carol Danvers,,,,, and how she saves all.... Very interesting..... What do you think,, about the Suits excessive and improbable CGI", "I was blown away with the cast and how they seem to connect really good, i loved every moment leading up to the end.

Every Marvel fan has been anticipating this monetuous masterpiece for years on end, since the golden spark of Iron Man 1 was ignited for the world. Every decision, every move made by Marvel in the previous films that many thought unexplained or irrelevant has proven to play a huge part in this film. Such moments can make your hairs stand on end with excitement! Corny? I think not. This is one of the few films in the world that deserves every ounce of praise it receives from all directions; the only criticism being... WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?!  This film definitely knows how to engulf you in the main antagonist's personality and backstory perfectly from the minute we are introduced to him. Right off the bat, Thanos' dominant and fearsome defeat of Hulk with just 1 of the Infinity Stones really blows you away and throughout the film it is as if you have known the 'nutsack-chinned' titan for the previous 10 years! His motives are channelled exceptionally and there is a sense of sympathy that can arise for the mad titan due to the careful projection of his character in the movie. Bravo Anthony and Joe Russo! And now for the main event. The Avengers!\nThe Avengers are amazing in this film, each of the 3 sub-teams work perfectly together and the interactions between the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers is priceless! Star-Lord's reaction to Dr Strange's question on Titan is gold! Furthermore the battle on Titan itself is so tense, not a moment is filled with boredm and when Iron Man fights Thanos one on one only to be met with a piercing blade through his wortorn nanoparticle armour, my heart froze.  In regards to the battle of Wakanda...too epic for words. Now for the highlight of most reviews, the final 'SNAP' from Thanos. This moment was so shocking and suspense-filled that i think even the most sturdy of people would shed a tear to the chilling deaths that occur; first Bucky which just makes your jaw drop; then Black Panther which shocks you beyond belief and finally Spider-Man...the death that made men cry. Overall i highly recommend this film to long-time fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Marvel Comics fans, however, a word of warning to those not caught up on previous installments to the franchise; CATCH UP FIRST! Otherwise you'll honestly be more confused than Thor when he met the Guardians!", "The movie was hyped up like crazy.

I really enjoyed it... Untill the end. I am yet to understand why they killed off big characters. Black Panther was a great success in the box office, yet they killed him off. Dr Strange could have had a great sequel but he died. I don't understand why Marvel would do this. This is what bring my rating down to a six.", "This movie is really amazing though!! I think that this movie can get an Oscar in 2019 for sure though on this movie on what it has though!!!", "Visually spectacular, wittingly funny & absolutely chair glueing from start to finish, as a family of 4 we all thoroughly enjoyed this, can't wait for part 2!!!!", "I went down the list to see who Rated this Move 1 Star.

Rip DCU.", "A very well made film that somehow manages to keep order within all the chaos. Given such a large cast, the Russo Brothers managed to make the film feel smoother than a ton other films in the MCU and delivers the thrills and the chills that are beyond any other in the MCU. The cliffhanger is shocking and leaves us asking for more. Well, here's to another year of waiting.", "Epic and dynamic story not only on the earth, but galaxy. Plot (2.0)... clear storyline. Easy to tell both sides of good and evil. Honorable mention is that this film spares enough time to explain the background of evil side; Thanos. So that I felt the difference between two sides is only values each has. I can kinda understand his motivation.  Acting (2.5)... in both serious and funny part, they all excellent  Visual (1.5)... too much CGI although it's essential for this film. I felt like I'm watching TV game lol  Sound (2.0)... nothing impressive. But in later part, when they lost, the music edged with desperation is epic.", "Infinity war was good but the hype surrounding it made for a slightly underwhelming experience for me. So many heroes and with so little screen time, it just lacked the charm we've been used to with the last few Marvel films. Solid 8 for me. Whereas Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther for me were definitely 9's. Very good acting and action scenes. It's by no means a bad film, it's very good but falls slightly short of Marvels own standards as of late.", "All I can say is... What the hell Marvel?? And, go watch this movie", "I thought the way this was written was clever as it didn't focus on all of them at the same time. It was one of those films where you had to remember what happened and really tested you about what bits you know. I cried in the cinema when Vision was forced to be killed by Wanda. Definitely traumatised and I wouldn't go to see it if you're sensitive but if so, hey ho!", "It's a little overrated. Luckily, I knew this going into it. Nerds fanboy over these movies way to hard. It totally is not the best movie the world has ever seen; Overly done CGI, some annoying dialogue, and some parts were fairly unrealistic (I.e. Dr. Strange could have used his powers way more. Cut his arm off? Do something? (They totally repressed their super powers so that thanos would win)).\nThat being said, it was a great movie; Great acting, good plot, awesome villain.", "After 10-years of story building and character development, this is what we get; a montage of most (if not all) of our favorite characters that needed no story build up to understand where they were taking us in the overall story. The only character needing any maintanence during the movie was Thanos himself and that's because the movie was about him. His arc was the final piece to the 10-year old puzzle and it fit perfectly. Action, comedy, thriller, suspense, with a hint of horror, heartbreak, and romance, this movie was everything I've been waiting for and I'm excited to finish the story next summer.", "This movie has everything what a movie should have. \nAction/emotional/epic/well connected story from other marvels/ funny/ thriller/ \nEvery sec of this movie is so beautifully craft with every single detail.\nAfter watching it, makes you wowwwww and cant wait to watch the finale part..", "This was beyond the movie I expected. The Russo brothers did a unbelievable job with the cast and story line. The best villain next to Vader was created because you felt for him. The most emotional ending for a marvel movie ever. \nBeyond excited for the next movie a year from now. Please keep all of us in suspense and questions \nThanks for making comic books come alive that have been in my closet for 30yrs.", "This movie shouldn't even be physically possible. 18 movies before it, having to make sure everyone acts accordingly, make sure everyone gets screen time, and that's even before we get into the story. The movie is a masterpiece made over 10 years. No character feels out of place or over-used. I will admit there is one character in particular that could've been used more, but because of how much was going on it makes sense why he wasn't. Characters act like they should, and their chemistry is amazing. The three separate groups all work masterfully together. This movie honest to god had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, which is hard to do with me, especially for two and a half hours. I almost cried numerous times and legit couldn't walk when I left the theater. I had to hold onto my girlfriend so I wouldn't faint. It was that good. And I haven't even gotten to Thanos, aka the best mcu villain. His motivation is so much better then the comics, and he makes every scene feel like it could be the end for a character. You never know what will happen. Overall, this is my favorite mcu movie, and definitely in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.", "While I absolutely loved Infinity War...and I do mean love, there are scenes in this movie that I have wanted to see my entire life and I was not disappointed. But with that being said I was expecting this to be the greatest movie in the MCU because it was the culmination of the 18 movies up to this point. (I still would put Civil War, Winter Soldier, Guardians, and the original Avengers ahead of it). While 9/10 was the score I give it I feel like 9.5/10 is more appropriate. There was one thing that bothered me in the latter half of movie. This is clearly was a part 1 of 2. That is where my only problem lies. This is what I Imagine will be a better version of what I think Deathly Hallows Part I was to the Harry Potter series... but to the MCU. Highly recommend it but also feels like the episode before the season finale in this big budget tv show known as the MCU", "But we knew that, right? So Infinity War is just like a good warm up for\nthe great finale. That means my rating is not quite relevant because i can't\nget rid of a feeling Infinity War is just a half of the movie.\nBut i must admit it's a damn good half. And now the long waiting starts.", "Avergers: Infinity War is a culmination of Marvel Superheroes from the MCU, and this is by far, my favourite. The Russo brothers did a fantastic job of holding the audience's attention till the end credits and manged to provide a cliffhanger there too. It HAS lived up to the hype.\nThe story, as most of you will know, is about the mightiest villain Thanos, who is invading planets from the existing universe in search of Infinity Stones, a set of extremely powerful gems which will help Thanos being all-powerful. It is up to the Avengers to protect them and if possible, take them from Thanos. The action sequences: Larger than life will be an understatement. Watching in 3D is the most amazing experience one can have. Every time, the action offers something new. Every Marvel superhero has their signature style, with hyped features and fight sequences. It is a joy to watch that onscreen. But, Infinity War is not just about actions, it has emotions, and comedy sprinkled in too. That's what makes it stand out from the rest. That being said, handling a movie with so many superheroes, which stretches for more than 2 hours, has not been divided proportionately. Iron Man and Dr.Strange get the lion's share, next is Thor and the Guardians. Hulk is a surprise and gem. Watch, you'll understand. Although, we hardly see Black Panther, Bucky Barnes, Falcon and Black Widow kick some villains, barring 1 scene. But, I'm still OK with it. The ending left me like, \"I've to wait till 2019 now??\"", "Love this movie and love how everything seems so real and natural. Producers and actors did an amazing job.", "So I just got out of cinema. That ending was huge disappointment. Unpredictable yes but disappointing. Even more disappointing- lack of Steve Rogers / Captain America fights. I mean , COME ON, He deserves more than this!!! Thor had the spotlight. I do understand he is god but I like Cap more and I think he deserved another killer fight choreography as in his own movies. This was about the team yes- but I simply like his character the most of all avengers. Thor scene gave me goosebumps I admit. Humor is amazing through all movie. Especially The Guardians. All in all, this movie was entertaining, much better than the first Avengers (which I didn't like) but it's still not perfect. Most characters still look over cartoonised , or simply look like a psp game. The Lord of the rings convinced me long time ago that a fantasy/sci fi movie it doesn't have to look animated. I am not saying it should be 'DC dark' but Marvel must grow up. It's time!! Teenagers will have the most fun of all while watching this, it fits their age in maturity.", "When the movie starts you get thrown in it like it's a roller coaster ride from which you missed the start! The fights and deaths are unexpected and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Yes, it's dark and not for the little ones. When going further down the story line you still feel stuck in this crazy ride which is out of control! Trying to make it go to the left or the right, sitting on the edge of your seat, but you can't avoid getting shaken up by all of the events that are following.  Dr Strange tells Tony he sees over 14mil combinations and only one victory. So it's assumed he knew that Peter Quill would freak out about the gruesome death of Gamora when they subdued Thanos. This could have been a turning point but the future was already set so it kept on going. It surprised me that it was so easy for Thanos to get all the 6 infinity stones, but this was just part 1 and you could feel it. Just like you know that when the characters fade away as dust you're thinking: whaaaat!? What's going on? Oh no, the snapped fingers! No, they can't be dead.. can they? In this case, Spider-Mans death was the worst! Ok, they're are not really dead, but how they get back in Avengers 4 remains a mystery for now. I assume the others white died earlier aren't coming back, but who knows? There's tons of theories which includes characters that weren't introduced in this movie to bring them back. Hela (did Thanos do it to get her love? No way!) somehow resurrects them, infinity stone of time (too easy), time travel bracelets of Pym industries (revealed in Ant-Man and the Wasp), Asgard's eternal flame or maybe Odin joins the game, etc..  In the very end it leaves you with a cliffhanger. Why is Thanos smiling? What's next? Where's the gauntlet? How do the avengers get back from fading away? Are they trapped in the soul stone? Who's gonna fight him and will bring him down? Captain Marvel? Iron Man (the 1 victory Dr Strange sees?)? Captain America or wilt it be all of the above?  When the ride finally stops (movie stops) it makes you feel like you want more! So much to think about with all those possibilities for the next Avengers 4 so you get all philosophical about it. Too bad we'll have to wait for another year, but maybe we'll see some bread crumbs in post credit scenes in the upcoming MCU movies!", "Good build from start to the end.Still leaving a plenty of questions where we all can find out in the upcoming Avengers movie.So everyone is excited to watch it as it is going to be the biggest movie in the series.\nEven the movie contains big actions the movie entertained all of us with the usual humorous scenes making the movie watchable without any hesitation for all kind of fans and that is one of the main reasons for the success of the entire movie universe(according to me).All in all this mark as one of the best movies I ever watched.Well flowed from beginning to the end.", "Great movie, nice ending. But tried so much story in very less time.", "This is a truly eye opener avenger movie that i ever seen. All other marvel movie NOT even close to it. 1 thing i would like to point out, IRON MAN Technology has gone up insanely. I am super shocked ! As for the bad guy Thanos, well it did bring me some sadness and of course his super power ! Hey, even our big guy green man CANNOT find thanos ! Well the only sad part is, some of the heroes are gone......SIGH..... Well not going to mention who are the heroes. Looking foward 2019 part 2. Well worth movie ticket money !!", "Entrances paired with soundtracks paired with visual paired with excellent villain paired with engaging characters in intense fights alongwith an easy to follow plot makes this easily one of my personal all time favourite movies of all time.", "That's what Infinity War is... since the first Iron Man 10 years have passed, and Marvel Studios built, piece by piece, this ambitious superhero TV series for the cinema is something few people would have thought could work. We can now say the project was successful, even though there's a price to be paid: no talented directors to bring their vision to the characters (Whedon left, Wright was not even able to complete his Ant Man and so on) in name of the long term project, the budget per project was someway limited (this kind of movies usually has a much bigger budget) and, finally, you have movies like this one that don't stand on their own since the assumption is you watched the previous movies and know the characters. Anyway, Infinity War is the first part of the climax of the project, and it delivers more that 2 hours and a half of entertainment. Humor is well balanced as well as the on screen time of all characters. You'll not be bored. It's focused on the villain, finally a menacing (and interesting) one (even though his solution to what he feels is a lack of balance in the Universe is way too much simplistic).\nYou'll see a big and emotional ending, even though us comic book readers know very well that superheroes can overcome even the most dire of the situations. We just have to wait the next Avengers movie. Sure, the directing is TV-like, the special effects are limited by the budget, the OST is not exactly exciting even though better than most of the previous movies, we seem to have lost some details from what we watched before (example, in Ragnarok Thor finally is God of Thunder, his power not linked to the hammer that is merely something to better channel it, here it seems he's back to being the God of the Hammer... but he's as powerful as he should be). I'd say there are more pros than cons, and you should absolutely not miss this one if you watched the Marvel Studios movies so far but, if you didn't, don't bother watching this one.", "Instantly comes to top 10 greatest movies of all time. I saw it and there's no doubt about it. Must watch for everyone.", "I've been a Marvel fan ever since the Avengers came out. I watched it on the first Saturday the Firday came out. And the movie was epic. Ever since then, I've watched all of them in the theaters. And the shows. Then this movie came out and I was pleased with the overall story and all the heroes together to fight the villain we'd all been waiting for. It's true this had a lot of movie to be considered a good \"summer film\", but this had some flaws in cgi and (maybe) audio i general. The cgi on Thanos was great, but sometimes the movement of characters in the movie was just stiff with a low range of movement. In the first Avengers, we had Hulk flying and flexible, here he is with stiff fighting against Thanos. There's many examples. The music has been overused plenty of times, and tracks from previous movies has been recycled. This can be both good and bad. Pro, it has an epic compilation of music. Con, the music has no creativity as it's just reused. Also another one audio. Two times in the theater, the audio of the characters talking sounded like it was from an 80s film. It sounded so scuffed and muffled. Then when I watched it at home, it was a little more clear. This was the first movie for me to have been bad in the theater, but good at home. So, this movie will get a 7. The real fanservice made this great for a marvel movie, but there was some issues scattered throughout the movie.", "An epic film in many ways. I guess you'll need to have seen most of the MCU films of the last 10 years to completely follow the plot/story, there's action all the way through.  Many surprises to shock you, scenes that nearly left me in tears and made me laugh out loud. A proper emotion puller. Will add that whilst I've never read a comic, I could predict what the next avengers film will have in store due to the ending and lack of characters (hinted at in previous post credit scenes) which were missing from this. But my anticipation is at \"cannot wait level\". The largest complement I can pay it, is that at nearly 3 hrs long, it still felt as though it was rushed and not quite as polished in flowing smoothly as say ragnarock, but I still felt It left me wanting more. Well done to everyone involved.", "Having many heroes to speak about at the same time is not an easy task, they did well, seriously! you don't get lost and the movie makers keep you on the track in a very fair way for each avengers.\nThey finally develop the character of the villain/bad guy which give the movie more sens.\nI saw it in IMAX 3D, the 3D does not give much to the movie as it ismore backward 3D effect than coming to you (not in front of the screen). On the other hand the larger picture of the IMAx is a must! A good humor will make you smile and even laugh during the movie, it's welcome and much appreciated. I love the new armor nanotech of ironman, i think it have reach its best apogee, as well as making sens (Tony Stark is a genius after all). Thor is definitely the strongest Avengers, Dr Strange did very well and its red cape also! Finally i saw the forge where the Thor's Mjolnir was made, i was not disappointed at all, that's a real stellar forge. I will miss Loki, I found this actor acting perfect as Loki, and Loki is... Loki, a unique character. Does this movie deserve all the hipe? Yes maybe, \nDoes this movie deserve a 10 why not, but at one point the Black Panther armor's CGI was kind of forgotten as around his neck you can clearly sea the cloth of his spandex and not only one time but many times so = -1 Surprisingly there where no military involved, at all, so if earth is attacked we have only the Avengers? At least try to send few missiles or airplanes, just to say that we exist = -1, \nOK i am getting picky here. Overall i recommend this movie, it's one of the best Avengers and i can't wait next year! And now the Big BIG Spoiler Below:\nStarlord is responsible if Thanos have destroyed half of the universe. \nIron Man, Spiderman, Dr Strange, and the residual team of the guardians of the galaxy managed to remove his gauntlet, but Starlord fVck-up with a lack of selfcontrol! Go to see it, you will have a good time, and as always, Thanks for reading", "I can best describe this film as the \"SW Empire Strikes Back\" of the Marvel Comic Universe. Tons and tons of battle scenes on multiple fronts. Large military clashes on Wakanda, the city of the Black Panther. Other cities on earth are not spared either as the fights happens all over the globe and beyond. Yep, we get Superhero and Supervillian fist fights, sword fights and special powers fights on other worlds across the universe simultaneously. Even epic space battles. So much goes on the screen at once, you really must watch this film more than once to absorb it all. I cannot see the audience, especially those who are not well versed in the MCU narratives to pick up everything in just one sitting. For die heart comic book fan this movie is a must see.  The downside to it, in my opinion, the jokes weren't as funny as those in Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool . But this film as so much going for it, I did not mind that much.  The movie ends in a disastrous cliffhanger which will have audiences biting their nails for the next installment to this MCU franchise. If you go out to see it, stick around for the end credits because another scene for those patient enough to stay in their seats will be rewarded.", "I absolutely loved this film....The way it starts is awesome. The action is incredible and almost unmatched by any other MCU film. The finale is a glory to behold as well. The cast does a great job...especially the \"new\" villain Thanos. He's the star here.

Each character is perfectly portrayed by the actors and has kept nicely to the comics.", "This movie is very good about the general epic story matching the several characters together so to get the confrontation of the two factions. The most intriguing aspect concerns with the plan Thanos want to realize whose psychology is the most prominent. Thanos is a strategic powerful character leaded by the aim he consider good for univers' population, that is to deliver death so to get the balance. The event begins after the Asgardian defeat from Thanos army and then the facts follows each others rapidly until the mysterious end towards whom the disappear of Nick Fury represents the epilogue. Now all in this movie seems good and addictive and it seems to evoke the Lord of Rings, it only seems evoke without realize the same greatness because of deadline: the run-time. When too much situations have to be narrated in 2 and a half hours the result is not so great as it would be possible to get. Here where the 10 stars are reduced to 9 stars restored by the whole plot which acts as fix. The directors are one of the best choice in the whole directing options and probably they deserve the real tribute which would make this movie great but their work would deserve better outcome, if they could have developed the movie taking benefit of much more time so to get the same result of The Lord of The Rings. I hope that a 4 hours release can be commercialized in the market.", "I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie. Thrilling from start to finish. Hats off marvel", "In the past, I've enjoyed marvel movies, but I've never been a huge diehard fan. I've gotten use to the formula and I went into this movie expecting more of the same. But I'm happy to say that wasn't what I got. Avengers Infinity War has to be one of the most intense, epic movies I've ever seen. With breathtaking visuals, awesome fight scenes, funny one liners, and possibly one of the best villains of all time, Avengers infinity war launches the series in a new, much darker direction than I ever saw coming. You will not be dissapointed.", "Because my index for great epic adventure is dictated by Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the Marvel heroic tales like Avengers: Infinity War supply my modern need to experience excellence but fall short of Homer's weighty themes and complex characters. However, with super-human visuals, contemporary heroic films do a credible job of taking the place of my imagination.  Not that that substitution is preferable to Homer's working my mind to create Cyclops and Sirens and assorted baddies as well as the original modern smart hero, Odysseus. The Avengers and their buddies must come together to fight the mighty Thanos (Josh Brolin), whose goal as he decimates half the universe's population is to possess all six infinity stones. Because Vision (Paul Bettany) has the last one, you have an idea what the ending choreography will look like.  Yes, there will be the usual explosions and guns, which still strike me as incredulously outdated even though super-hero films abound with the munitions. I see in Infinity fewer explosions and fistfights than I have previously witnessed, a source of my abiding criticism of this genre. The Russo brothers directors have judiciously larded the film with these tropes while leaving plenty of room for wisecracks, a joy for me. Nobody does them better than Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), with his better-than-thou intelligence and impeccably caustic wit: \"I swore off dairy, then Ben and Jerry's named a flavor after me.\"Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) has some good ones as well: \"Let's talk about this plan of yours. I think it's good, except it sucks. So let me do the plan, and that way, it might be really good.\" I like the witty repartee much more than the explosions. With as many major warriors as could be possible on one screen, Infinity rarely develops character as we should expect in any drama, Greek or otherwise. Yet, the writers and directors can then guarantee the action to be constant and no one fall asleep, except those hard-core comic-book fans that wait for the scene after the end credits.  The final conflict guarantees a financially-rich opening for part two, which will have to move some to match the record-breaking first weekend take for Infinity. Homer would be happy enough with the new epics but much happier that his adventurers are guaranteed infinity or at least immortality.", "I will try to be as vague and spoiler-less as possible. Let me start out by saying that this movie requires you to watch some of the previous Marvel movies to be fully enjoyed. Infinity War was a great cinema flick which I feel is VERY re-watchable considering the sheer number of characters/actors in it. Great beginning, middle and end. Very humorous and interesting to see the different characters interacting with each other. There are a few \"stereotypical\" moments which is to be expected but overall a great movie. Keep in mind that it is a part 1 movie, so before fully judging it I feel I need to see part 2 also. I might be tempted to watch this again in the cinema which would make it the first movie (at least which I can remember) that I have seen and paid for twice in the cinema.  If you are a Marvel Movie fan you probably already seen it, if you aren't I highly suggest you see some of the previous Marvel movies beforehand. All in all, great movie, but requires some knowledge of the universe to be fully enjoyable.", "It perfect the sound ,graphics everything the perfection", "Seriously even though I have never been so hyped about a movie, it still exceeded my expectations by far. Definitely THE must see 2018", "This is the pay off of the entire MCU and it lives up to the hype.

And as far as the movie being too long, I didnt feel that while watching it. I was surprised when I looked at the time after. I dont know that someone could watch this without being familiar with the backstory of several previous movies and enjoy it as much.", "SPOILER ALERT: (THERE IS SERIOUSLY NO WAY TO REVIEW THIS FILM WITHOUT SPOILING ONE MINUTE DETAIL OF THE STORY)\nAs of April 27th 2018 (the time in which this review has been written), Avengers: Infinity War is the 9th highest rated film on IMDb. If you watch Infinity war with these expectations, well you might want to be ready to be slightly disappointed. That is not me trying to be negative about the movie, in fact I actually got much enjoyment out of it, but this ridiculously high score is one that should be taken with a grain of salt. And I say this mostly because in a lot of ways, Infinity War does what lots of other previous Avengers movies have already done before. It obviously turns up the scale of the plot to be this soaring epic battle between all the heroes in this universe and the unstoppable Thanos, but really it suffers from a lot of tropes and plot holes that these Marvel movies tend to have. I would say a lot of the story based problems I have come from the 1st Act. I really feel like they could have done a little better of a job introducing Thanos at the very beginning. He does look pretty intimidating and do some things that certainly show his strength like defeat the Hulk and kill Loki, but they really should have showed to massacre of the Asgardians in more detail to really emphasize what he was all about and the scale of how brutal he could be. Also what was up with Loki just dropping the tesseract? I mean he could held a little better of a grip on it... Loki's death was actually a pretty impactful event though and set the stakes for the rest of the movies. It was a serviceable start, but certainly could've used more in my opinion. One other thing I really got sick of was how much exposition these characters had to spew out at the start. Bruce Banner somehow knows all the intentions and details of Thanos' plan after only encountering him for a short amount of time. The fact that all the Avengers were split up and working in groups this whole movie also added to the amount of times different characters had to say the same things again. After the 1st act comes to an end, I actually found myself really enjoying Josh Brolin's Thanos. I would say that he is one of the better MCU villains and has proper motivation and characterization. I really have no complaints with his character (besides the CGI work on him which I found to be iffy at times). Overall the visual effects were okay. I would say this movie tends to be weaker on the visual side. In terms of the CGI it can range from being pretty good to slightly outdated. One scene I particularly found to be weird was after Thanos gets the soul stone he is laying in this body of water and I was really taken aback by how much that scene looked like it was straight out of a video game cut scene. Looked totally fake and really not good at all. Cinematography was also very bland but I really was not expecting much in the first place considering MCU movies tend to not be shot in the most creative of ways. The score was bland as well, but again, I wasn't really expecting much. Scenes that are sad will have the same stock sad dramatic music and epic actions scenes will have some generic music too. I always think it would be nice to get at least one more recognizable theme in the movie rather than just the Avengers theme that they have been using from the first movie. In terms of characters and their interactions, I think that this is Infinity War's strong suit. And it makes sense; after all these characters have been developed over 18 other MCU movies. Spider-Man is easily the best character in my opinion. He is always the center of attention for me and has some great action scenes while also being able to play off of all the other Avengers he encounters very nicely. The Guardians of the Galaxy were also all pretty good, Dr. Strange was alright, and surprisingly Thor was actually pretty fun to see too. I feel like all the weaker characters came from Captain America's side and they didn't seem to be as engaging to me. Gamora's death did not really impact me as much as it was intended to. I think that she may have been one of the weaker character in Infinity War. Even though they tried to add some depth to her through her relationship with Thanos, I still found her death to be silly. The acting was pretty good all around except for a couple weird lines with Mark Ruffalo here and there and also Elizabeth Olsen suddenly deciding to drop Scarlet Witch's Russian accent. One of the best and worst things about this movie is its ending. There is a lot to talk about here so I will try to keep it brief. The ending was actually pretty surprising but also not at the same time. With having half the Avengers \"die\" at the end, it makes for a surprise at first but in retrospect has no longevity. With so many Avengers being gone and so many of them already having solo movies planned and way too much riding on their death, you know they will come back. Its pretty much a given at this point and is one of the biggest superhero tropes of all time. I did find Peter Parker collapsing in front of Tony Stark to be pretty emotionally involved. The final shot with Thanos at the end looking into the sunset with a sense of accomplishment is so bittersweet. It is kinda hard not to think that the whole plot could've been resolved if Doctor Strange would've just threw Star Lord into a portal somewhere else. Like seriously, he could see all the outcomes but the one where he doesn't punch Thanos in the face right before they are about to take the gauntlet off doesn't save the day? I smell BS. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is good. It's not mind blowing or as risk taking as you think it may be, but with an ending that is pretty unexpected, whole cast of characters that play off each other nicely and decent pacing, it it pretty hard to say anything that is inherently bad about it. It achieves everything it wants to just fine and if you can get past some of the convenient plot devices and tropes that befall most Marvel movies, you will for sure have a fun time watching it and not be disappointed. Just keep your expectations low. This is not a 9/10 movie. Seriously.", "Folks, this movie is worth it. The plot is sound. Yes, from start to end it is action packed. However, there is emotional depth to the characters as well. And not to forget the well timed comedy. Go watch it. Remember, this is the culmination of 10 years work and setup. It manages to hit a satisfying note. And of course please note that if you want to fully appreciate and understand this movie and the events leading up to it, you will have to watch the previous Marvel movies. Otherwise, it'll just be empty and leave you confused. Cheers!", "Although a very good watch it feels a little pointless. Almost like absolutely everything that happened will be largely irrelevant once the second part of this comes out and everything gets undone via some turning back time shenanigans.  If everyone that died stays dead in the second part, I'll change this to a 10/10 as at that point it will have been epic and Thanos really would have been the big bad guy that they make him out to be.  Don't be fooled by the trailer in thinking that there will be an epic Cap vs Thanos fight. This was the biggest disappointment of the film.  Doesn't deserve the hype that it's got so far. That's not to say it's a bad film, because it isn't. It's just that as you already know it's two parts, it can't conceivably work with the way it has been left without some really sketchy undoing in the next part.", "All I can say is Wow, Wow, WOW!!!! I had to miss something b/c I will be going again on Tuesday!!!! Literally will keep u on the edge of your seat!!! Pure Awesomeness and all unexpected... Please go see what the hype is about..", "If you are following MCU since its inception, I bet you will rate it above every MCU film as it was so-fast paced that your 100% focus is needed throughout the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and there was not a single low point throughout the movie, unlike any other MCU film. Obviously I've watched every MCU movie till date so I was well-addressed with the ongoing events.  I absolutely loved Black Panther and Thor Ragnarok and they easily break into Top-6 Avengers films ever but they also had some plot draggers but Infinity War didn't. It will leave you stunned from start to the end.  For People who weren't aware of MCU, I STRONGLY recommend to not SPOIL it before watch these movies.

Very fast pace. Great story.\nVery good vilain.", "I enjoyed every bit of this film. The directors and producers did the best they could with this massive cast load and it was really fun to watch. But that being said, there are a lot of characters in this movie. With many characters that demand much screen time it was definitely a challenge to make sure that happens. I'm guessing that's why the movie was so long. I have nothing but good things to say about this movie. GO WATCH IT. The only negative is that I left the theater feeling that the movie was very crowded...because it was. The movie went all over the place and at some points you could really feel how crowded it was and it distracted you from the film. Other than that it was really well done. Thanos is definitely the best Marvel villain we've seen and it'll take a lot to top him.", "This movie was absolutely incredible! I loved it from start to finish, I think the Russo Brothers knocked it out of the park, and I can't wait for Avengers 4. SPOILERS BELOW:\nThanos is an incredible villain who actually has a motive. It's an old question that is still prevalent today about what do we do when we have too many people and not enough resources. Josh Brolin is great in this role, and the scene that stuck it for me was when he was going for the soul stone. You are convinced that he loved gamorah and that's why he had to kill her. So incredible! The character dynamics were great. The Iron Man/Spider-Man stuff is amazing, especially with Doctor Strange and the Guardians in the mix. My only grievance is that StarLord was basically so hotheaded that he just had to hit thanos right when they were so close to getting the gauntlet off. It would've been better for him to show off how badass he was again and just get it back no problem. When Tony was stabbed, I seriously thought he was dead, and I'm so glad he isn't. Thor's squad is also great, seeing the \"sweet rabbit\" stuff is amazing. I don't like teenage groot personally, but I'm glad he still was able to help out. Peter Dinklage was cool!!!  The Wakanda battle was great as well. I think that was a CGI army done right because they were so menacing as monsters in the army. Cap shines yet again, as does T'Challa and all of Wakanda. And when Thor arrives, HOLY CRAP!  Of course, I think the highlight might have to be everything in Wakanda after thanos arrives. He takes out all of the avengers like they're notbing. And poor Scarlet Witch! She has to kill Vision to save the stone, only to have to watch him die again for nothing! Absolutely heartbreaking. And seriously, Thor, next time go for the head. I seriously didn't think they had the guts to actually do the snap. I am in the camp that everyone pre-snap (Loki, vision, heimdall, gamorah, etc) are all dead, and anyone post snap COULD come back (there aren't any guarantees). But I didn't care at the time. My heart was leaping out of my chest, my throat was so lumped, the way it was done was so beautiful. Tom Holland sold his death very well, and I think all of them were very well done. The end credit scene is great, and I have no idea what's gonna happen next! Overall, this is a fantastic movie, maybe Marvel's best ever. I can't wait for Avengers 4, and I hope for some answers!!!", "The best hero movie ever, i never expect the movie be like that exceptional movie ,amazing story,", "It surprised me, very good job. whatever it takes, watch this god damn movie", "Looking forward for part two\nWe love each part of it and the comic era is and add value we understand the food drama and eliminating half of the galaxy but avebgaers tram works is amazing", "Avengers: Infinity War continues with the adventures of Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) & the rest of the Avengers. The evil intergalactic titan Thanos(Josh Brolin), sets out to find the all-powerful Infinity Stones. The Avengers have to put everything on the line to stop Thanos, before his thirst for never-ending destruction puts an end to all life on Earth.  Avengers: Infinity War is an awe-inspiring film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us the most ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date. The final product is a dark, funny, action-packed & emotionally overwhelming movie. The banter among all the various Avengers & the action set pieces are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The climax of the movie just leaves you absolutely shocked & in high anticipation of next year's Untitled Avengers Movie(2019). The star-studded cast, is the main reason this movie is unforgettable. Robert Downey Jr. is outstanding as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Downey Jr. brings even more emotional depth to his usually fun-loving character, this time around. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as Thor. Hemsworth portrays a wide variety of emotions, as the film progresses. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Ruffalo provides some much needed comic relief, amidst this generally dark movie. Chris Evans is spectacular as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans continues to play his part as the first Avenger, to perfection. Scarlett Johansson is superb as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Doctor Strange. Tom Holland is amazing as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman is great as T'Challa/Black Panther. Zoe Saldana is awesome as Gamora. Karen Gillan is wonderful as Nebula. Paul Bettany is impressive as Vision. Elizabeth Olsen is spectacular as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. Anthony Mackie is good as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Sebastian Stan is outstanding as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. Pom Klementieff is great as Mantis. Dave Bautista is hilarious as Drax. Vin Diesel & Bradley Cooper are amazing as Groot & Rocket, respectively. Josh Brolin is highly intimidating & menacing as Thanos. Brolin's character is the best villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chris Pratt is hysterical as Peter Quill/Star-Lord. Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Danai Gurira, Peter Dinklage, Benedict Wong, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, Letitia Wright, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor, Carrie Coon & Winston Duke are unforgettable as, Loki, Heimdall, Okoye, Eitri, Wong, Pepper Potts, The Collector, Shuri, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight & M'Baku, respectively. Avengers: Infinity War is a must watch. Can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX 3D! Another gem in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe.", "Best movie ever! Completely went against all predictions!", "When I saw this movie I was having an emotional rollercoaster. Thanks was intimidating and just an overall excellent villain. When he got the mind stone I was like oh my god it's over. When Thor stabbed Thanos with the axe I thought it was over, but then he snapped and I was like holly crap. After the snap everything got really stupid like why did they all disappear and where did hey go. And when you just see Thanos and it ends I was so mad.", "Wow it was amazing. Cannot wait for the next movie", "Ten years and 18 films later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives audiences the mother of all crossovers with Avengers: Infinity War. All the superheros get the moments to shine while some naturally take predominance over others.\nSet in deep space, and in half a dozen lands (New York, Wakanda, Titan, Knowhere), the film presents a galactic battle for the fate of the universe that throws together the six original Avengers; the follow-up wave of Marvel superheroes. There were so many character arcs in this movie. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Thanos is arguably the main character, which is both a blessing and a curse. Superhero films have only ever been as good as their villain, and Thanos is a tremendous villain. Josh Brolin is truly terrifying in the part, in more ways than one. He is a purple Titan masterfully delivered with chilling touches of humanity, but one that constantly maintains the capability of reaping chaos as easily as he can snap his fingers.  Thor is able to shine on his own, as is Zoe Saldana's Gamora, while other characters stand out based on their encounters and new relationships. Thor after getting revived from by the guardians set it's course to Nidavellir to forge the Stormbreaker. This movie is a total Thor Ride. His entry sequence in Wakanda was awe-inspiring.  Tony Stark never fails to impress, his involvement in the scenes makes those scenes a bliss. His humor never fails. His care for Spiderman shows his mental state of how much Spidey means to him. Captain's Entry scene was the highlight. His screen timing was perfect. The fight scene in Wakanda was fabulous.  Doctor Strange from his opening scene to his last sequence was prodigious. He is the master of this art. His sacrifice of the time stone for Tony was unimaginable. Every other characters were highly notable. Be it Natasha, Banner, Star Lord. Only con was the humor of Drax was sometimes out of phase. But the pros overshadow these cons so perfectly that it hardly matters. Though Thanos gets all the infinity Stones but he did went through a lot of damage. And his stakes were high. \nThanos getting the soul stone at his highest stake \"A soul for the soul\" by sacrificing Gamora was the thing no one would have expected.  Climax was breathtaking. The dark order of thanos Maw, Proxima, Corvus was Amazing. Especially Maw his dialogues were so effortlessly delivered. \nMarvel Delivers a dark movie with many jaw dropping scenes. CGI never failed for a second.  As dense as Infinity War might be, the characters are mostly scattered to different locations throughout.  This was total Thanos's movie. A breathtaking wholesome ride. Thanos is arguably one of the greatest villians.  This movie is worth the hype. Thanos Rips it.", "This movie took me on a ride my shoulder muscles are soar my head hurts and my freakin heart hurts! The ending will destroy any true fan of these films! But they did a fantastic epic job from hiding it from us! My mom was so upset I couldn't believe it! And not gonna lie I cried a few times! Especially the Spider-Man part! Be prepared for this film! It won't go the way you want it too!", "Avengers: Infinity War, the breathtaking action packed world phenomenon. Avengers: Infinity War follows the Avengers after the accords as they face a new threat: Thanos, the space invader who is on a quest to collect all the infinity stones so he may rule all with unlimited power. The movie literally will have you on the edge of your seat. The director(s) did a great job of juggling all the characters and creating great collaborations between the beloved heroes. This film is one great team up that will have you in awe and in tears. If there's one thing I advise for viewers who plan on watching the film is: be prepared for one BIG cliffhanger. When I went to watch the film the audience was struck with a hint of anger and a touch of excitement in the end. The film does have twists, suspense, awesome fighting scenes, and great laughs that will have you begging for more and wishing the second part to the film would come sooner than next year. The time is coming for the avengers to end and almost time for an emotional goodbye. I highly recommend the film even if you haven't gotten around to the previous films in the series. Watch it and love it! \"In time, you will know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right. Yet to fail all the same. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.\"\n-Thanos, Avengers: Infinity War", "It's not often that movie franchise with 18 movies already creates something fresh. Avengers: Infinity War is exactlty that. A fresh creation from the Russo brothers who excellenty craft a film of immense build up and hype around it. They effortlessly get the best from their cast, many of whom who have not had on screen interactions together. The result is a massively enjoyable journey in which you're given moments of hunour, joy and the inevitable sadness. The on screen cast of what may be the best ensemble cast of our time, works incredibly well with chemistry which for some takes two or three films to develop. Infinity war delivers, whether your a lifelong fan of marvel stemming from the comics, the MCU or quite simply a one off movie goer this film is a delight. Marvel have created something fresh and just as exciting, if not more so than the first Iron Man movie ten years ago. Thanos is without a doubt the best MCU villain, making all who come before him look like a weak pretender and he the true big bad. The Russo Brother's portrayal of him is perfect, instead of him being 'Mad' the way he is in the comics. They attempt to humanise the mad titan, almost making you undertand his goals, almost. Josh Brolin's performance is brilliant, his delivery of the lines makes Thanos a modern day Darth Vader. A being torn by his beliefs into something so twisted that nothing will get in his way. The tone of the film was perfect, hopelesness was looming over all but despite this our Avengers never give up. For the pressue from inside and outside for this film to succeed, the Russo brothers deliver an effortlessly crafted masterpiece. That has rasied the bar for all over superhero films that will follow it. Bravo to all involved. As this behemoth culmination of work, leads to the best superhero film of our time. \nWell, until Avengers 4 perhaps. \nGo and see this film, you will not be dissatisfied.", "Wow. I'm having trouble deciding whether I want to give this one 9 or 10 stars, but I know those are my only options for a film of this grand scale. Where do I even begin a review for this film?  Let's start with the pacing. The Russo Brothers proved they can handle directing a film with a huge ensemble cast with Captain America: Civil War, and one-upped themselves with Avengers: Infinity War. Despite the film carrying the weight of the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and other Marvel characters of equal importance such as Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, and despite the film having roughly 5 different storylines all happening at the same time, the film handles it quite well and gives each storyline enough screentime with enough spacing. The film does feel long, but, at this point, you don't want it to end! Thanos is by far done justice in this film; it's evident the Russo Brothers prioritized developing Thanos as a character with twisted but understandable philosophical motivations. The film dedicates great care in fleshing him out as a character rather than leaving him as some one-dimensional \"big baddie.\" Infinity War also makes Thanos an actual threat, and this was the first Marvel movie for me in which I thought the stakes were at its highest; the characters we've grown to love through this franchise are seen at their most vulnerable against Thanos, and that's emotionally terrifying to watch. Avengers: Infinity War is just as much about the spiritual and emotional journey Thanos goes through searching for the Infinity Stones as it is about the Avengers. With all the darkness that I seem to point out in this film, this film still has the characteristic Marvel quips. It became fan service many times as I'm sure fans imagined how their favorite characters would interact upon meeting each other, and many of these came to life, much to the pleasure of the audience. One of my favorite things about the Russo Brothers' direction is their action. The action sequences are framed excellently and add to the brutality of the Infinity War. I was interested in seeing how they would direct these more cosmic and special effects-laden action sequences, given, within the scope of Marvel, most of their prior action sequences in The Winter Soldier and Civil War were more practical and focused on hand-to-hand combat choreography. That said, they used the superpowered special effects efficiently without any excess. There are countless action sequences I couldn't wait to see happen on screen, and they completely delivered in emotional weight as well as in sheer energy. There are some flaws that I felt were a part of the film. There are several characters that feel underused in the film's plot. Some characters are just there without really adding so much purpose to the film's plot, and are limited to minor plot points or one-line quips at best.  The film ends on a cliffhanger and essentially relies on the necessity of a sequel rather than a mere implication of one, but we already knew that going in. Still, even though I knew well in advance that a sequel would be coming, I can't help but feel unsatisfied by the cliffhanger ending and, because I knew there would be a sequel, it made me less emotionally invested in the events in the film because I know there's \"more to come.\" Given that all Marvel movies previously ended on a non-cliffhanger note, I admire that this film adds something new to the mix and ends it on such a cliffhanger, but at the same time dislike it for the feeling that it lacks completion in the story. It's like the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the MCU. Certainly the \"climax\" of a larger story arc, and in hindsight perhaps the best of the franchise once we see the rest of the story arc. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War retains the Marvel charm and organic humor we've come to love as fans of the MCU, while setting a new standard for our conception of Marvel films with a level of intensity and emotional weight in the storyline. It is Marvel's darkest, most emotional and intense film to date, and you'll enjoy each and every 156 minutes of it and leave the theater wanting (or, in this case, needing) more. 9.5/10", "\"In time you will know what its like to lose, to feel so desperate that you're right but to fail all the same, dread it, run from it destiny still arrives\" WOW marvel it's taken you 18 film's to get a real balance in your films, Infinity war is truly worth the hype. For years ive been a DC fan more because of the tone of those movies I found were better for the villains with that dark tone in the films, yes they struggle to get their film right but it the overall tone and ground storeys that draw me toward DC more than marvel film. Don't get me wrong I don't hate Marvel films, I just didn't feel they had this ground story that really draws the audience in, they only really appealed to certain fans. I'm pleased to say that Avengers infinity war is the first Marvel film that hasn't used the typical cheesy over baring childish humour that make the film a comedy and not an action film. From the get-go, this film seriously dives in from where we were left in Thor Ragnorok with a seriously dark tone scene that arnt normally seen in a Marvel film, This really does help with the tone of Thanos and the way he's portrayed in this film with the black order, who throughout the film you can understand why he choose them as generals without even having to know about the comic books. This is great for those people that have never read a comic book because you get a feeling from this guys but the way they are on the screen which gives the audience a sense of dread to the dark tone of the film. Thanos himself from the previous film's when we have seen him is nothing compared to how we see him here, whats great about this which most comic book readers will possibly hate its the characters driven motives. Compared to the way he is in the comic book which is different in the film, I feel this new version is better, this is because it gives the story a solid foothold and ground story of why he's doing what he does, which is what made kill monger from black panther a good villain. Having a motive for a character to be the way he or she is, is great for the story progression, Especial for the way Thanos is portrayed here, this gives the hero's a motive to band together to stop Thanos at all cost. There is a real threat feeling in this film which is helped by the dark tone, it's refreshing to see a director using this for once, this is because using a light tone just to make the film lighter sadly you don't get this feeling. Ya, there are a few humour moments which I can honestly say are better timed than any other Marvel film, plus they were natural funny moments even I laugh. For the first time, a marvel film actually made me cry with Vision and Scalet witch, these scenes alone has so much passion and heartfelt tone you can but help has tears in your eyes, this is because love is the most powerful thing ever to lose it is the most heartbreak thing ever. The other few things you will notice is thor would be a perfect fit for the guardian of the galaxy, he would fit in so way with those guys its unreal, you notice from these scenes that they work well together which if there is any future for Thor being in the MCU, we should by all mean have thor join the guardian of the galaxy as I personally think he would be a great choice. The visual effects and back storeys are brilliantly done, as well as some returning characters from previous films and a surprising character return which most people have been wondering about for ages was a welcome addition to the film in kind of a creepy way. Be warned this film very natural unlike winter soldier does have a very blick outlook and tone due to the nature and concept of the film, this truly is one of the most darkness marvel films you see it works for the character of Thanos. But as ive sad there are a few humorous moments that break this up a bit, but the ending may disappoint you as it one of those film endings that has a WTF moment and unexpected which leaves you with a feeling of despair. Although you may feel this when leaving the cinema or after watching on DVD/ Blu-ray if you don't watch it at the theatre, Don't despair too much as there is Avengers infinity war part 2 coming in 2019. All cast involved in this film pulled off the best performance of their career. \nDislikes: I kind of didn't find the ending a little disappointing, especially leaving you with a deeper feeling that what the hell out they gonna do now, which thankfully there is a part 2 because they cant leave it like that. But the real flaw that I wanted to bring up was a certain C.G.I moment with Bruce Banner if you have seen the film is pretty much in your face, there was a bad green screen effect with CGI that just looks bad on screen it might have been something the editing team missed.", "The Russo brothers did a great job with The Winter Soldier and Civil War and they've outdone themselves with the 3rd and by far most ambitious and successful Avengers movie. As my brother put it, this movie has all the best qualities of Marvel superhero movies but with few or none of the weaknesses. That's pretty accurate. There's a lot of humour in this one and it works really, really well. I laughed out loud many times, more than for many good comedies. What makes it great is that it's all character and situation based. They aren't just stupid gags or forced jokes but natural humour based on how the characters really would react to the many crazy things which happen. The Guardians of the Galaxy practically steal the show although the chemistry between many of the other characters is great as well, with a lot of funny one-liners and one-upmanship. This focus on characters also applies to the action. Every superhero gets to show off their skills in cool, impressive ways. The integration of the airport scene from Civil War is used all the way throughout this movie. We often cut between different parts of the action, seeing the other events clearly in the background. It all comes together really well. Infinity War outdoes the solo movies for most characters, meaning Spider-man is way cooler in this than in Homecoming and the same goes for Dr. Strange and many others. Thanos is a great villain and very intimidating. I really like Josh Brolin's performance. He's calm and confident with a clear goal in mind. And we get some insight into his motives showing that he's not purely evil. However, his justifications are stupid - I feel like he could be stopped if people just explained some basic economics to him and showed him some Thomas Sowell videos. The Malthusian trap and other similar theories about impending over-population have been common since 1798 and have never come true. Consider densely populated places like Japan and Hong Kong which have high standards of living and some sparsely populated African countries like Namibia which are dirt poor. The Nazis wanted Lebensraum but prosperity has nothing to do with living space and everything to do with free trade. But anyway... The music is better than average for these superhero movies but NOTHING compared to the days when movie themes were actually memorable. I could recognise the Avengers theme but little else. It's completely pathetic compared to Superman (1978), Batman (1989), Spider-man (2002) and other John Williams series like Star Wars and Harry Potter. Those movies have multiple recognisable and hummable themes, often a main theme, love theme and themes for major good guys and villains. But Infinity War is great in other areas. I just reminisce about when movie music swept you away rather than being the same kind of generic mish-mash of Hans Zimmer-esque action music for every movie... The bad guys who support Thanos were awesome. Ebony Maw was especially cool with all kinds of insane powers that he casually brings out. I liked the look of them, not really like anything I've seen before. It reminds of how the image of little green aliens is so pervasive and common in TV shows and movie. For example, Independence Day, Signs and War of the Worlds all have fairly typical alien creatures. But the grey guys in Infinity War are very cool and memorable. The CGI is very good overall, but I still wish they'd include more real elements. It doesn't compare to Nolan's movies which are often more gripping because they are largely done for real. His movies will last a long time whereas CGI effects are destined to date rapidly. The story is ambitious and doesn't really hold back. The stakes are high and some parts of the movie are quite heavy. I'm really excited to see where they're planning on going for the next movie. The girl next to me was on the edge-of-her-seat, often covering her mouth and gasping or swearing as various beloved characters have their lives threatened. The stakes are higher I suppose because so much time has already been invested into these characters. I had similar emotional reactions seeing battles in the 7th season of Game of Thrones, not knowing if main characters would make it out alive or not. This is a one-of-a-kind superhero movie event. It's a great action/comedy spectacle made by the best directors of Marvel movies so far. All the characters are at their physical/comedic peak and are mostly used to full effect (with a few exceptions). I'm not surprised that Infinity War has reached #10 on the top 250. It's just too amazing in its strengths for its weaknesses to hold it back. Apart from Nolan's more serious films, this is the new standard for epic, fun superhero movies.", "Lengthy, but worth the watch. Packed with action and humour.", "This probably one of the best Marvel movie of all times.\nThanos was Amazing Villian.\nThat Movie is Epic, phenomenal, Non Stop Action scene, Darkest scene and shocking twist scenes and ending was very nice.", "Avengers Infinity War is a movie most fans have been waiting for since the first Avengers came out in 2012.(At least I've been waiting that long.)

Much like Joker for the DC universe. THANOS delivers! What a monster! What an evil, diabolical, powerful monster! The chaos he brings with him was something I have yet to experience in a Marvel film and I LOVED IT! \nI must give praise to the Russo Brothers for handling the balance of all these characters in this film in a way that Whedon succeeded in the first Avengers but failed to do in the Age of Ultron. Every character was crucial to the outcome.\nBalance is the key to the success of this film. It's what Thanos sought after and its what was executed perfectly in regards to the writing and directing of this film. The balance between humor and drama was spot on making the final 10 minutes that much more of a gut punch! I loved every single minute of this film! To have an event built up for 10 years and to be successfully executed is something to admire and awe over. Infinity War was simply perfect!", "Incredible.If Avengers was the first successful comic book team-up movie, then Infinity War is the first successful live-action comic book event. This movie achieves exactly what it set out to do, and with so many characters in play, it is an absolute miracle it is not a complete mess. When taken as a stand-alone movie, it probably doesn't deserve this score and the same is true if you aren't fully invested, but as an MCU fan, I really can't give it any less. I don't think there has been another movie quite like it.", "Best movie i seen so far it is so awesome a lot action it is very funny it has shocking ending it is very heartbreaking it will make you it me cry but i still love it", "Best Marvel movie ever made this movie is nuts the story telling and action sequences are smooth and epic truly an epic collision with thanos all characters are great in this movie everyone did so good loved it", "What a Movie i didn't watch Like these type of Movie in My life.

It's a masterpiece from the point of view of Sam. The role of all the characters is perfect in itself. I hope Thanos is doing this and I am trying to convince myself that the universe is the owner. Can you be happy after you have done these for the death? Let's see what I will live in Part 2. It is a long time to wait for another year.", "Avengers started off REALLY great, gets a LITTLE long in the tooth after an hour and a half and wraps up with a HEAVY but at the same time rather anti-climactic ending that feels incomplete as a movie... pretty good but not GREAT. First hour was dynamite though.", "If you love marvel and have watched all the other movies you'll love it.", "Really liked the movie except my issue was that,Thanos, the most powerful titan in the galaxy and his powerful Black Order,couldnt kill one enhanced human during battle? NOT EVEN ONE? How unrealistic is that. Even Tony Stark got skewered but managed to live. Regardless of the end result,at least one or two should have died valiantly during battle.", "With a never ending horde of superhero characters, you could call this the biggest superhero ensemble in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Heck, even without the searing white excitement generated by all the hype, this was going to be the superhero event of the year. Anyway you look at it, Avengers: Infinity War is the biggest, baddest, boldest superhero film in a long time.  And it's a long time coming with 19 preceding films in three phases over the last 10 years - it was all coming down to this. Viewers who stayed back for the post credits scene during those films (now a Marvel gold standard), were already in on it, and will be the most rewarded during this film. Although the plotline is simple, old and tired - ala save the world from an intergalactic despot - the mythology behind the story and how it is penned for the screen is by the far the best part about this film, and perhaps one of the best from the MCU. Equally praise worthy is the writing and rendition of Thanos, who is not only the best villain in the franchise but somehow the central character too. What makes Thanos even more lovable (as a villain you love to hate to love) is his human-like flaws despite his colossal repute as the most destructive and feared force in the universe. Even better is the fact that amongst the entire star cast (count at least 25 top name appearances) Thanos, voiced by Josh Brolin, is entirely CGI rendered yet still remains at the forefront of this film. In some ways, and despite the atrocities committed by Thanos, you still find a soft corner and empathetically sound reasons to believe why he does what he does. Now this is the modus operandi of a true villain and not even the avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy teamed together can stop him.  Despite the expected humour throughout the film, those atrocities make Avengers: Infinity War the darkest film in the MCU. This means viewers and fans will have to brace themselves for quite a few unexpected turns in the story, some of which may seem straight out of a Greek tragedy. That is the nature of this film, and at times irresistibly devastating. However prepared you think you are, and no matter what you've heard before going to watch this film, Avengers: Infinity War is always two steps ahead. Just like Thanos. I can hardly wait to see his reincarnation as Cable.", "How could they kill my dude, spidey, he was so cool, Bring him back ples....", "It was a great movie, but if you hadn't seen most of the previous films, you might feel like you don't know anyone. There is so much action, it's almost an overload. I would have preferred a bit more character interaction. I understand the limitations the filmmakers were dealing with; but it was hard to feel invested in the characters; I brought my investment in from previous films. Ultimately it felt like most everyone was in a cameo role.  That being said, if I were not aware of movies yet to come, I'd need therapy after seeing this. I give mad respect to everyone for keeping the important things a secret. Only spoiler I am going to drop .... 4 will definitely be a continuation, otherwise this one makes no sense. Final analysis, totally worth seeing.... but emotionally exhausting.", "Really good, wasn't bored at any point, if your a marvel fan this movie is a must see", "This film was just blockbuster perfection, after age of ultron and civil war i thought... maybe marvel peaked with the first avengers. This betters that by a country mile.  People are whinging that the film struggles to balance the cast and that the plot is all over the place. Incorrect, nothing felt forced and all of the little meet ups between characters were so satisfying. The action, obviously was brilliant. Love watching all the little bits of teamwork. \nAlso Thanos is genuinely interesting, not just a CGI baddie that punches things (he does throw a moon though!), he has his motivations and shows some emotion at times. Where will they go next ??????????", "Mind blown!! Bring on the next one!! Lived up to every expectation - the cinema in stunned silence - the visuals and story line surpassing all before. Thank you too all the great creative minds in the world.", "Amazing.... so many twists and turns and as funny as ever...why isn't it 2019 already!", "This movie did not mess around from the beginning to the end. What I appreciate about this movie is that it does show any appreciation to the characters, owing it to the upcoming films and their present budget. Josh Brolin was a wonderful Thanos, negate any expectations I had prior to walking into the cinema. Russo brothers did excellent in setting up the story arc for the rest of the Marvel universe.  All in all, one of the best Marvel movies I've seen. It is definitely up there with Civil War and Winter Soldier.", "A fantastic sequel and one of the finest of the MCU. It was not perfect but it was hell of a fun film with more twists than all those films combined. I think it was a very challenging task to bring all these characters together but it worked. I really loved the new combinations and relationships of the different characters which were incredibly dynamic. Also the portray of Thanos was fantastic. Sure they could have worked a little more on the effects but he way the character was written was excellent and extremely unexpected because it was not the kind of one dimensional and boring villain I would have expected. They really gave him a lot of soul and possibly more than any of the other characters with the exception of Zoe Saldana's Gamora, which marks Saldana's best turn with that character. Robert Downey Jr. was his usual self but more fun than in this latest Tony Stark appearances. Chris Evans was rather boring. Chris Hemsworth was pretty fine. Chris Pratt (jeez too many Chris's) was funny and self ironic. Scarlett Johansson was a bit wasted. I am not really fond on the direction they develope Bruce Banner/Hulk and Ruffalo can do better. Nice to see Chadwick Boseman so short after his own adventure again. Tom Holland really developed into the best Spider-Man. Really liked his performance here again. \nThe visuality was great. Most of the action scenes just brilliantly executed. The score was great. I had many shivers down my spine. The ending was shocking , but I somehow can imagine how they will continue and in which direction the last sequels goes. Great entertainment with a lot of tense, heart, soul and surprisingly moving moments.", "The epic movie we have been waiting for.Stay till the end", "To call this an Avengers movie feels a bit off. The Avengers are in it for sure, as are the Guardians of the Galaxy, but this is more Thanos' film. He takes centre stage, soaking up all the best parts. Even when he's not on screen, his presence permeates and threatens. His quest for the Infinity Stones has officially begun. The film opens with him already having taken the Power Stone from Xandar, and is well on his way to getting the Space Stone from Loki. As openings go, this is up there for establishing the sheer threat Thanos poses to each and every character we've grown to love over the last decade. I mean, the guy beats Hulk into a pulp without using any stones at all, and he only grows more and more powerful as the film goes on. The stakes have never been higher in an MCU movie. The threat of permanent character death is very, very real, and no-one is above it. I won't spoil who dies, but some are easy guesses, and others come out the left field. In truth there's definitely a sense of unpredictability thanks to the pure power Thanos can unleash. He quite literally crashes a moon down into a planet, turns weapons into bubbles, and by the end can even rewind time to suit his needs. And of course that fabled snap of the fingers marks the climax of the movie. But the real strength of Thanos comes from the treatment of his character. He could quite possibly be the single greatest villain in the MCU thanks to how he's developed. He's unyielding and horrifically strong even without the power of the gauntlet, but he also shows vulnerabilities, and acts out of a misplaced sense of moral philosophy. He's not just evil for evil's sake, he has clear definable goals that aren't entirely incorrect. He seeks balance and paradise, ultimately just wanting to make the universe a better place for everyone. He cares about life in all its forms and sees what he's doing as a necessary evil to save everyone. What really took me aback is how emotional the movie is (Oh boy, spoilers). While it doesn't let up in it's unrelenting fight scenes and sense of dread, it still takes the time to ponder on how it makes everyone feel. I actually really felt for Gamora and Thanos respectively, not just at poignant moments, but in general considering everything they've endured together. When Gamora appears to kill Thanos, it's not triumphant but full of grief. While she hates him to the end, he was still her father figure. Likewise when he has to sacrifice her later on, he mourns throughout the rest of the movie, because he really did love his favourite daughter. She wasn't just a tool for him; he forgave her betrayals precisely because he loved her so much. As misguided as his methods seem, he still managed to show a human element that not only made him relatable, but also made him oddly likeable - he shows a vulnerability beneath his powerful capabilities that gives him the greatest depth of any MCU villain. But above all it was Peter Parker that broke me, watching those around him fade out of existence, and then feeling the very same come over him - heightened by his enhanced senses. He's just a scared teenager facing the ultimate existential crisis, and his pleading to stay genuinely made my tear ducts fill. Dear god Tom Holland can act. And yet through all of the dread, the constant threat of death, and the sheer emotional heartbreak, Infinity War manages to keep its head above water with succinct, natural humour that manages to make you laugh out loud. Of course a lot of this is down to simple character interactions, like Rocket asking to buy Bucky's metal arm, or Star-Lord becoming envious of Thor's physique. This is the Avengers movie where unrelated franchises smash together and we're gifted with odd interaction after odd interaction, and each and every one manages to find humour without forcing it out Entertaining character interactions aren't just restricted to comedy though. The Avengers movies, as well the various team-ups between them, have been defined by how each hero comes together as a cohesive team when taking down a foe, whether it's Thor and Captain America creating a shockwave between hammer and shield, or Hawkeye shooting Ant-Man into Iron Man's suit. Infinity War is no exception, and the behemoth cast extends the options a little further. Doctor Strange creates portals for Spider-Man to jump through and stepping stones for Star-Lord, Bucky dual-wields a machine gun in one hand and Rocket in the other, Bruce Banner takes the Hulkbuster out for a spin when Hulk refuses to show up, Groot creates a weapon handle for Thor out of his own arm, as well as quite a few others. On that note, the action is simply top-notch. It's unrelenting from the Thanos vs Hulk fight in the opening all the way up to the infamous snap. There always seems to be an action scene going on somewhere, and the character combos I mentioned above are only scratching the surface of the amount of cool stuff that goes on. Thanos himself is a powerhouse, especially once he gets the reality stone, and the way he uses them all is hugely creative. There's one particular fight between Thanos and Doctor Strange that is the epitome of mind-bending as they hurl spells at one another (in Doctor Strange's case, literally). It's all so fluid and stylish. Not only that but the epic scale and unrelenting nature of the action scenes make it feel like an actual war rather than just a small skirmish at an airport, and how it managed to fit it all in and make space for the more emotional beats without ruining the pace blows my mind. Top notch editing for sure. The CGI is pretty incredible for the most part as well. The Black Order are brought to life by their visual effects, but it's Thanos who really shines, showing each and every hair on the back of his neck and side of his face. The sheer attention to detail is staggering. Beyond that the CGI doesn't stifle Josh Brolin's ability to act at all, and Thanos' personality is palpable through his facial expressions alone. On the other side of the coin though, there's some truly terrible visual effects work when it comes to Hulkbuster and Warmachine. There's a shot very late on where Banner and Rhodey appear in their armour without helmets on, but the blending is so bad that their heads just look stuck on. This corner-cutting for some of the visual effects, especially considering how utterly fantastic other effects are, is pretty much my only criticism of the whole movie. But I think I've rambled on enough. Infinity War was everything I wanted it to be and more. It surpasses every other effort in the MCU (a claim I really hope I don't go back on as the film sinks in over time and multiple rewatches). Thanos is the greatest villain there is, showing heartbreaking vulnerabilities as well as being a complete and utter badass (although his line about putting a smile on his face was irksomely absent), the humour is genuinely very funny, but also natural and comes about organically through simple character interactions, the stakes are real as characters do die, permanently, and the status quo is forever changed by the movie's close. I don't feel it's that bold a claim to say Infinity War is the MCU's Empire Strikes Back in more ways than one. I almost want to give it a perfect 10/10 straight out of the gate, but for now I'll settle for a still extremely respectable 9/10. My heart was genuinely racing long after the credits rolled, and that can only be a good sign.", "Heart was in my mouth from the word go and didn't leave there till the after credits scene wrapped up. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and experience most of the emotions in between by the time the 2 hr 29 minutes run time fly's by. By far the best marvel movie to date and will be seeing this movie at least one more time before it leaves the theatres. \nPs. I hate you Thanos", "SPOILER FREE review Let's clarify first: This film is an important part of series of MCU films. Watching as standalone movie is not recommended. Just like you will not watch only the last episode of Game of Thrones.\nWatch the previous films before Infinity War!! (you can skip Iron man 2-3, Incredible Hulk tough) So what can i tell about the movie? I got everything i expected, everything i hoped for, everything i dreamed of and even much more: What i expected: \nA MCU film with well placed humor, awesome fight scenes, well done CGI. What i hoped for: \nI hoped they can handle the awesome amount of characters while they had to build up Thanos too. I can tell you guys, character chemistry is working (my favourites Strange-Ironman-Starlord; Thor-Rocket Raccoon), \nI hoped for an good challenging villain. I got it, Thanos is one of the best MCU villain every way.\nI hoped for a fast paced story, full of tragic moments (PEGI 16), surprising\nstory events. Marvel got balls, this style should be forced for later mainstream films. (More jokes, lighter tone should be made at standalone movies, like Ant Man, Spiderman Homecoming etc.)  What i dreamed of:\nUsually these are story elements, and spoiling them would be a sin. and much more:\nWe have new side character and his own tragedy and there is one guy you will never see that coming.\nClever use of Infinity Stones\nInteresting places\nBackstories\n... So as a summary i can say this film is beyond any expectation, there are only minor flaws which are acceptable comparing to the job they did . This is so epic, spectacular for becoming the a comparison basis for later films. \"There is no decision making process here\", this is a 10/10 film ( I only gave 10/10 for the \"Avengers\" among superhero movies before)", "I consider Deadpool the best Marvel movie because it ironically exposes us to the fact that we enjoy watching fictional characters jump around, say stupid heroic lines and save people. It gives us the phylosophical questions: \"Why can't we enjoy our current reality?\" or \"Is our reality/story more real than Deadpool's?\" I think it is pretty obvious, we use these stories to create a non-religious (for most people lol, shoutout to geeks:) mythology. Altough nowadays Marvel movies have come closer to not taking things seriously, there's still some overly serious attitude involved in \"saving\" the world. Of course, the best part about this one is that it's underlying question is serious, and the dialog always tries to joke, just like in the comics, just like Deadpool. And the meaning behind this movie's story? It's probably the dilemma of the Christ and the anti-Christ. Thanos's motivation for destroying half the living population in the universe is purely economical: he wants the living to prosper, he deems a universe wide Holocaust necessary. All this, after gaining the highest power known in the universe, which means theoretically he could have found other solutions to his dilemma, but for some reason he seems to be set on being a lunatic. And here comes our dilemma: why is he so sure that killing people is the only solution? Which is never explained. On the hero side, they don't really get why Thanos is doing what he is doing either, and they don't really get to participate in a philosophical debate about the topic. The action is relentless, and the visuals are decent, so it works as the blockbuster they promoted it to be. I gave it 7/10 because the most important character's motivations (Thanos) remained only briefly explored. The cheesy lines remained low, but that's because they kept romantic lines to the minimum, otherwise it would have been really bad (why can't anyone write a normal romantic dialogue? adults should have adult dialogues, not be like Vision, who is an AI and rambles like a teenager). I particularly liked the ending, despite the fact that we know this is not the true ending to the story.", "I think this film is brilliantly executed, with many gasp, cheer and laugh moments. How it's truly viewed will be after the next film comes out to see if that ending was worth it.", "This was a good movie. Marvel and Disney did a good one here. The comeback from boringly predictable flicks with forced jokes of phase 3 (I am looking at you Ragnarok) is good. It still had more jokes that I would like in a movie that is about destroying half the universe but then again you cannot have a Disney movie without jokes. Every character is sometimes comedic relief. As a standard Marvel/Disney movie. But it's not too overdone. Now for the story, don't forget it's Part 1.\nI will not spoil the story for anyone here. Now do not go in this one expecting Godfather or (as a superhero movie) Dark Knight or any top 20 IMDB movies quality acting and story (although probably the fan boys will send this one up there). But it is one of the best MCU movies to date (not the best super hero movie or the best Marvel superhero movie, but specifically to MCU)", "Just unbelievable. The best of the marvel bunch, everything you could have hoped for.", "Another great superhero movie of all time. Full of actions from the beginning till the end.", "Yeeeeeeah I liked it. It was pretty good. Some pointless scenes, subplots etc but overall... I liked it. The visuals are stunning, I wasn't even watching in 3D or IMAX and my socks were blown off. It was a bold move, mixing everybody together in new places not even on earth- moving away from the more realistic side that was established originally. But it paid off. It did have emotional effect, mostly in one scene with Spider-Man, while the other 'emotional scenes' weren't very riveting. It was full of surprises and I enjoyed it. Good job guys.", "I've watch this movie yesterday, on imax screen in indonesia...\nbecause this movie was planned years ago, all i can say that this is perfectly executed..\nall of the character has been introduced, excluding thanos... from normal people perspective, i think that thanos way to balance the universe is fair.. he loves to kill and annihilate, but it because his main objective is to maintain balance. all the hero that i predict will be dead in the movie, it turns out they didn't dead, but others.. from business perspective, Disney will grab lot of money from this movie.. investment in marketing, production etc seems small to their profit.. and on the other side, warner bros exec need to bang their head in the wall, there's no way WB and DC to reach 20% of Disney and Marvel achievement..", "Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic blockbuster.A movie that lived up above the hype. 10 years of building and they made a masterpiece.\nThanos..Thanoss.. Thanos..\nThanos brings a whole new definition to fear and destruction. Ultimate villain. There is no way you can give so much importance to a villain when you have a movie packed with heroes & there is no better way to end a film when u have a sequel ready. Hope we can fast forward 2018...Can't wait for the next one!!!", "This movie is pure perfection , the plot the action the effects the scenery are all amazing ! You cant find a single boring moment in the entire movie , the timing is what impressed me the most , with so many charactees they have managed to give them all enough screen time to satisfy every veiwer also thanos just dominated that villain curse of marvel movies.", "Having grown up with comics in my life, learning about the avengers, iron man, captain America, spider man and so on, 10 years of Marvel films - growing up with them in my life, Infinity War tops it all off.  The Russo brothers, having smashed Winter Soldier and Civil War deliver an exceptional piece of work.  We have known for a long time of Thanos' coming and boy does he deliver! Straight from the get go we encounter the Marvel villain we have been hoping for. Menacing, frightful, evil and damn right punishing! The way in which Infinity War connects each Avenger with new members like Guardians of the galaxy, Doctor Strange and the Wakandans is mesmerising. You cheer them all on from the start but in a way want to see what Thanos' main goal is throughout.  It delivers epic fight scenes, amusing comedy and great chemistry, Star Lord, Iron Man and Doctor Strange having very likeable clashing personalities and Thor continuing on from Ragnorak and his new sense of destructive 'banter'.  The film, to me, is a 10/10. Any true Marvel fan will agree and come out of the cinema filled with both sadness and pleasure.", "Cinema completely silent for the last 20 minutes. Amazing.", "First of, this film is not for casual movie goers. This is for the fans, for the people who watched every single MCU film since 2008 and anticipated for this to happen. You cannot watch this movie without having to watch atleast 8 of the previous films, in order to understand and decipher the character's progression and development. Everything that we've been watching has been leading to this moment. Us, seeing Thanos go after the Infinity Stones to fulfill his \"purpose\". The movie formally introduced us to Thanos. Majority of the film is about him and his background and motivation for wanting to annihilate half of the universe. Some might \"sympathize\" with him, but the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy know better. Thanos' backstory was great, but Thanos' children (Black Order) could've used more character development. The movie showed how powerful and vulnerable Thanos was, which makes it more interesting. It's raising the stakes even more, to get a better pay off in the end. Thanos definitely is the star of the show. He doesn't kill to hate, he kills to let people live. The way he interacted with the heroes was sympathetic and genuine, as he praised Star-Lord, admired Iron Man and Doctor Strange and sympathized with Scarlet Witch. He was a complicated character. He didn't want the infinity stones to rule the world, but rather \"fix\" it, same with Ultron's motives, but the way they developed both characters were very different. That's what makes Thanos a far better villain than Ultron or anyone else. The film perfectly ties up all previous films with hilarious and dark moments. The new \"team ups\" have great chemistry, Thor-Rocket-Groot and Doctor Strange-Iron Man-Spider Man-GoTG. The action sequences in the movie were thrilling, especially the fight in Wakanda and every Captain America fighting scene. Okoye and Black Widow are the female team up to beat. Bruce Banner is the funniest character, next to Thor. Iron Man and Doctor Strange's banters are everything we ever dreamed off. Star-Lord and Drax were a bit of a disappointment. Gamora finally got her moment. Black Panther, Falcon, Winter Soldier were side-lined. Vision was vulnerable and Scarlet Witch was unstable. Doctor Strange and Thor were the best heroes in the film, followed by Iron Man. Captain America shines during the ending, showing how defeated he felt as he saw his friend slowly disappear.  The ending was perfect. It was hard to absorb at first but it made perfect sense. Thanos fulfilled his purpose and he doesn't have to work anymore, so he finally retires. But the remaining Avengers know that they still have to find a way to bring back their friends and families. It sets up the next movie (Avengers: Secret Wars) perfectly. With the weight of everything that's happening, the pacing was not perfect but it was okay. I would've liked to see the Soul Stone make a bigger impact in the movie. We saw all of the other stones' power and capabilities but after years of waiting for the Soul Stone, it simply didn't deliver a dramatic representation of what it could really do.  The Avengers were defeated but we know that they will find a way to undo everything that Thanos did in this movie. Maybe we will get to see a timeline reset. The lack of Ant-Man and Hawkeye were so unfortunate for the heroes because they would've been so much help in fighting Thanos.  We will have to wait for a year to see what happens next to the remaining Avengers. Avengers: Infinity War may not be the best MCU film in my opinion, but it delivers what we wanted to see and it's the boldest MCU film to date!", "The Marvel Cinematic Universe started out with the first installment, Iron Man in 2008. It's been 10 years since then with 19 installments a TV show and spin-offs, now ending with, Avengers: Infinity War. The Avengers have fought villains of great magnitudes, such as Loki in Marvel's The Avengers, and the psychopathic robot, Ultron from Age of Ultron. But, nothing compares to the Mad Titan, Thanos. In Infinity War, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is a powerhouse. His motives are simple and nothing stands in his way. The way that directors, Anthony and Joe Russo portray him as the main character is a polite surprise. Instead of the Avengers being the main protagonists like the usual, Thanos is portrayed as that role, and the Avengers are the antagonists are keeping the Titan from his goals. You feel bad for Thanos and eventually, understand why he is doing what he is doing. I am definitely giving this a 10/10.", "TONY STARK ROBERT DOWNEY JR INCREDIBLE AS ALWAYS BEGINNING TILL END, \nTHANOS JOSH BROLIN LOOKED TOUGH WITH THREATENING DIALOGUES THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL THE CHRIS ( CHRIS PATT , CHRIS EVANS , CHRIS HEMSWORTH) IS AMAZING , CHRIS PATT ( STAR LORD ) WITH JOKES AND BEING SMART AND UPLIFTING THE MOVIE , THOR BEING FUNNY , POWERFUL AND GOING FOR THE KILL ,CHRIS EVANS CAPTAIN AMERICA WAS MORE STRONG AND POWERFUL THAN LAST TIME.

The story and action are superb.", "Cons:\nThe effects are good, the fights are cool.\nPros:\nThe deaths of the main characters have no weight.\nThe story is kinda dumb", "Avengers: Infinity War is unlike anything you have ever seen and possibly will ever see! It delivers on the action, the drama, the suspense and the humour. The Russo Brothers have yet again delivered. Anyone who thinks this is not an amazing movie is talking complete nonsense.\nThanos is the best villain in the history of villains. He has emotions like a normal person, yet acts like a madman. But what he's doing, he thinks it's the only way to protect the universe, that's waht makes him a great villain.\nOverall, I would give this an eleven out of ten if I could.", "Marvel's Fans are going to love this movie, moreover Thanos' fans.\nThis is the story of the Great Titan, the Mad Titan, and how he get all Infinity Stones. I'm pretty sure that Endgame is going to be way better, but this was a MASTER PIECE.", "A decade worth of waiting has never felt soo good, nonstop action from the moment the movie begins, it redeemed marvels last cliffhanger with some amazing action from the start", "The MCU has been heading to this movie from Iron man part 1. This movie has an overarching sense of doom and heartbreak right from it's first scene. But it still takes you along for a rollercoaster ride with fun and light-hearted moments. In my opinion Thanos is one of the most complex and well developed villains ever. You understand his motivations. You almost sympathise with him for the sacrifice of his daughter and what it cost him. Yet when you see half the universe turn to dust, you despise him. This movie is unlike any superhero movie out there. Melding every single character and setting into a seamlessly perfect movie that any superhero lover should watch. Even in absolute loss, there is hope. Can't wait for endgame!", "Great movie, but very depressing. The heartbreak throughout the movie is incredible.", "This would've been a fun action film if they hadn't done the obvious--pepper it with heterosexual love interests and family values which have NO place in a comic book or a good movie. You want Disney, watch Lady and The Tramp. Despite the fact that the majority of the world is straight, I still do not see why in this day and age we still have to watch men and women slather all over each other in public. What does this have to do with plot and adventure? This is why films like Lara Croft were so popular--we can relate to singles but rarely to couples. This odd belief that there are alien species that will/can procreate with humans or want to is absurd. It's akin to showing a mammal try to have sex with a plant. The writers must've been told by the producers and therefore the backers to make everything Catholic--push hetero sex and babies along with propaganda that it's wrong to get rid of half the universe population to make reality more equal and fair. The fact is that we could lose China and India tomorrow and still have too many people roaming around on the planet. Mankind in many ways is invasive like a virus. The villians in this film actually are the good guys. Fie on Hollywood. They are so owned banks and mafiosa.", "To sum up, this movie is the superhero movies GOD, I think marvel kicked the hell out of DC's butt with this one", "The story is about thanos is collecting infinity stones so he can wipe out half the universe and now the original avengers have to get help from doctor strange, spider man, the guardians of the galaxy and a bunch of others. So let me say something this movie is awsome the special affects are good and characters are good the ending was so surprising.", "Infinity war was a movie I was really looking forward too. The trailers were good but Unfortunately I found the movie disappointing. Much like the first movie, I also found this one just okay and nothing more. Infinity war was very boring at times which is strange because the trailers made the movie look like it would be action packed. The movie ended up being very overrated. I'm sorry but I'm going to have to mention Avengers Age of Ultron again. That movie has the perfect balance of action story telling, Character moments and humour, unfortunately Infinity war has the opposite. People say that Age of Ultron was a cluster f#ck of a movie but I disagree 100%. I actually thought Infinity War was the cluster f#ck. I'm sorry but I have to ask this. Why is it that most people say that Age of Ultron is overcrowded with too many characters, but they are okay with Infinity war being overcrowded???. Infinity war has hundreds of characters!! And for some reason it's NOT considered overcrowded?? But Age of Ultron is?? Age of Ultron has maybe 12 main characters tops, but infinity war has about THIRTY characters!! And if you include all of black panthers people on the field there are probably 100 characters!!. But that's all okay with everyone, people let that slide for some reason. What happened to the complaints about being OVERCROWDED?? Did that criticism fly out the window??. So everyone is okay with Infinity War being overcrowded but not when Age of Ultron does it??. I'm sorry but isn't that double standards?? And a huge contradiction??. I should also mention I never found Age of Ultron overcrowded, I thought that movie had a perfect balance and There actually were not that many characters in it. I'm sorry folks but I fail to see your overcrowded argument. Why should I go easy on infinity war when nobody went easy on Age of Ultron?. Another thing that confuses me are the people that moaned about the scene in Age of Ultron where Thor went into the water and saw these visions of weird things. People complain about that scene even though it's SHORT, but when Thor goes off by himself in Infinity War to find a new hammer everyone is okay with that????? WTF? Why are people okay with it in this movie?? But not when he does it in Age of Ultron??. IT'S THE SAME THING PEOPLE! When Thor went searching for a new hammer in this movie it was so BORING!! And it went on way too LONG!! At least when he did it in Age of Ultron it was SHORTER so it was NOT boring. When he looks for a hammer in Infinity War it goes on for what feels like an HOUR!. Yes it was THAT BORING that it felt like an hour. I don't know exactly how long it was but it was definitely LONG, lame and boring. Infinity War does have some action, but just like the first movie it does not have enough!. It has little bits of action every now and then but those scenes were not that interesting, not for me anyway. The movie does start off well, so I will give it credit for that, however the good start goes down hill very fast, which is too bad, because I really wanted to love this movie, and I only ended up calling it okay. I liked the start of the movie on the spaceship. The story continues from where Thor Ragnarock ended, and I appreciated the continuity. I thought the start was pretty cool, because we get to see Thanos and his dark order army on the ship, surrounded by bodies. We also get to see Loki talk with Thanos and his monsters. I enjoyed some of the action at the start of the movie with Thanos on the ship, and I liked the scene where Iron Man meets Doctor strange. It was a cool introduction and when they ended up working together that was cool. I personally thought they made a good team, mainly because they are so alike. I thought there were a few good funny moments between them, and I liked their banter. I also liked the Fight between Scarlet witch and the Sorceress woman. I thought the Fight was okay and kind of cool. Her boyfriend the Vision also fights one of Thanos's Creatures. I liked his fight too, unfortunately Vision had to be saved by Scarlet Witch, which was disappointing. It would have been cool if he Won his own fight. Vision was not given much to do and he was underused in my opinion. In fact a lot of characters were underused. Loki was underused, Even The Winter Soldier was underused. I also thought it was disappointing that two of the coolest characters never get to meet each other. These two are FINALLY In the same movie together and they are not in any of the same scenes together!. It would have been cool if Loki and the Winter Soldier met, since those characters are fan favourites, but no instead we are treated to the guardian's of the Galaxy showing up and being useless and annoying! Yes I'm serious! The guardians of the Galaxy were so annoying and useless in this movie. I liked them in their last movies which are better than THIS movie, but in Infinity war they were just in the way. The movie has so many problems I'm having a hard time understanding why it's on the Top 250 movies list!. It does not deserve to be on that list. Age of Ultron should be on that list And Infinity War should be knocked off the list. 1. Infinity War is way too long of a movie for starters. 2. It's too slow. 3. It's too boring. 4. their is too much stupid humour for a movie that is supposed to be serious. 5 there are way too many long drawn out and useless scenes like for example the confusion scene where the guardian's fight Iron man Doctor Strange and Spider man. That scene was NOT FUNNY, it was BORING and a complete WASTE OF TIME!. Do they not realize the world is on the brink of DESTRUCTION!!! And they are wasting time fighting each other and telling DUMB JOKES!!!. SIGH, and people say Age of Ultron is BAD???. I'm sorry folks your WRONG. Age of Ultron was FUN AND FAST PACED, and it did not have lame scenes that dragged on FOREVER. Infinity War DOES. I don't understand why everyone is okay with that. Infinity War is too SLOW. Chris Prat was NOT FUNNY, He was not entertaining either, he spent most of the film acting like a PRAT. HELLO STARLORD THE WORLD IS ON THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION CAN YOU STOP SCREWING AROUND!!. SIGH And THIS is the movie that gets a higher score than Age of Ultron???? THAT'S CRAZY!! Problem 6. The tone was uneven, meaning, the movie was too serious one minute and then too Jokey the next minute. It's like the makers of the movie couldn't decide what tone to go with so instead they just gave the movie a crazy jumbled up tone, that is constantly back and forth so many times, by the end you don't know if it's meant to be serious or silly. Problem 7. So many good characters are underused. Characters like Loki and the Winter Soldier. The Vision and even Captain America and Thor were underused. I don't like their new looks either and they spend most of their running time without their original weapons. They are either talking or walking around, never fighting. They don't fight until the end which goes back to problem 2. IT'S TOO SLOW. Black panther was also underused and Even Hulk was underused!. Problem 8. The Avengers were never all TOGETHER in this movie, they spent the WHOLE MOVIE SEPERATED! THEY WERE ALL IN DIFFERENT PLACES!. How can that not bother people????? They are called the Avengers because they are supposed to be a TEAM AND TEAMS STICK TOGETHER. In the last two Avengers movies they were always together, which is what made those movies work. Infinity War does everything backwards. problem 9. Thanos was too preachy in this movie, and he was way too boring! I did not care about his back story! Or why he was doing what he was doing. He was pretentious and he spent way too much time preaching and not enough time fighting!. I did not care about the scene where he walks of with Gamora either, that was also boring!. I didn't understand why Gamora was casually walking around with him. So what if he kidnapped her? That's besides the point! The point is she was being an IDIOT!. She did not even try to run away from him! She just walked around with him like she was taking a walk in a PARK!! IT WAS RIDICULOUS. People should stop calling Ultron Ridiculous and call THAT SCENE RIDICULOUS INSTEAD!! Just writing this review is making me tiered! but i had to knock this movie down a few peggs, because it's not THAT GOOD, IT'S OKAY AT BEST, BUT IT HAS TOO MANY SLOW SPOTS. The movie probably had five fight scenes tops and none of them were great, they were just okay scenes. I'm sorry but a few okay fights does not make a great movie, you need good writing and directing too. Most of the movie we have boring scenes of people TALKING. I Thought this was supposed to be an ACTION MOVIE. This movie should be retitled INFINITY TALKING NOT INFINITY WAR. What War are they talking about?? There was no war! There was just talking about War!. If by war they mean the Fight in Black panthers yard? That was NOTHING. It was just lame looking creatures attacking everyone in a stupid way!. Captain America has NO SHIELD IN THIS MOVIE So he gets his butt kicked! And Thor spends most of the movie with NO HAMMER!. By the time he gets a new hammer the movie is nearly over!. Thor got one good shot against Thanos but THAT'S IT. ONE HIT?? It was a good hit but it was THE ONLY GOOD HIT HE GOT!!. Apparently the Robots in Age of Ultron were lame because they were just faceless creatures?? WELL INFINITY WAR DOES THE SAME THING. THIS MOVIE ALSO HAS FACELESS CREATURES THAT THE AVENGERS FIGHT!! BUT EVERYONE IS OKAY WITH IT FOR SOME REASON. HELLO IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING FOLKS. At least the Robots in Age of Ultron put up a GOOD FIGHT, however, the creatures in this movie put up a LAME FIGHT, THERE IS YOUR DIFFERENCE. Problem 10. Infinity war has a depressing Ending which I hated. But if that's what people like, more power too them. If people love Bad endings then they will love this movie.", "I can't describe the amount of adrenaline and tension this movie brought to me. All I can say is that this is the most brilliant movie that could combine all those stars together, putting every one of them at the super role ; excellent dialogues, funny among the serious and tensioned scenes, each role at this movie cannot be taken by another actor.\nCongratulations, you deserve to get all the credits in the world", "I have followed the MCU as most people have since iron man started it all, and sure not all of them have been great (iron man 3 or Thor the dark world comes to mind) but this blew away my expectations.  This film was made to entertain and it did just that. With a pretty decent plot and fantastic action scenes it was a visual treat for the eyes. But the main reason why I loved this film was because the good guys lose. It made a change from all of the save the world and stop the bad guy stereotype story. It took an unexpected turn and has you wondering where do they go and what will happen next? \n \nSo whether you are just a casual marvel film goer or a die hard fan. This was an enjoyable ride From start to finish, films are made for us to unwind, switch our brains off, and be entertained and infinity war does just that. Its not meant to be taken seriously so I don't know why all the negativity behind it. But an essential film to watch for any movie fan.", "I had never seen such a great movie. The way the Russo Brothers connect all different Heroes with different interests together is on another level.", "I came to see the reviews to see what to expect before i saw the movie and by what people are rating this is none less than stupid, i can only summarise that the dc fanboys decided to log in and downplay this in order to make BVS not seem as bad. ive seen people give that movie a 9 yet this a 1? anyway the film is no stop action and having laid the gruondwork in previous movies they dont need a long drawn out story here and i for one am grateful, i watch these movies and a lot of fans want to see superheroes fighting against each other the dynamics of strength and abilties and clashing of egos and we get all that here, dont let reviewers who give this a 1/10 put you off seeing this i reserve those ratings for things like sharknado and other b-movies, i actually believe some of these reviewers should be banned as its obvious they have an agenda.", "Firstly to those who feel it's 'clever' to give a 1/10, why? Really? In all honesty if you are trying to make a point, let me tell you, you're not. It is stupid and infantile. This is a 10/10 banker. If you can't sit back and just enjoy this film, the humour, the effects, the great action then I could not in all honesty recommended ANYTHING for you. I am really going to look forward to the next one, at least I hope tbere IS a next one!! This was a thrill a minute, started off at 100 miles an hour and never let up. It has enough in it to keep people of all ages enthralled. So, again, 1/10? Give me a break!", "No movie can be perfect. No movie can be 10/10 but Infinity War comes close. All the surprises and action kept me on the edge of my seat (cliche but what else could I say to describe it). All I want now is to know what Stan Lee's cameo will be for Avengers 4. 'Nuff Said", "WHAT an ending! Gets 9 stars for leaving out Sean Gunn and the flying arrow. LOVE that weapon! You might as well not do a funeral for Yandu. Gunns a key member of the Gradians. Also Captain America the last thing I heard was \"and get this man his shield\" Never to be seen again. Thought that was odd. Other than that I really can't pick apart comics they come as is. THIS ONE was perfectly balanced. Rest assured though they WILL all be back. It's a time thing guys. My favorite hero is Dr. Strange. Your all gonna find out why. He sacrifices the most. How many X's did he negotiate in Dr. Strange? He died about 12 X's for the world before his time loop worked. Your gonna see the same in the next. Will it be Gradians 3? I would sure hope so. \nMovie was AWSOME! Gets 9 stars for leaving out Gunn!  \nP.S. No this review isn't a spoiler it's more like hope & realism I can only imagine how many parents are STILL promising there 10 year old's Spider Man and Groot will be back. CRYING kids screaming as they walk out of the dark theater. LOL keep your heads up. We ALL KNOW they'll be back. take care", "Where do I even begin? Avengers Infinity War is one of the best if not THE BEST Marvel movie that I have ever seen. Everything in this movie was excellent from the acting and action to the special effects and music. Josh Brolin nailed his performance as Thanos and gives one of the best supervillain portrayals.", "Its butifull and all avengers is craeted all hero and will be hero all will be great and ay will soport all", "This is so well done. The pop culture references (see aressted development).. the melding of all of the characters and movies into this mega blockbuster. Just wow. I don't review so strongly often.", "I watch 4 days ago this movie on web-dl format and I was amazed beacause of the quality of this movie! I want Marvel to do Infinity War 2", "I dont have anything to say amazing movie best movie from Marvel good job watch it watch it noooowwwww", "Well the movie we've been waiting for ... years! It's finally here and it doesn't dissapoint at all. You may nitpick and there are things to critisize as with all movies, but as a Universe Marvel did a fantastic job, setting characters up and giving us something to look for. So even the smallest things can make you chuckle (if you are like me and into that sort of stuff), like Groot and Captain America introducing themselves to each other. It's a character moment, but it's also as funny as it can be. And it is grounded into what we know about them and their attitude. So even when you have all that mayhem and all that fights going on, there is always time for other things. Quirky things, intelligent things and not just necessarily just social commentary (see Black Panther), but also dialog like the \"made up words\" argument (very fine moment indeed). And again, I'm just giving you some simple moments, that really define how well thought out this all is. Not afraid to be self deprecating at times either. If you are able to avoid spoilers, please do and watch this to be surprised, to laugh, maybe even cry a little bit, but more important of all be entertained! I guess having to watch a few movies before this may seem like a chore for some, but once you start them and are not too negative about it, you will enjoy them ... just watched Ant Man and the Wasp and that was a hoot/blast too. But now I have to wait until next year ... for Captain Marvel and the \"conclusion\" of this ... I have some ideas where it might go ... By the way there is \"only\" one scene after the movie is over and it's after the credits ... sometimes you have to have room to breathe, so right decision!", "I dont think this movie deserves this sorting on imdb vivil war was better", "If not the immortal stupidity of the actions/heroes in films, it would be a great movie(thinking out loud: just a couple of seconds it was necessary to wait, you idiot). And sometimes I felt like relevant in the previous films jokes, here often inserted just to fill the airtime. In all other respects - an excellent film.", "Dame , fire , best movie in the year 2018 \ngoods ; they showed us the movie in a smooth way and everyone got what they deserve thanos got me the chills\nbads ; not that much so you know >>>", "The culmination of ten years' worth of work there's little to say about infinity war other than the highest regards, action packed and straight to the point this film brings a great threat and a fantastic villain and was honestly a great watch at the cinema. At times tear jerking but mostly heart pounding and thrilling this is a landmark in cinema I can't speak anymore highly of it", "Avengers Infinity War is a blast from the start especially if you're a comic fan this is a blessing given to us by the Russo Brothers. This movie is darker than the rest of the MCU movies with great visuals and amazing story that will set up for the upcoming Avengers 4", "Only Avengers 4 can beat it. Period. The movie has it all. Connected timelines, story, emotions, consequences of every action and not to forget that villain toys with everyone. It's just not a happy ending movie which I might think will piss many kids off. The movie is just mind blowing.", "It has been a couple of years since I watched a Marvel movie and didn't get disappointed about shortcomings.\nInfinity War rides off the back of Thor Ragnarok (one of my lowest rated Marvel films) and Black Panther (a decent film, but flawed) both very successful and both very different in tone to each other.\nInfinity War as the third Avengers film does something that you don't always see happen, normally the third movies are not that good, in some cases are even catastrophic but here Russos bring their directorial power back for a bigger film than CW and thanks to a much more compact and well planned script a much much better film than CW too. Infinity Was doesn't waste any time and goes straight for the jugular from the very beginning.\nThere is no warmup, no normal life sequences that drag on, there is only real tangible threat and the powerless (compared to the villain) heroes that put everything on the line.\nThe film goes on to shock (well depends on what the audience expects form the film) the audience from the very beginning and paints the picture as clearly as possible, the real strength of this film comes in the fact that the story is very much straight to the point, some might even say rushed but the fact is that this \"rushed\" feeling helps in creating those whiplash like moments where the audience is suddenly thrown off course by big moments that are supposed to get emotional responses of all kind from the audience.\nThe sound design is nice and there isn't anything to complain about in that category really and I personally enjoyed the soundtrack too, the character themes come in at perfect places and they are tweaked a little bit to reflect the changes these characters have gone through.\nActing is also very well done in most parts and that should be give considering the names in the movie, however this is the first time that most of these people get to shine in a Marvel movie because normally the scripts are not really on par with the quality of the casts.\nHere as I have mentioned before script shines bright and in turn helps the cast members to be more than what they normally are.\nWhat makes Infinity War really good is that it knows how to balance the tone, the humor is there but kept in check and the closer to the finale we get the fewer out of place jokes there are (altogether there are not many jokes that fall flat and out of place) and that is something that I believe any serious movie watcher would most probably appreciate. I have to say, Marvel and the Russo's did impress me a lot specially after the taste Thor Ragnarok left in my mouth.", "This was worth the wait! Amazing! What else is there to say?!", "What a film both entertaing and funny at the same time.", "Avengers: Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo( who gave us the terrific Civil War and The Winter Soldier), is what we can term as a satisfying summer spectacle. This is not a film. It's an event. In a film with more than 20 superheroes, not once does one feel that any one of them are underutilized.  The plot, as you all know , is about the conquest by Thanos (who is a computer generated character and given a terrific motion capture performance by Josh Brolin), to conquer all the 6 infinity stones and to wipe out half the universe. It's all up to the Avengers along with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop his evil plans.  That's all I can tell u about the plot. Because revealing too much will kill the experience. The director(s) have packed in all they can - marvelous action set pieces, humour, twists and dramatic moments etc.... Almost all the department have done their jobs neatly. Be it the stunning VFX or the exhilarating background score , the film has it all. The climax, I would like to mention, is not at all what you would expect, especially since this is a Marvel movie. Also the character deaths too will come across as a shock. \n \nNow coming to the performances, the list is going to be too long if I mention each and every actor. Everyone has done their roles perfectly and not once do you feel that a single character is given prominence. But a special mention has to be definitely given to Brolin for his outstanding performance. He is a villain that's menacing and heartwarming at the same time.  Hats off for the director(s) for undertaking a project of this magnificience.  So all in all this an experience or should I say THIS IS the Marvel movie we all waited for. So go in and have a Blast. My rating- 4.5/5  P.S: Do not miss the END CREDITS...", "What a surprise! Good intro, ending is so also good! The Part 2 is go to be better!!!", "I don't think somebody who hasn't watched any other marvel movie should watch this. Or somebody who has no idea what is happening in the MCU. For all others, i think this might be one of the best marvel movies of all time.", "Avengers: Infinity War is possibly the best Marvel film yet!\nOut of all the Marvel movies that have been released over the last couple years, there are none as special as their last, Avengers: Infinity War. Infinity War is an intense, action-packed film with every superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe fighting against the mad titan Thanos. Ever since 2012's The Avengers, Thanos has been a potential threat to the universe. The way that Marvel linked this film with the films in the past is also very impressive. All in all, Infinity War is Marvel's number one masterpiece full of dynamic characters with astonishing chemistry, dramatic, thrilling moments left and right, and an emotional storyline that has consistently built up in the franchise. \nOne thing that is instantly noticed are the amount of characters in the film. Almost everyone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in Infinity War. Having all these famous characters like Thor, Thanos, and Iron Man combined into one film is both awesome and breathtaking. Not only do all these characters connect with one another, they also have amazing chemistry. For example, every scene with Tony Stark and Dr. Stephen Strange are both hilarious and intense because both of their personalities are very alike, therefore, creating a clash. Marvel does a very good job grouping these characters, both alike and different, together to make the audience laugh and fall in love with these characters even more. \nMarvel movies are always known for their suspenseful moments of action and heroism. What's nice about Infinity War is that there are so many characters that have their own fight scenes. For example, there is a scene where Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon fight two members of the Black Order, while another has Spider-man, Iron Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy, and Dr. Stephen Strange taking on Thanos. The fact that everyone is fighting to save the universe against only one villain makes it even better. Not only is Thanos one of the most known villains in the Marvel Universe, he is also the most misunderstood villain. \nThanos is a very complicated character to understand. He is always seen as this evil tyrant who wants to wipe out half universe, but, if you really try and look at it from his point of view, you may think otherwise. There is a scene in the film where Thanos and Dr. Stephen Strange are having a conversation. Thanos uses the stone of reality to show Strange that he was born on the planet Titan and how it's corruption led to its demise. He reflects his possible solutions on how he could've saved Titan, but it's genocide. Strange says to Thanos, \"Congratulations, you're a prophet.\" \"I'm a survivor.\" Thanos states. \"Who wants to murder trillions!\" says Strange. Thanos says to Strange, \"With all six stones I can simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist and I call that mercy.\" This shows that in Thanos' eyes, he is doing the universe a favor. He believes that the universe needs to be balanced, even if it comes down to wiping out half the universe with a single snap of his fingers.  Out of all the Marvel movies, this has been the one fans have waited the most for. Marvel is known for having many ending cutscenes that link past films together. The storyline building up to this film is both long, dramatic, and intense. The first film that Thanos is considered a potential threat is 2012's The Avengers. Almost every film after that has a scene of Thanos getting more and more eager to control the universe. For example, in 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos is seen several times throughout the film plotting how he is going to obtain the power stone. The amount of time Marvel has taken to setup this film shows how special it really is. \nOverall, Avengers: Infinity war is a very special and remarkable film. It is full of amazing, action-packed moments, fabulous characters with astonishing chemistry, and has a long, emotional storyline that has consistently built up in the franchise.", "This movie did no fail to astonish and was definitely worth all the hype!", "This movie is one of the best of MCU. VFX are also the best and it have a great plot. It doesn't have dark shade as no of MCU movie has, it contains good jokes. Overall it is full entertainment and worth your time and money.", "Avengers infinity war is the culmination of all what has been built in the past 10 years. Directors had come and told their stories but now it was up to the Russo brothers to put everything together and make all these characters with individual story lines work in a single setting, though that had been done in the previous movies but this film took it to a whole new level. The movie in spite of so many people didn't feel over crowded and everyone got their time in the sun shine. Thanos was an exceptional villain with motivations and goals that made sense. He was powerful, wicked yet had weight in his actions, so great in fact that you think \"Hmm this guy has a point\". Despite Marvel taking a dark route this time they don't shy away from making jokes time to time heck I would say this is the funniest Marvel film yet. I tip my hat to Marvel for making the most funniest and saddest film yet. My gripe about it would be that the Dark order was boring,bland and cliche. Can't wait for what's next!", "Avengers Infinity War seems to be an \"all-star game\" of all Marvel superheroes (well almost) pitted against one villain: Thanos. Great CGI and a well-written script, plus some action and an ending which gave me the temptation of what will happen next via the \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" and Captain Marvel, which will follow up this gem of a movie. May legal and rogue superheroes assemble against the threat from Outer Space. Not only mentioning some originals from Space with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Bring on the sequel... and more Stan Lee cameos (he was in the beginning of the movie... driving Peter \"Spider-Man\" Parker school bus...).", "When I saw this I had expected the death of certain characters because they were leading it up. Josh Brolin does a good job playing Thanos. I'm expecting so much more when part two comes out. Will just love to see Deadpool and Wolverine in the next movie.", "This movie is fantastic. Got me gasping and laughing constantly. Loved every single second of it. Cannot wait to see where this goes onto Avengers 4 and beyond. Absolutely recommend watching this! 5/5!", "Just watch it there are way to many things in this Movie to explain. It had a some flaws the CGI wasn't the best, it was not bad but it could be better. And Thanos henchman didn't had much impact on the story and were in my eyes killed of way too early.\nThe acting was great from nearly every charakter.\nIn the Comics Thanos story is way better explained, ok this would be to much for a single movie. Without that so some times its a bit hard understand why he is doing what he is doing.", "Every superhero cameo brilliantly gave u chills. This movie will make u want to see future marvels movie more bc u want to know what happens next", "Before I begin, I must warn you that I am not a Marvel fan, so my opinion may be a bit \"mediocre,\" while an avid fan would be thrilled with this film. Firstly, I must say that the movie does deliver when it comes to excitement and well choreographed action; unlike the recent 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' and 'Thor: Ragnarok,' where the fighting went on and on and seemed boring and sloppy. The humor is also slightly better than other Marvel films where comedy is \"attempted.\" Also, the gags and one-liners were timed well and did not interfere with drama scenes, as they have before, taking the seriousness out if it. And of course, the most anticipated element of the film was the rumored \"shocking\" finale. The end of the movie was indeed a surprise, which makes it exciting to look forward to the next installment. There are some superheroes that were either underused or did not appear at all, but I imagine that Marvel will work them in next time. Most of the actors gave strong and not-too-hammy performances, and the plot actually made some sort of sense (aka they tried to explain it). The only downsides were the completely unrealistic stunts (but of course we expect and enjoy those in a superhero movie), a few slightly cheesy lines, and a very brief moment of painfully bad CGI. And, I'm sorry, but I'm kinda tired of Stan Lee's inevitable cameos. It was funny the first 20 times, but now it's getting a little old. But that's just me. So all in all, I was impressed with 'Avengers: Infinity War,' I will definitely see Part II, and that's really something coming from me!", "It feels good and also bad it was fantastic but i should be even handed\nif you arent a marvel fan or you dont have much information about universe this film isnt for you and if you are a fan go and have fun ,cry", "Really enjoyed this film thanos was brilliant I actually enjoyed his scenes more then the heros and wasn't expecting that ending.", "I can't wait for the next one and the future of the MCU.", "I was really impressed with how they were able to pull off such a massive undertaking", "Overall, this title earned my review as a critique. Worth my 2hr time.", "Wow...just amazing. I watched it almost after one month of it's release and knowing most of the stories (thanks to the spoilers) but still it was hell of a ride. The balance of acting, action, humor, casting and CGI was absolutely stunning can't blame anything. And the best part of the movie was THANOS. Whenever he appeared on the screen my heart started pounding.  One of the best movie I have ever seen undoubtably. There will be always hater who will try to prove their intelactuality but to me it was all the way fantastic. Thank to Marvel and Disney for giving us 10 years of payoff.", "So so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so sos so so so so Amazing story", "Excellent movie\nBest marvel movie\nWatched it a few times now...\nIf you don't like DC or MARVEL..\nplease do not leave negative comments as your opinions do not matter!", "This is one of the best films in the superhero genre. This will blow your mind!", "Me and my fiance enjoyed every bit of the movie from start that is until the Finish. I guess maybe it would help if I would watch the ending credits as well as I have learned that Marvel has two significant points leading to the next movie. It left me Clueless and wondering but the effects were great jaw dropping impactful and yet job well done. As I tried to be a part of the cast I guess I was just part of the crowd watching as everyone else was left in suspense of what yet is to come I will recommend this movie Down the Line to others who haven't seen anything connected to or related to The Avengers.", "The movie is well sequenced and the characters looked amazing in the movie, the story line is followed accordingly, however the length of the movie may be a little too Long, but overall the movie is really a must watch for marvel lovers", "This movie is awesome! There's not much to say it's just a very enjoyable movie! A couple flaws for sure but the good definitely outweighs the bad", "I've read many reviews on IMDB and generally I've tended to agree with the IMDB rating for a movie, and I agree with this one. Currently it's showing 8.8 which I think is about right.  If you're a Marvel fanboy, you'll love this movie. It is clearly the culmination of a story started waaaay back. Some have said it begins with Iron Man (1) but I don't see that. As soon as we were introduced to the infinity stones we started on a journey towards this film (and the next).  There is light and darkness in this movie (more darkness than light if truth be told). I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but suffice to say I haven't stopped thinking about it since I saw the movie a week or so ago. It's one I'll buy on Blu Ray. I'm in my 50s and for decades my fav movies were Alien and Aliens. The latest movies from Marvel (and Christopher Nolan) come close to toppling their crown.  I wait with bated breath for the finale..hopefully not too long. If you have enjoyed any superhero style movie .. you will enjoy this. Its a sci-fi swashbuckle of an adventure.", "What can I say? Not the best Marvel movie and not the worst, not by a long shot. One thing for sure, this is a heck of a ride. Awesome action, awesome payoffs. I had to watch it twice. The second time I watched it, I wish I had a remote control for the Vision and Scarlet Witch moments - as well as anything to do with the green skin chick who makes you yawn whenever she opens her mouth. But yeah, take all that cr@p out and you are golden. Still a fun ride.", "Where is the \"Infinity War\" review? What is an \"Infinity War\" review? I got one better...WHY is \"Infinity War\" review?.....okay that was a stupid reference. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" gives fans the quality battles and banter they were expecting out of Marvel's biggest comic hero mash-up yet, but also takes things to a new high with a bold ending and providing the best MCU villain to date. Following the breakup of the Avengers, the Earth and the entire universe is finally the target in the crosshairs of an alien war lord named Thanos, who seeks to collect all six infinity stones so that he can gain the power to exterminate half the population of the universe at the snap of a finger...literally. To take on this threat, not only do the Avengers have to get along with each other again, but team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to save the day. But can they? This film is basically review-proof. You can barely talk about anything because just about anything would be considered a spoiler. Thanos plays an Easter egg hunt for 6 glowing power rocks and our heroes, broken into various parties, try to stop him from doing so. The film wastes no time getting to the point and never really has a moment where the film tones down its breakneck pace. Even in dramatic moments the film never drags on too long with any obstacle. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film never feels its length. Character interaction was arguably the highlight of the original \"Avengers\" from 2012 and that is, even more, the case with \"Infinity War\". The new characters added to the Marvel roster are now thrown into the mix and the filmmakers clearly did their homework to make the sure the right individuals were mixed together to maximize the comedic effect. The best example of this is the mix of Thor and the Guardians. If someone back in 2008 would have coined the idea of paring the God of Thunder with a smart mouthing space raccoon (or rabbit if you ask Thor), reasonably the almighty film judges would have thrown the screen booking right at them without hesitation. However, to no one in 2018's surprise the combo works better than one could have dreamed. Then there is the matching of Iron Man (power by science) with Doctor Strange (power by magic). The more Strange appears in films the more I want another Doctor Strange solo film. Except with a good villain next time. Speaking of good villains, that has been a notorious issue with Marvel films. At best, the antagonists are just fine and get the job done, but rarely has there been a villain who steals the show or really proves to be much of a threat. Black Panther more or less yanked the chain along with Guardians 2 and Spiderman: Homecoming. Now comes \"Infinity War\" with Thanos to break the chain. Just in the opening scene alone, the film establishes Thanos as a legitimate threat to our heroes. Not only is he a well presented threat, but he is also a well-defined character. Josh Brolin, who is basically good in everything, provides such a good performance that you almost start to reason with his character's plight...even if genocide is a part of the equation of it all. This really is his film in the end. On the matter of \"ends\", the climax of this film is a new definition of daring not only to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but superhero films in general. I can't say what occurs, but needless to say, it will be interesting to see how they go about following it up. Remember, even though \"Part I\" isn't in the title, this is a two-part story that ends in a cliffhanger. There are no real negatives to speak of here. I personally still put \"Civil War\" as the best of the MCU. I felt that film handled complex social issues and political differences in an interesting way and for me, watching heroes go against each other is more tragic then fighting another common enemy. I also felt the action had more interesting choreography. The battles are well handled in \"Infinity War\"... it is a war film after all...kind of in the title. Still, there wasn't really an \"airport scene\" or \"omg Cap and Iron Man are fighting\" scene. The action is grand, but it's not necessarily one of \"Infinity War's\" highlights in my opinion. Still, it is very impressive when the highlight of a superhero film is the dramatic moments and not the action. \"Infinity War\" provides a quality dosage of both and should be more than enough to keep the core audience healthy and hungry for the next chapter in the MCU.", "First of all, Avengers: Infinity War is unusual story about favorite characters. There are a lot of pain and death. And it's all about superheroes. Secondly, there is absolutely amazing bad guy. Tanos is the person, who has purpose of his life, the idea of saving the world through genocide. When I was watching Avengers, I had realized that understand him. And it is very unusual. For me it was too much locations and characters. Sometimes it looked like huge fast video clip. Wakanda, New York, Edinburgh, another planets and universes are very beautiful, but too much. Main advantage of the story is humor. Doctor Strange, Tony Stark, Peter Quill are main resources of jokes. In conclusion I want to say that Infinity War is a good example of the genre of comics, a film that you need to watch. And of course, we are waiting for the continuation.", "After the first 30 minutes of \"getting the plot down\" the war begins and does not stop for 2 hours. Everyone that matters is in this movie. Many stars with cameo's and bit parts. The way they portrayed the weapon maker Peter Dinklage as Eitri making the Stormbreaker was tops with a scene of Thor's and Eitri's shadows in the cave and the dwarf looking like the giant....There is so much to this movie with many endless plots, but what will blow your mind the most is SPOILER ALERT! .. Thanos wins gets the 5 stones and kills some of the most beloved of all the Marvel hero's by a click of his finger! Dr. Strange, Loki, Starboy, Spidy, and many more. Only Thor, Ironman, that I remember survived, but surely more did. Wheh you will love it.", "This big movie franchise has captivated the attention of audiences world over. Been a fan of the series since the 1st Avengers movie. But was not fan of the 2015 movie Avengers: Age of Ultron as it was a regular charade of fighting of big bad villains. This movie was quite different experience then its prequel. The big cast line up is amazing. Story was bit stretched in certain parts but at normal space mostly. Non-stop back to back plots keeps the interest in the movie. Fate of most characters don't look good but the sequel will reveal the what really happened to them. :P Overall a good action movie for this summer.", "There is plenty to celebrate. Today, releasing its nineteenth movie, the multibillion-dollar American film production company Marvel Studios not only celebrates a decade of glories since the unsuspected inauguration of cinematic universes with \"Iron Man\" by Jon Favreau, time in which, of course, it reaps trillions of dollars for The Walt Disney Company; but also celebrates that its heroes, idealizations of human beings, have become effigies for thousands of kids and grown-ups; celebrates film and comic with passion thanks to remarkable artists who have materialized fictions in the eyes of a humankind in the depths of despair; celebrates life through real feelings packed in gorgeous bags; celebrates it's got an imperishable place in the Popular Culture of the 21st century; celebrates emotional beauty and the complexity of emotions in a shattered viewer who watches; celebrates the endless praises and universal acclaim has obtained with each entry, with every mistake, with every success; celebrates the establishment of a brand that seemed dead in the history of modern cinema- yes, the post-credits scene; -celebrates, at the expense of its interconnected stories, another important establishment in mainstream movies: too many easter-eggs; celebrates the influence that its heroes have caused in the minds of many people; celebrates the start of a grand finale, one more phase, which actually means three phases of triumphs and falls; celebrates that they have built the unimaginable: reaping the fruits of an idea that at first all dismissed - especially production studios, - the fruits that, while represent in monetary gain, also represent a deep-rooted pride of reviving the golden age of comic-film adaptations, building multiverses with more pros than cons where fearless charisma, white humor, feelings, passion, PG-13 ratings and audiovisual high-quality were capital rules in the conception and subsequent production of live-action stories printed in paper; but above all, it celebrates something that is honestly unusual currently: to make cinema, good cinema, human, ambitious, inspiring, diverse cinema with disproportionate amounts as a budget, brilliant. Today, we must wear our most elegant clothes because a long way is coming to an end, a painful, exciting and hopeful end; it won't go away for keeps- never mind - but what we know as Marvel is fading away: marvelous talents, marvelous characters, marvelous messages, marvelous enlightened dreams, marvelous cinema. No one can argue Marvel Studios is its heroic headliners, on this occasion, many flaunt their most peculiar and politically correct personalities. I'm not a fervent comic-factory fanboy, you must win that honor with great effort, I'm simply hypnotized by the magic of cinema, I have followed closely the house of ideas' adaptations for more than three years and, like the fans, I've fallen in love with all its adventures, from the serious-themed ones to the most eccentrically amusing, for that reason, I was afraid of what Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, creators of the script, have conceived, holding in their hands so many options to choose from, hands down, these gentlemen have written a drop-dead gorgeous blockbuster. Always leaning heavily on the comics by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, the most loyal screenwriters of the company get the most out of the mind-bending work weaved by dozens of creative minds over ten years in order to conjure up a praiseworthy ending, made up with the requirements demanded by the buffs but without neglecting the narrative needs of the story, setting up a next-to-last crowd-pleasing thrill-ride of a movie, that reminds a lot of a real Greek tragedy, a hard time. An unspeakable glee emerges when you watch your most loved characters popping up with each new scene, a feeling strengthened by seeing them relating each other, especially those dudes who didn't even know the existence their \"friends from work\" and those who share similar ways of being, where a funny leadership struggle comes up. It can be said that this titanic adventure is narrated by means of three channels, working simultaneously through three different acting ensembles, in order to synchronize the argumentative axis with the superheroe triplet in the end, each of them executing a very important role; it's unbelievable to break down every detail and realize that even the \"least important\" character gets his moment of glory -although, surely, certain men will lose a huge portion of his legion of followers with their actions. Obviously, it doesn't forget the characteristic comedy pack of the company, not always so positive, it breathes the well-known 'Marvel Formula', each hero bathes its own narrative purpose, particularly in the first two acts, with the typical quips, there are many push-lines as comical as dramatic, each one has the chance to shine on screen as they open the way to others, a material in which nothing, absolutely nothing is put at random. Amalgamating more than 70 now-famous familiar characters in a coherent, kinetic and empirical mold is already an arduous task, which is much harder if, like Star Wars' one-billion-dollar flicks, planets and dreamscapes, villains and additional ideas are integrated organized by the screenwriters.  The pictures take advantage of the photogenic faces and the nostalgia coming from each character to place them in the middle of dreamy landscapes which can be scenarios of massacres or simple backgrounds to development scenes. The colors are essential in the scenes, the three groups of superheroes are assigned a different tonality according to the timing handled by every hero; the visual settings expel quality setting spectacular artistic feats, either outside or inside the planet Earth. The set-pieces, that onerous, but risky action sequences are embellished to the max by the excellent, in capital letter, score of Alan Silvestri, with only two not-original songs made for the composer (a couple surprises of yesteryear and Wakanda). The emotional scope of the clamorous and poignant melodies composed by Silvestri is impressive, a potential Oscar 2019 contender for Marvel. If you close your eyes and play the work of the \"Forrest Gump\" composer would emerge the same sensations that if you were contemplating the beautiful pictures, but, what's really beautifully intoxicating is to couple sound and image, making us go through the best, but also through the worst. Trent Opalochy's cinematography and the effort of all creative departments - I'm stunned to see the number of people involved in the production - make it possible that, although the film doesn't become into an instant superhero classic, manages to leave on our minds a good amount of dramatic and action sequences that make history, cinema history, they make your heart beat to the rhythm of the emotion, they make you imagine that you're in the fight, they make you understand why film is life. There's grandiloquence every which way, but here it's not a mere and bombastic accessory, every sequence fits with the script to give verve and impact to every turn the story takes, exhibiting a box of useful angles and camera movements that move away from any superhero-genre clich\u00e9, they are exquisitely built thanks to the truly special high-octane special effects - overlooking every other slip-up.- Any perceptible visual flaw must be forgiven due to the complexity this film encloses; at least in the visual and, therefore, artistic field, it's in the top 3 of the best superhero films in film history, just one more record. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo won't be an expressly idyllic experience for many viewers, what is more, it seems that the mega-event set up by the spoiled brothers of Marvel has switched the game and instead of filling it with nondescript pyrotechnics and visual gags, they morph the accustomed action superhero film into a drama of unthinkable reaches, standing out by the seriousness, coherence, and severity of a script that knows how to use their strengths through characters brimming with soul, personality, and powerful messages. The film veers when it pleases, and although doesn't do it precisely in the best way sometimes, it hits the spot in almost every aspect, causing a really disarming effect, when the credits rolling down, you're still in your seat, speechless, depressed, shocked; no doubt, no superhero film had achieved it to date. Disney's subsidiary company is not jealous of the dark and pessimistic tone of DC, as it has created its own tone with much more deadly consequences than the Warner Bros company's flicks. The first shared universe in cinema history has been manufactured by artists who after long working hours have relegated time with their families to bring happiness to others through adaptations which are etching in our memories. How many kids scamper with Captain America shields in their heads or Iron Man scarlet armors? Ten years of stories as proof of a work full of sacrifices, ups, and downs, But today, after such a long time, the time has come to say thank you, thank you for having transformed present-day cinema, for better or worse. Just like J.J. Abrams' 2015 space opera \"The Force Awakens,\" a new movie-event takes place this year, \"Infinity War,\" the first part of a grim farewell, shakes our senses, its heartbreaking movements deliver a matchless adventure and its strong impact will affect the spectators for much longer, a must-watch. Watching the final scenes is hard task because your eyes are full of tears, that's a faithful sign of what kind of film it is; A motion picture as entertaining as melancholic that shows Marvel's love for his creations and that serves as a very complex turning point leading up to what will mean the closure of a golden superhero century.", "It's awesome to see all Marvel characters together,that's for the rating. But the plot is so long & simple.", "A true Avengers sequel and a must watch for Avengers fans or infact, a fan of any of the other superheroes - \nThor / Captain America / Panther / Guardians / Hulk / Iron Man .. I hope they never stop making these movies !!  GOOD TIMES", "This movie was one that marvel simply outdone themselves and has been one of very few movies that have had its audience attention from the opening scenes all the way to the very end credits. I think I can speak for almost all avengers infinity war fans when I say that the Russo brothers made a masterpiece that was most definitely deserving a round of applause at the end, Within the movie itself having the mission of trying to stop thanos get hold of all infinity stones by making the avengers team with Dr.Stange/Guardians of the galaxy, black panther etc... How it all came together in a way that was magnificent to watch. at the same time and the mixed emotions throughout the entirety of the film is what makes this in my opinion a 5* movie and leaves me wanting more after the most colossal cliff hanger in marvel history. If you haven't seen this movie get to your local cinema and see what all the fuss is about I can very much assure you it will not disappoint", "What a great movie \nFor my opinion this is the best movie in #Theavengers movie series \nIt's so exciting and funny and dramatic\nWell done marvel well done \nI wish dc studios lern how to do good comics movies from marvel", "Great movie! I enjoy every second of this movie. Great directors and great writer.", "Infinity War is a jam packed movie with tons of action and story balanced for a nonstop Marvel experience like never seen before. Infinity War managed to cram a solid story, countless characters meshing together, and fun action all in one film that should have been 4 hours long to fit everything in. Seeing the Guardians finally interact with Avengers characters is one of the most satisfying elements of Infinity War. \nMy only flaw WOULD BE that soooo much is jammed into this film. However, the Russo brothers managed to pull it off as effectively as anyone could. The Jam packed film worked and didn't feel like \"too much\" as much as it would if anyone else had Done a film like this. Loved it, go see this!", "I've never written a review before... But, I felt I should after watching this MASTERPIECE from Marvel!!! Short and Sweet - Movie was a fantastic ride from opening scene to end credits, I kid you not! PACE of this movie was perfect! It does not feel like Marvels longest movie to date.... Go See It In The Theatre While You Still Can!!!", "Avengers: Infinity (2018) This is an American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. It is the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. The story is simple. The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful Infinity Stones. As of May 10, 2018, Avengers: Infinity War has grossed a worldwide total of $1.275 billion. It has received generally favorable reviews. Audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A\". This film has so much going on, it could have been longer or split into two films without degrading the quality. There are some plot issues I question, but I won't go into details and spoil the film. This is definitely is one of the better films of the series. The last three have seen a solid quality boost.", "My friends will like to go watch it again, since they enjoyed it quite a bit.", "It is good movie. My friends enjoyed it a lot and they are willing to go and watch it again.", "Loved it but so many open possibilities for that dang ending", "After the first time I watched Infinity Wars, I left feeling much like everyone else, mind blown at what I just seen. \"What just happened\", I told myself. The good guys lose, evil won. With such a huge cast of lead characters, it's expected that screen time would be limited, but the Russo brothers managed to create a story that utilizes the full potential of each character move the story in a way that don't clutter the screen. Thor is on a mission to forge a new weapon that could slay the Mad Titan, Iron Man, Strange and Spidey team up with the Guardians to fight Thanos on Titan, while Cap and crew try to protect Wakanda and The Vison against Thanos' army. So long story short, Thanos recovers all infinity stones and with the snap of a finger, half of all life in the universe cease to exist. And yes I know this isn't the end of the story, but for such a massive filming event to end on such a somber note, was something else. The second time I watched the film, I seen it in a different light. Although Thanos is a villain to everyone watching, he is very much the centre of the movie. He is in fact the protagonist of the film. I mean, watch the movie from his point of view. Yes he is a genocidal maniac, but to him, his mission is just. This is not a film about The Avengers fighting Thanos and losing, this is a story about Thanos and what he thinks is protecting the future of the universe, and succeeding. The Avengers are just road blocks set up to keep Thanos from carrying out his plan. I've seen many videos of people saying that Thanos is the hero of the Infinity Wars. And although I disagree with Thanos being a hero, to Thanos, he is the hero. But, isn't anyone who wins a war considered a hero to the people fighting that cause. Finally, I want to talk about the character of Thanos in general. Not ever has the MCU experienced such a layered complexed character. Many villains in the MCU can be classified as one dimensional who's only goal is world domination and revenge. Than Thanos emerges from the shadows and gives the MCU exactly what it needs, a complex character who shows emotion. One thing I can say about Thanos is that, he don't seem to do all this for glory or to \"rule the universe\", he simply believes that what he is doing to benefiting the future of all life. Josh Brolins performance gives Thanos so many layers, and should be mentioned in the same conversations as Andy Serkis.", "Excellent movie from start to finish, marvels most bigger masterpiece", "It's a fabulous film.\nIt's not fabulous if you dislike superheroes, but you wouldn't go to watch it in the first place would you so why are you reading this?", "From 2008's Iron Man and a decade in the making. Marvel has built up its cinematic universe essentially crowing itself king of the powerhouse genre that is the superhero movie. Delivering smash hits consistently and improving the tiring formula time and time again. Now comes Marvel's crowning moment. From its small stirrings of after credit scenes alluding to the greater looming threat of Thanos comes the debut of the titan himself in his final push to capture all the infinity stones and achieve ultimate power. It was Thor: Ragnarok that boasted of an end-times prophecy but it is Infinity War that carries all the tone and gravity of that endgame threat. Filled to the brim with the cast of characters we have all invested ourselves into for the last decade, watching intently as Marvel built the innovative cinematic universe to which we find ourselves enthralled with. Returning after a gap of shifting focus to the supporting characters, are the core team of Avengers (except you Hawkeye, sorry) that came together all those years ago. Not only is it delightful to see the team reunite but it's also emotionally gratifying, paying off our investment with the characters, the growth of each of them and the world in which Marvel collectively has built. To some extent, however, Infinity War plays its trump cards close to its chest. It is clear to see who is deemed more important in terms of star value and while the large array of characters are handled remarkably well. Parts of Infinity War feel somewhat cheap, clearly holding restraint in Thanos's malice and makes some moments feel inconsequential even reversible (which it does seem they may do). Although one moment is right out of the comics, what this part fails to do in the film is realise the scope of the malevolent act and instead, the moment can feel like a slap in the face but perhaps that is the desired effect. While it is certainly devastating, future Marvel film plans remove the punch from the moment, revealing Marvel's watering down of this film's scope in order to give further weight to a follow-up. When this should have been more than a set up. At the very least it felt fresh for Marvel. As in the developing nature of this world, Marvel has produced a tiring formula, noticeable in some of the tie-in films but then in some wonderfully flavourful films, there is an attempt to correct that. Unfortunately, Infinity War lacks any real innovation in removing the familiar beats and cinematography of the formula, which for the most part is fine, making a getaway through its smooth execution and engrossing story, even despite the sometimes distracting CGI that there is an over-reliance on. Through the building up of this moment, there is a question of if this is just marketing and generic filmmaking done right. But arguing against that is the reward layered throughout the movie, going a step beyond the general fan service of previous iterations of Marvel movies. Truly giving Infinity War the weight it desires in a threat foretold long ago that is now coming to fruition. It's easy for some to dismiss superhero films as a passing fad of cultural entertainment. But not only is the superhero genre akin to the Western in its prime but so too does Infinity War stand taller than what it is on the surface. Thinking back on the history of blockbuster movies and its beginnings with the magnificence of Jaws. A film that too has had a much more lasting impact than you might have believed in 1975. Avengers: Infinity War feels like this generation's Star Wars moment. There is no denying that Marvel has delivered part of - one of the greatest blockbusters in cinematic history. Which is exactly where the problems lie in Infinity War. This is only a part of the film it should be. Through its telling of the grand story that does a marvellous job of showing us the scope of Thanos's threat, there is certainly a feeling seeped into the film of grand epicness that reminds one of Ben Hur or Lord of The Rings. Much like Lord of The Rings' Shire theme touching on the musical motifs and rewarding us in our investment in Return of the King. When the familiar sound of the Avengers theme swells as the group come together, there is a rewarding drawing of breath like none other. Infinity War is and should be more, originally titled to show that this was, in fact, part one of a story. Infinity War certainly shows that it is, demonstratively pulling its punches. Often seeming downright silly in which it shows that it is merely an emotional set up for the second part to follow. I for one could have quite easily admired this for the marvel that it could have been in a four-hour, even four hours plus film like the epics of old. But sadly that doesn't sit well with general cinema-goers. Ultimately Avengers: Infinity War is part of, the utmost 'event movie' and crowning king of blockbusters. Despite its glaring marketable choice in watering down its grandeur into two separate films and pulling its punches in its most dramatic moments. You'll still laugh, you'll gasp, you'll revel, you might cry and you'll likely finish the entire bag of popcorn without noticing. If part two follows the same tone and weight, improving on the issues with its familiar beats, this will be part one and two of a film for the ages. Nothing short of biblical.", "Best Marvel movie so far. Two and a half hours felt Like 20 minutes, time flew by.", "Another great comic book movie from Marvel. I love every bit of it. Can't wait to see what happens next in Marvel Saga.", "I have been waiting for this very long time and I loved it. I wouldn't say it was the best movie but I found the plot well-thought in general. Here are some ups and downs:\nUps\n Downs\n", "The most well deserved movie I have ever seen. Every character in this movie did awesome... Story line is out-standing. I can't describe it's awesomeness in words.\njust watch it guys...", "This movie had me speechless, emotional and aching for the next one. In all of my 20 years I have never seen such a great movie. It had EVERYHING (and everyone) you'd want in a movie. I had very very VERY high expectations about Infinity War and I can say that my expectations were blown away. It was so much better than I could've ever even imagined. Recommend.", "Haven't watched a movie to this great for a long time. Being there with my daughter plays an crucial important part as it is great to know that she shared the excitement and non stop thrilling of powerful actions.  Above and beyond all the superheroes movies or perhaps any actions movies before with emotional, spirits, cosmic scale of suspense and wonderfully combined with humours, love and team work. Almost 3 hours but does not feel the time at all as this movie stole it. Perfect! Everybody stays until the very end to watch which I never seen before. I am very happy that my 8 years old daughter enjoyed from beginning to end.", "This movie was a very dark movie and there are parts which were distressing. Thanos was just pure evil and showed no remorse. I found the end terrible though. Marvel just single handly scarred a lot of people. Thanos is a god at this point and we don't really get much backstory. In the end he wins by getting all the stones and some of our heroes die then that's that I don't know how they can explain this in the next one. I'm assume Ant Man will go back in time with Captain Marvel. Overall an emotional rollercoaster I enjoyed the Phantom Menace style battle and the Alien reference since Disney bought Fox", "It's a general rule that if you invest more time into something, the more you'll get out of it. This could apply to studying, cooking, maybe a good solid nap, or a good video game. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is no exception. Anyone who knows me even in a casual sense can tell you I'm pretty into Marvel Comics. I can still remember all the way back to the early 90's (all the way back, because, I guess it was a long time ago now) when it was a combination of friend's comics, a few select arcade games, and those awesome trading cards that had character stats on them that first infected me with the Marvel bug. I remember seeing that art and the style, and what the characters represented, and what really blew my mind as a youngling was when I realized that not only were these characters incredible, amazing, and mighty in their own right, but that they knew each other! These guys are a part of a whole universe!! I think that realization was maybe my first time that I experienced a story with an over-arcing lore. Stuff that was read to me by my parents as a kid, The Little Engine that Could, or Peter Cottontail, didn't feature outlandish team ups where everything was on the line (not that I'd necessarily be opposed to Clifford the Big Red Dog and The Berenstein Bears teaming up to knock the stuffing out of evil aliens). \nI think one of the rewarding parts of a whole universe like Marvel, and their contemporaries, is the sense of reward that the fans feel when they see characters that have their own self-contained franchise and world meet each other and work together. To someone outside of the know, it just looks like a band of superheroes, big deal, right? But to fans, you're seeing characters that have their own harrowed origins, unique powers and motivations, supporting casts, and mythology interact with other characters who are their equals, their peers, and have all of those same elements as well. When you center that kind of team-up around very, very high stakes, like the fate of an entire city, or maybe the world, or possibly, even further, all of the universe and known reality, the excitement and scale of the fictional world that these characters inhabit takes on a whole other level of importance and depth. \nBut how do you communicate something like that in a movie, where you have a limited amount of screen time, actors with restrictive schedules, and budgets to balance? I'm sure that for most of film history, something like the Marvel Universe, in its scale and entirety, was considered something strictly for printed, comic book material. You can see in past comic book films that studios that owned the rights to a whole universe of characters never had them meet, never thought of their headliner superheroes meeting each other, and how that would operate. In the past 10 years, Marvel Studios, in conjunction with a few other distributors until they could finance, film, and distribute movies on their own, has become a giant in the entertainment industry, and it's all because of that same idea and concept that drew me to this world when I was in kintergarden. The right minds at Marvel Studios realized that bigger picture, the overall story, was what mattered, and that if it could be communicated properly, would be something that would change superhero storytelling on screen forever. \nWe thought that everything had changed back when Avengers first came out in 2012, after about 5 and 1/2 years of build up, and that with the follow ups, things had changed even more, but I can definitively tell you that after Infinity War, there's truly no going back. There's often a lot of talk that the superhero genre is going to burst like a bubble at some point, like Westerns and the macho-action films of the 80's and 90's, which is still possible, but fans of the genre and characters should be grateful that Infinity War has been released before that point. After the great reception and revitalization that the well received Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther movies generated, Marvel couldn't have timed this latest entry any better. \nWith this being the 19th overall entry into the series, Infinity War keeps the energy alive in the saga by addressing some of the criticisms that often gets levelled at the MCU by impatient critics and people who might not be as familiar with the overall story: that the stakes aren't high enough, the villains aren't threatening and compelling enough, and that there aren't any consequences for the main characters, that they're insulated and protected to keep the franchise going. One of my main concerns about the MCU since the first Avengers, is that since there's so many moving parts in the saga, how would Thanos be handled and introduced? In the 6 years since he first appeared post-credits, we haven't seen a whole lot of action and development from him as a character. He's a looming background presence, and despite being teased and established in a very basic, general way, we haven't really seen much from him, despite having the opportunity. I'm relieved to be able to say that any worry I had about his authenticity is gone. Thanos is one of the most dynamic, ruthless, yet also fascinating villains in the series and for all of comic book movies yet. Josh Brolin's matter-of-fact and stoic delivery, occasionally dipping into a few surprisingly heartfelt moments, really ties the movie together. The CGI on Thanos captured his expressions, overwhelming power, and menace very well, he blended right in with the cast for me. One could almost say that Infinity War was really about the journey and development of Thanos as a character, and that The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Wakandan tribe are really just obstacles for him that he needs to get past, to accomplish a goal that while sounding insane and vicious, has justification from his point of view. The movie does a great job of taking a character who could so easily be a cardboard cut-out of a villain, evil and cruel just for the sake and fun of it, and makes him into a guy that, yes, while definitely all of that, has a reason for doing what he's doing. It doesn't have to make rational sense, but that his motivations are present and well-illustrated in a few scenes makes him dynamic. Despite how flawed and disgusting they are, even the worst despots from their point of view have some kind of reason for doing what they do, and delivering on that aspect was crucial, and makes Thanos a very engaging villain for us to watch. I now understand that the early movies set the stage for who you thought was going to be a madman of great strength but little character, and then surprised you with a bit more depth once he finally made his anticipated entrance.\nI can see why the Russo Brothers were chosen to direct this entry, Joss Whedon brought the team together skillfully in the first installment, but I think his peppy dialouge and lingering on petty conflicts, while perfect for the very first time the team has to work as one, wouldn't have worked for a conflict and story on this scale. The Russo Brothers balanced those inter-personal relationships with a huge, multi-faceted story in Civil War, and were brought back to do the same on a level 10 times bigger than before. (Side note: way to rep for Ohio, boys!!!)I won't talk a whole lot about what I thought of each individual character and actor's performance of them, or the action scenes, the powerful emotional moments, or affects, which are all more or less completely spectacular. Infinity War is long, and this only part 1, and there's just too much to address in this review about all of those topics, this would become a long, long essay. Just know that the huge multitude of relationships are handled well as long as you the viewer know these characters, understand how they fit together, and are able to keep track of what their importance to the overall plot is. I'd be interested in the take of a first-time viewer, who watched the end result of a decade of cinematic storytelling, and wonder if they thought it was worthwhile or not. I can certainly tell you that this experience is mainly for those who've invested the same time and energy into this saga that the creators themselves have, and are arriving at this journey after all this time. \nIt's tough for me to view Infinity War as a stand-alone movie, to judge it completely on its own merits, because in my opinion I think that's wrong. I think that's unfair to the design of the story itself, and while I know that there are critics and people out there that will do this (which they're completely valid in doing), it's tough for me to, but I'll try. I do think that it bounces around a lot and the pace can be fast sometimes, but shouldn't it get a pass for this? It has to cram so much into its nearly 3 hour runtime, and even that was split from it being 6 hours with the second part (if anyone from the studio is watching, I would gladly, gladly watch a cinematic re-release of the full cut with intermissions peppered in like they did back in the day). The fast pace and character juggling in a standalone movie without context would be terrible if this were our first time getting to know these characters, but it's not, this movie is a collection of multiple threads that have been established for years, with its own over-arcing narrative thrown in as well. So while I'll take just a few points off for some scenes that I think could've breathed more, or times where I think it brushed past something a bit quickly, again, take that with a grain of salt, because those criticisms come from trying to look at I.F. as its own movie, when really it's a summary of what came before, and I would posit that looking at the movie that way would be the viewer simply digesting the material wrong. I give everyone at Marvel Studios a huge hand for making something for the fans.", "They nail a huge project while balancing the limitations of \n1. Staying consistent with the characters personalities\n2. Portraying emotional depth and interaction\n3. Hit all marks on witty and fun banter when it comes to the interactions of the cast\n4. Building a believable antagonist, that is justifiable in his motivations.\n5. Giving just enough screen time to all the major players without getting away from the over arching end goal.\n6. Choosing the right heroes they do have to fill in the original missing roster of the comics.  They really did their best with the decision making in how they wished to portray the movie. Die hard comic book fans will either appreciate their decision making in some areas that struggle or lack an unexplained narrative. and this is where the Russo brothers show their creativity, but not without fault.  Based on the fact they don't own some of their original franchise, there will be major holes in the plot. They're missing a few key players in Silver Surfer, Adam Warlock, and even X-men. So prominent heroes like the hulk and vision end up taking the minor roles.  There are a few glaring inconsistencies in the portrayal of power which take away from the buildup of previous movies. While they paint a great experience, they shoot themselves in the foot when attempting to portray a balance of power in a fantasy scenario. The first being that, in one scene they show Dr. Strange having the capability of dismembering a limb with his abilities, (foreshadowing how it could be used) but then doesn't use it in the most opportune moments that would otherwise end the narrative. unnecessarily writing yourselves into a corner. The attempts at filling these plot holes with scenes of Dr. Strange saying he's seen every possibility and there is only 1, isn't compelling enough to patch the plot hole. This is something that i feel needs to be paid more attention to especially in fantasy power franchises when attempting to stay consistent with the logic of the super natural universe. You either show the hero attempt it and show it's futile or you don't show his abilities having the capability at all. It cheapens the worth of Thanos and especially the experience that he is an absolute threat. As viewers we put ourselves into the position of the heroes, and what we would do with the powers given it's limitation and scenario, and i find that this is one of the more simple scenarios they could have easily addressed and taken the option off the table. We enjoy seeing wit and thought in these battles, and when it's simply a battle royale that attempts to stop thanos from balling his fist, it looks very weak story wise even with great CG and Actors.", "I gave this movie a 7/10 because black panther is a new movie how did he die in the same year WTF??? Even spider man died and all of the people in guardians of the galaxy died how is there a new movie for both characters??? MIND BLOWING Right!!!!!", "I can't wait to see this again. Marvel has truly outdone itself this time. It's amazing how they tied so many hero's together for one movie. No spoilers here but I just left speechless! This movie is great for all ages!", "Absolutelty wondeful. The critic score seems too low, im notmsure as to what they sont like about tje move", "No doubt I'll score this blockbuster a 9. The intensive fightings have a good rhythm and a logic without big bug. Thanos attacks each battlefield one by one and give you a good impression how it happens till the end-- though kind of vague in it. But it is exactly what the directors want-- wait for the next one!", "It has all been leading up to this moment... And when the moment appeared, it did not disappoint- at all. The latest edition in the Marvel canon, Avengers: Infinity War really had to do a lot to please fans because so much was riding on the hope that the movie would be successful. For starters, it would be the film that celebrated the MCU's 10th birthday (the MCU's first film, Iron Man, came out in 2008). It would also probably be the biggest crossover film ever. Bringing together every character that the MCU has ever had (except Hawkeye and Ant-Man for some reason). And it would also be the goodbye film to some of the MCU's veteran actors. It could've also easily flopped like last year's Justice League (I saw that too, it wasn't very good) by getting caught up within all of its character backstories. But it didn't. In fact, it was an amazing movie. Not as good as Black Panther, but almost. For starters, the story is very good. It's opening scene is great and pretty surprising. It doesn't waste any time introducing the main villain and getting caught up in all of the backstories. The story also isn't afraid to kill off certain characters and the ending is just an excellent cliffhanger. The story is near-perfect! Also, the characters are excellent! They are realistic and oh so badass. Not to mention very well-created and fleshed-out. And you will probably find yourself rooting for your favorite hero in the end. There is also some well-placed humor to help lighten the mode (such as \"Oh, were using our made-up names now. Okay then, my name is Spider-Man). One villain also gets roasted so badly. The performances are also great: Every actor seems to be performing to the max. The only bad part about this movie is that maybe the ending is a little too cliffhanger and that both Ant-Man and Hawkeye are left out. Other than that, everything is great. The character development is great, the action sequences are great, the mood is great, the twists are great, the moral is great, and the special effects are obviously great. Above all, this movie is another win for the MCU, a perfect way to celebrate the 10 year birthday for the franchise, and a total masterpiece that lives up to the hype! And surprises us still.", "Everything built up to this perfect end just right in every way. This whole duology should actually be 8 hours long (kidding...or am I?). Such magnificence and excellence in filmmaking should get every comic lovers full appreciation. Thank you Marvel, but as I promised my final rating will be after watching the final part, I have faith.", "For literally a decade I've been frustrated by the inconsistency and plotless attempts of the MCU movies, but specifically the two Avengers films. There have certainly been huge hits for me (Dr. Strange, Iron Man 1, Guardians of the Galaxy 1) and some major misses (Thor:Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Iron Man 2 and 3). But I've never liked the first two installments of the Avengers films. However, this time they finally got it right. Infinity War is everything every avengers movie set out to be and everything the first two didn't have. A compelling plot, character development, real dialogue (With none of the forced humor that ruined GotG 2, Ragnarok and Black Panther thank God). And an actual compelling ending that legitimately makes me unable to contain my excitement for the next one! Something no Avengers film has done this far. Well done, well done, well done.", "After 10 years of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, it's great to see that Disney and Marvel have still yet to give a truly terrible addition to the universe - with a huge ensemble cast which is balanced beautifully - you will laugh, cry and remain on the edge of your seats from the Marvel Studios logo to end-credit scene, which I seriously suggest waiting for! If you like the 'superhero' genre, you will love the 19th entry into the MCU.", "Avengers: Infinity War was a wholly enjoyable experience which presents the MCU at its peak. I was certainly surprised at how well balanced the film was considering how many characters they crammed in and how many different sub-plots were going on. The tone was mostly consistent, with the serious moments thankfully not being undermined too much by humour, but the humour that was there worked pretty well. Also Thanos was a great villain who actually felt intimidating and a real threat to any of the superheroes he came up against. The way his character was constructed meant that you understood his motivations for why he wanted to wipe out half the universe. The section of the narrative that looks at his relationship with Gamora was also very effective, providing an intriguing backstory to both their characters. However, what made this film for me was the presence of actual stakes and consequences which previous MCU films severely lacked. Heimdall and Loki are killed off within the first 5 minutes which sets the tone for the very bleak ending in which half the universe fades away after Thanos gathers all the Infinity stones and clicks his fingers. I really appreciated this. I do have some minor gripes such as the beginning of the narrative being rather clunky and some dialogue being quite poor but these don't outweigh the many positives of the film. Also the ending makes me very excited for the next part as I don't really have any idea of where they go from here. The post-credits scene of Nick Fury messaging Captain Marvel suggets that she will have an important part to play in the sequel so I'll look forward to that immensely.", "Life is usually a fight, not always physical and definitely not always to the death. People, by enlarge, work hard to make things better. They do it for themselves, their family, employees and sometimes co-workers. We go to the movies to feel... Some look to feel scared, some to feel good and others to just think. We don't go there to feel like losers. To the people that own the creation of Avengers - Infinity War, you took our heroes that motivate us to stay in the fight and do more... Do more than most of us are capable and you made them losers? Shame on you...", "Awome Movie Its 2018 Top Hit List Confirmed.\n Its Having Very Marvelous View", "After a few minutes done, i am freeze a second, likee pfoooooof. whatt thee... is it the ending??!! tbc huh; for iw.", "Infinity War! The massive outcome of 10 years!\nWorth it? Absolutely yes. Thanos, the progression of the story, technical details etc. Well done, Russo bros. (and of course our remarkable Avengers<3) The only part I complain about is that Wakanda-Battle. How come the glorious Wakanda Army don't have a cannon or something can be called as 'big gun'? That part was really disappointing. \n I loved the movie and give 8/10 (but i'm afraid of DC fans so I decided, giving 9 on IMDb is a better idea)", "I am just speechless. I thought it would be great movie but I can not expect that much. This movie have made with lots of super hero. In the previous Marvel movies we saw different movie have different category, like funny, action, brave, talent or sad ending movies. In this movie we found every thing. And this movie's script is out of this world. It is really good. And also there are many mysterious things, for that we need to wait for the next Infinite War movie.", "I think this movie is going to be the best movie until avengers 4, honestly exceeds my expectations and open doors for more theories and questions", "Can't believe that I cried to superheroes movies, one of the greatest movie of all time so farrr", "I'm not going to bother keeping spoiler-free because it would prevent me from talking about what I liked about this movie. Well, I think we all knew that we were going to see what could be the biggest movie ever this weekend. Typically, scale and high stakes in a movie doesn't impress me that much, but this brought scale to a new level. For one thing, it was the first time that a Marvel movie really had consequences. I suppose Civil War had real impacts at the end with the Avengers breaking up, but this was the first time that characters actually died and the bad guy won. I expected characters to die, but I did not expect Thanos to achieve his goal and certainly didn't expect so many characters to die. Even as Thanos will killed off half the characters, each one was kind of shocking, because so many of the characters in this movie are ones that to this point have been protected by plot armor. For those of you who don't know what that means, many of the characters that died seemed too important to kill off. I'm definitely interested to see where they'll go with the next big movie. Thanos has achieved his goal, so there's no real threat to be expected from him. There were a few minor things that I had problems with. One was the continued overuse of one-liners and quips in so many scenes. Some of them are legitimately funny, but they're kind of annoying. One of the people I saw it with afterward was like \"it seemed like they crammed one-liners in wherever they could in bad moments\". I agree with this, but there is something to be said for the way that the light-hearted tone of all the other movies and even the majority of this one made the ending of this movie so much more striking. Of course, it does seem like there's a way to bring all of the characters back later, but it was still a powerful moment. The other little issue that I had was that there were a couple points in the fight scenes where the heroes seemed like they didn't pull out their biggest and best moves until it was too late. Typically, you see this more with villains not seeming to fight quite as well when they face down the hero, but it just seems like they could have stopped Thanos at a couple points if they'd used their figurative (and literal) bigger guns earlier. It felt a little convenient, but I didn't mind so much because it was going so much against what Marvel usually does. Otherwise it could maybe have done better with pacing, but I couldn't say how. There was so much packed into this movie that I can't really fault the writers in any regard because they just had so much to work with. They certainly get the plot started from the start and keep it going at a breakneck speed throughout. The fight scenes are not the very best I've seen, but they are pretty good and definitely engaging to watch. It's not on the same level as Kingsman or the newest Mad Max, and honestly I think the original Avengers may even have a leg up on this sequel in terms of actual action sequences. However, this movie definitely delivers dramatically charged action scenes with a lot going on in them. You have to see at least half of the MCU movies up to this point if you want to see this with any kind of comprehension. I'd seen 10 out of 18 with a basic knowledge of all the movies I hadn't seen going into Infinity War. If you want an above average MCU movie that doesn't require tons of background, I suggest Black Panther. If you're already caught up and reading a spoiler-full review, you've probably already seen it or don't need encouragement to see it anyway. As I write this, the movie currently sits in the 10 spot on the top 250. I doubt it will stay, and I don't think almost anyone would say that it's actually tenth best movie ever and it definitely won't stay that high, but it is definitely a special movie that's like nothing you've ever seen even from Marvel. Honestly, I don't think there should be a bigger scale movie than this one, except for maybe Avengers 4, but it is good. I'll be a bit surprised if it doesn't pass Avatar as the biggest movie ever, but I won't be helping it there beyond my one ticket. It may not be a work of art per se, but it is undeniably a landmark of cinema. Overall Rating: 8/10.", "Speechless. This movie will blow you away. The ups the downs the comedy is mixed together so well", "Awesome movie. Lacks an interesting soundtrack but really fun. Now on the important things : Bring Loki back pretty please and thank you.", "There are a great many reviews out there for this film, so I thought it would be relevant to say this for those who are fans of the Marvel Universe series who are planning to see this movie: I am guessing you will probably not like, maybe not get and probably ruin your enjoyment of this franchise if you have gaps in your Marvel movie watching. If you have seen most of them but have missed the last four movies before this, for instance - it won't be the same at all. Do yourself a favour if you are invested in this franchise.\nI know that sounds dubious as if I were a paid shill, but be real: Marvel do not need anyone's advertisement at this point. I say this mainly because, seeing as friends and family are going out to see this in groups and have missed recent movies, they will not get the most from Infinity War. I have seen the film twice already, and the more people I know who are going out to see it with films missing, the more I feel bad that they will not get the best experience. If you have never seen a Marvel movie, I would not bother. In essence it would be like watching The Empire Strikes Back without first having seen Star Wars: A New Hope, or watching the last season of Game of Thrones without having seen the previous seasons. It would just make no sense and ruin all that could be.\nIf you haven't seen some of the recent movies like Guardians of The Galaxy vol2, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man:Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther, do yourself a favour and borrow them from a friend, take the time to enjoy them; then watch this. I think it would be pointless otherwise.\nThe movie is going to be out for a while so I feel there is plenty of time to catch up. I saw it in IMAX 3D, which was amazing, and then again in Real3D, which was also unexpectedly amazing. The IMAX showing gave this big film the big experience the film deserved though. Just thought I had to put this message out there. No point having a ten year story arc ruined for no good reason at all.  Also, there are some pretty heavy scenes which I don't think would be good for very young kids who won't understand what is going on. I think my Nephew would probably be traumatised, he is only 6. Plus the film is very long, 2 hours and 30 minutes. He would not hold out that long without needing to go for a break, so if he does end up coming with us to see it we will need seats near the exit for breaks. Perhaps being a bit shocked might be good for kids nowadays. Star Wars certainly was shocking for me when I was little, and that only made the experience better. I really enjoyed this movie thinking I would be possibly disappointed, having bought and read the original comics back in the early 90's  I will probably be seeing this more than 10 times! Wishing all a great time at the movies this Summer  Excelsior!", "Wow! If you already enjoy this genre of movie and have invested the time to watch most of the previous Marvel movies leading up to this and you can handle hard endings - then maybe, like me, this will become one of the best movies you've ever seen. Fantastic.", "There's a bit of everything in this movie. Went to see it twice. It's great. Don't miss the post credit scene", "There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they can make the universe that nobody else would, to see if it can be more than a franchise. On that day, when Hollywood's most brilliant filmmakers came together to win box offices the way no one could. On that day, they made the MCU. All theatrics aside, this is an achievement unlike anything seen before. For ten years, we have had the pleasure of a consistently good series of films starring superheroes, many of whom were virtually unheard of or overlooked by the general public from \"Iron Man\" to \"Black Panther\". Now, the hype has reached its highest point yet when the Avengers and others must band together one more time against their greatest challenge yet, the mad titan Thanos, who seeks ultimate power by collecting the Infinity Stones, which power a Gauntlet that will allow its user total mastery of the universe. Words may not be sufficient for what I experienced, but I'll do my best nonetheless (without spoilers of course). Seeing all the faces we've come to know and love come together, in some cases meeting for the first time, and playing off each other was beyond amazing, their chemistry practically flawless and well worth the wait. They also provide beautiful combos of skills and powers to the table with even minor characters like Nebula and Falcon having their moments to shine on the battlefield. The music perfectly accentuates many scenes from the epic to the tragic like Capt. America's first appearance and the comedy is top notch. Plot twists are at an all-time high here as there are many things that utterly shocked me to the core, one of which made my jaw drop. In fact, the drama is arguably as strong, if not stronger, than the action scenes with plenty of heart-wrenching moments and dialogue. So, after all the buildup, how does Thanos hold up? Enough to hold up the very heavens. Josh Brolin brings an astonishing depth to a menacing villain who is almost the protagonist in this story, his backstory and motivations making complete sense when you think about it. You also empathize with what he's going through as he is not going on his campaign unscathed, physically and emotionally. He's not doing it out of a clich\u00e9d bad guy desire but out of sense of what he believes is right (different from his comic counterpart but still effective).  It's funny how these movies played out as a trilogy, not just literally but in a state of being; the 1st had the spectacle in seeing these heroes come together (body), the 2nd was more philosophical (mind), and the 3rd hits you in the heart (spirit). The film ends on an open, ambiguous note, so we'll have to wait for the 4th Avengers to complete the story. Some of you should have spare underwear and be ready to empty your tear ducts for the awesomeness and tragedy to come. The tides of the MCU have changed and we must be ready for anything.", "Best of the 3 Avengers movies. It will be hard to beat and I am eagerly awaiting next years' movie", "The ending wasn't really that great,the cliffhanger with Everyone disappearing due to Thanos's infinity stones is really not my taste.", "Mixed feelings about this. You just can't end a movie like this. No hope. That's cruelty.", "I'd waited years for this film, perhaps that's why I felt a bit let down. Over all the acting was great, and the action better, but with dozens of characters struggling for screen time, the movie was rused and hurried from one scene to the next. The space scenes were excellent, but the plot back on Earth involving the Earth bound heroes could have been handled much better. Perhaps when the second half of this story comes out, I'll change my tune, but I enjoyed the previous two Avengers films much more.", "Juggling a wide array of characters from 18 different movies, across a 10 year span, Avengers: Infintiy War delivers on all cilindars. Marvel has once again taken a seemingly impossible task, and proved they can handle anything thrown their way. Each character gets their chance to shine during the runtime, and although there can be clashing tones, the movie never loses its audience. For a common movie fan who hasn't followed the marvel movies, you may be lost. The movie contains no character development, and it doesn't have to, as we've been developing these characters for 10 years. It's fun to see characters you known thrown into situations and forced to interact. This movie is a great time, and any fan of the marvel movie will be happy with it. I don't anyone needs a recommendation, as you already know if you will be seeing it.", "The only thing I would like to say is that DC should learn how to make movies from Marvel Directors. Couldn't take my eyes off from the screen even for a second. Just amazing!", "The best avengers so far and i like what Marvel studio did with thanos a real badass", "Really good movie especially if you know what's happening. People are devastated about the deaths but everyone who vanished from the \"snap\" will come back. They are already planning the sequel to Spider-Man Homecoming and Black Panther so there is no doubt in my mind they will come back.", "First of all before my review of the film, I think we all need to say a huge thanks to Marvel Studios/Kevin Feige for the last 10 years of hugely entertaining films that they have gave to the whole world, if your a fan or not, what Marvel Studios has achieved will likely never be replicated or done again by any other film studio and you have to congratulate them on their huge success, so thank you Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige for releasing in my view, the most fun, most entertaining movies anyone will ever watch in their entire lives. I personally think Marvel Studios could bring out a movie about a garden fence or a broom and it would still be a box office hit and be the most entertaining thing you'll ever watch. Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige simply have a Midas touch, everything they do literally does turn to gold, albeit box-office gold, long may they dominate and be as successful as possible. This was always going to be a hugely ambitious project, squeezing every major character into this movie from the first 10 years of films was always going to be a difficult thing to do, but I believe they did fantastic in giving each character screen time, others have more screen time such as Thor, Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Thanos, I would have liked to have seen more of Captain America, Black Panther and Scarlet Witch but I realise not every character could have as equal screen time as other characters simply because characters like Doctor Strange etc are more key to the films plot/story. You do have to wonder if maybe some minor characters were needed or not, as there are a few who really have no lines such as Black Widow, Bucky, Falcon and some others, it did feel as though these characters are there just for the sake of it of it although in theory they didn't need to be. But kudos to the Russo Brothers for managing to give each character their own part to play. I think the run time was just about right clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, this never dragged as there was so much going on and it really does keep you glued to your seat not knowing what is coming next. Thanos, I do confess I had a feeling that Thanos wasn't going to be portrayed the right way, I actually thought that he would be just a similar villain just like Loki and other weaker villains in the MCU. But this is the Russo Brothers we are talking about, no way were they going to get Thanos wrong. In the first opening scene you will fear him in an instant as he takes out The Hulk, literally decimates him, from this moment the audience know that Thanos isn't one you wan't to mess with and you will know that the Avengers etc are going to have to do something remarkable to defeat him. This is a villain who wants to wipe out half of humanity and you will clearly understand his motivations for doing so, maybe the world needs a Thanos as currently with the world population in real life getting bigger and bigger each year, there might be a time when we all can't live on this earth, back to my review and not politics/climate change lol. Anyway, Thanos is done close to perfection, the CGI does not look out of place once and you would think it is Josh Brolin in a suit or costume, he looks that real, speaking of which, Josh Brolin absolutely nails the part, the voice, emotion and for looking menacing, perfectly cast again from Marvel Studios, you will simply wan't to see much more of Thanos, unfortunately in next years Part 2/Avengers 4 he will obviously be defeated which is a shame. Even Thanos collecting all Infinity Stones is done perfectly, I won't spoil for anyone who is yet to watch the film but what he does with some of the Infinity Stones is great to see. There is so much action in this film, one of the best battles is when Iron Man, Star Lord, Drax, Mantis, Spiderman and Doctor Strange are battling Thanos and the Avengers actually look as though they have defeated him by removing the Infinity Gauntlet which has all the Infinity Stones on, this is a stand out scene as you have a team up seen for the first time, it is great seeing the Guardians interact with Stark, Doctor Strange interacting with Spiderman, for me the best one had to be Thor meeting the Guardians on their ship, Star Lord getting a bit jealous of Thor's muscles. Another highlight is the clash of egos between Strange and Stark, all new team ups are done perfectly also and fingers crossed in next part we will see more. Action scenes are thrilling, especially when battling Thanos. The end was a bit of a strange one for me, and for many others and it won't be to everyone's liking, again I don't spoil for anyone yet to see this, but it is probably not the best ending as everyone knows it will be reversed in the next part. I guess it is a slight criticism of Marvel Studios in that they announce their schedule for the next five years or so, so you know who will survive and who will be brought back via the Time Stone. Other than the ending and not much screen time for fan favourites such as Cap, Black Widow, Hulk and others, there isn't much more to fault about the film, I did leave the cinema thinking where was that epic battle scene? whereas they are more in small doses rather than on a large Lord of the Rings scale, there is a battle in Wakanda but the action cuts away from there some times to another battle, it was best to cut to different battles as all groups are in different places during the movie, it would have been hard to have all the Avengers, Guardians etc in the same place and have that epic Avengers moment with all the characters standing side by side.  I think every actor is great in this, Chris Hemsworth literally can do anything, laugh out loud one minute then crying the next due to losing pretty much everyone, Downey Jr is great again and delves into sadness and in fear of what potentially bad things are going to happen, Chris Pratt is just as funny as Hemsworth and you see the chemistry between the two actors, Benedict Cumberbatch gives a fine performance as always as Strange, everything from his accent to the look of that character is done to a tea and with ease, Josh Brolin is perfect, hard to imagine that is Brand from The Goonies, Brolin has created a villain you can sympathise with, feel for and someone you fear, the voice he gave him is done to perfection, all the cast are great, and I really do believe that no other actors can play these roles. I really do hope that Evans, Hemsworth, Downey Jr, Ruffalo etc continue to play these roles, perfectly cast and I can't imagine the Avengers being played by anyone else. If you are thinking of giving this one a miss DON'T, because of the characters, action galore, team ups, the villain, the infinity stones, characters get killed off, the comedy and lastly for the stakes which are big, Infinity war has it all and then some. I will go and watch it for a 2nd time and maybe a 3rd because it is a cinematic event ten years in the making, and lives up to the hype. Here's to next April when we get the real end with Part 2. Congratulations to the Russo Brothers for making another phenomenal film, congratulations to the cast also for playing their roles perfectly. and lastly congratulations to Marvel Studios for 10 years of truly great great films, here's to another 10, hopefully the Marvel Cinematic Universe don't change too much after next April, with a plethora of characters they can introduce and what with the characters they already have, hopefully Marvel Studios can continue to be even more successful. Forget there being any kind of Superhero fatigue, Infinity War is currently breaking every record imaginable and looks set to be the highest grossing movie of all time, and that's only in it's opening weekend, simply phenomenal. To all the superhero haters, these amazing/great/immensely entertaining films are here to stay. Takes these Marvel Studios and DC/Warner Bros movies away and the Hollywood box office would suffer in a big way.", "One of my favourite Marvel films, Thanos is just the best villain, bring on Avengers 4", "The end of this movie gives new meaning to the phrase \"done and dusted\", though I can't explain that without a spoiler! No doubt at all, you get your money's worth. Infinity War pulls you right in, there's never a dull moment, and it's every fan's dream to see this many heroes all at once. I'd say the strongest part of this one is just how well all of them are managed. Still -- I'm going to hold back giving this a numerical rating for IMdB till I see Avengers 4 next year. (Note added a year later: I've seen Avengers Endgame now, and I rate them both 8/10. Endgame is splashier, but Infinity War has a more tightly constructed storyline that is handled masterfully.) It's not giving anything away to say that these two movies are a duology (or actually a duology with a prelude, which is Thor Ragnarok: the action bridges seamlessly from that one to AIW.) Some things happened in TR that I wasn't fond of, but they turn out to be resolved anew in AIW. It sets up some big new problems though, so how effective AIW turns out to be will depend on how well they bring it home in A4. People who want to judge this one harshly -- just wait. This is only the first half of a bigger story. I've got my own ideas about how it's going to shake down but there are already a bunch of \"theories\" being floated out there on the Web. OK: in short, this one raises the bar yet again for the genre. Marvel has a smoothly running machine that knows how to turn out a well crafted product; and I have to give their writers and planners credit for thinking way ahead -- concocting plot arcs that unfold over several films. Full credit as well for giving us a fantasy world so absorbing that you kind of have to shake yourself back to reality when the credits finally roll. I felt the same sort of way with the Lord of the Rings trilogy (the original three, not the Hobbit trilogy). Each of those three films was about 3 hours long, complex, layered, and interlocked. Is AIW at the LOTR level? No. The LOTR films were a bloody miracle. But the new Avengers is darn good. After the terrific success of Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther in just the past few months -- along with CA Civil War (2016), which was functionally Avengers 2.5 -- it wasn't clear what they could do to top all of that. And maybe if AIW turned out to be \"just as good\", it could still be counted as a win. But it's better. The CGI is state of the art, the jumps between the multiple plot lines are expertly timed, and since almost all the characters are already familiar they don't need backstory time. After the first 20 minutes of so of dramatic entrances, you can just settle in and watch them go. The characters that do need introducing are the villains -- Thanos himself, who isn't actually in every scene but somehow feels like he is, and his powerful Black Order minions. Thanos has plenty of time onscreen to develop his backstory and goals, but the four Black Order chiefs are given zero backstory, essentially there to give several of our heroes something to fight. And about the heroes -- it was great to see Dr. Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Gamora being given the screen time and status they deserve. Some others may have been shortchanged, though that might mean they'll have bigger roles in A4. Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olson, Josh Brolin are superb actors, Tom Holland is good and getting better, and all the rest of the cast are more than competent. And for me the surprise of the whole film was Peter Dinklage's role, which takes the way he's shown in his other movies and delightfully stands it on its head. However, in this kind of movie the best actors won't be used to their full potential anyway, because the story itself is the main thing and they are all there primarily to keep it moving. Brolin does nicely at raising Thanos from a one-dimensional character to 2-dimensional (can't really expect anything more in superhero movies) as someone with a past and with strong reasons for his actions. He's an evil man doing the good that good cannot do (If I recall right that quote is from a Mickey Spillane novel); it's just that his idea of \"good\" involves erasing half the living beings in the universe. Two other little complaints: the words 'galaxy' and 'universe' are used interchangeably (which is like comparing a grain of sand to the whole Earth). And there's a certain CGI effect repeatedly used toward the end that is directly borrowed from X-Men The Last Stand. All in all, it's great stuff. I'd go and see Avengers 4 right now if it was available.", "Has a great plot, and was very emotionally involved. If you've like the past Marvel movies, you'll love this one.", "What a great movie. It is one of the best superheroes movies that has ever been made. All of the characters did an awesome job in their role. Definitely going to buy when it comes out in DVD. All I can say is go see it and enjoy! You will not be disappointed!", "I was totally speechless at the end of the movie. The entire cast were at the top of their game in this film. The action scenes were obviously fantastic, the CGI on Josh Brolin was perfect, the special effects were amazing, and the movie included over 60 characters!!! This movie was off the charts! I can't wait for part two to come already. Everyone needs to see this movie!!!!", "One of the best marvel movie ever made after iron man 1st and the avenger 1st this movie really outstanding iron man in this movie really awesome.", "Jokes 10/10, Action 10/10, CGI 9.8/10, Story 10/10, Marvel 10 Anniversary", "Like most people I went in expecting it to be good, and serviceably handle the number of characters that had to be balanced. I didn't expect it to do I in such a consummate, thrilling, emotional, funny and powerful way. There have been high water marks in different ways before in the MCU - Thor Ragnarok (comedy), Civil War (ensemble), Guardians 1 (left field-ness), but this raises the bar in every way.", "First thing to be said, you'll leave the theater with a feeling of disappointment. How on Earth can the Avengers lose the Infinity War? Because that's exactly what happens at the end. That ultimate villain named Thanos sit and looks at the horizon thinking \"well, it's done, I finally made it\" while half of the Universe (and half of our heroes) lie dead. Not possible. That's not superheroes movies are meant to be.\nOnce that feeling washes off, you'll realize you just watched a great superheroes movie. It has all the action you expected for, amazing visual effects, a great soundtrack, and probably the best performances of every actor involved in a Marvel movie. The plot is not trivial but dense and deep, there's an incredible amount of characters but they work perfectly fine together, and you get really attached with some of them. Even with the villain: I heard more than a few persons saying about Thanos' motivations \"well, maybe he has a point on that...\".\nI talked about performances. Josh Brolin is superb. Despite playing a CGI character, he manages to turn it into an acting masterclass. Three of the superheroines shines high too: Zoe Saldana (the best in my opinion), Elizabeth Olsen and Scarlett Johansson. Chris Hemsworth plays the best Thor I've seen. Of course the Sherlocks Duo, Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch, are both magnificent. Chris Pratt, Don Cheadle, Tom Hiddleston, Dave Bautista, all of them are very well too. Bradley Cooper makes a better Rocket on every movie.\nDislikes? A few. I still don't get the idea about Groot. I'd be a little frustrated if were Vin Diesel and all I can do is say \"I am Groot\" a few times per movie. And I really don't undestand why Marvel has turned The Hulk into a comic relief. We saw Bill Bixby in the '70s series, we saw Eric Bana and Edward Norton in the first Marvel movies, and we saw Mark Ruffalo in the first two Avengers movies, all playing a complex character, struggling with his inside beast despite being superior scientists, and I still don't believe that those pitiful jokes are coming from Bruce Banner. At least, if he makes a joke, I'd like to laugh.\nAnyway, it's really a good movie, undoubtly the best one from Marvel since \"Captain America: Civil War\". It's not unlikely that I go to the cinema to watch it again. I really enjoyed it. And if you saw it and you're still in pain because all of that dead superheroes, remember the last phrase on the screen: \"Thanos will return\". Someone has to be there to stop him, that's for sure.", "Well as per the my point of view this is the one of the magnificent, humdinger film and production. I am more interested to know what will happen next in second part.", "Hands down the best marvel movie I have ever seen!", "Long story short...one of the best avengers movies yet. Amazing action, hilarious dialogue between characters, and a bold ending that will no doubt leave you shocked. Deep and powerful emotions throughout. Really impressive CGI and crazy fight scenes. Definitely exceeded my expectations. Go see it.", "A gigantic, monumental film in every aspect, with epic battles, absurd development and spectacular villains, \"Avengers - Endless War\" is not only characterized as the best film of Marvel, the film also presages to be one of the best hero movies already made, and the only reason for not being such, is that in the end, we little believe what we see, because we know, that the situation will be reversed in the second, after all, it's a hero movie. The script that tells the story of Thanos, a kind of man who intends to give mercy to the world killing half of its population, thus ending, with the shortage, Thanos is a hero of absurd development, and beats head-on with Nolan's joker, as being the best villain in the movie of heroes, putting different universes and countless heroes in the same universe, the directors are successful in embedding several stories, not always with a perfect rhythm or the perfect excuse for, but, it does not get boring, nor gets to leave one or the other too much to corner, which is a merit grade. The cruelest thing about the film is that we understand that Thanos wants to end half of the universe, the character does not think of it as genocide, but an act of mercy to the suffering of people, and we can not support it, but we understand its actions, Thanos is not a sovereign and robotic villain, he is human, perhaps and strangely, the most human of the film, and watching coldly, perhaps the hero of the film, this characterization of Thanos and the development of it, is simply brilliant and magnificent. Technically the film is a show of special effects, and directing action scenes, great choreographies and frames, and cleverly putting battles in separate areas, not creating a big mess in a single center with all the heroes, even so, sometimes it seems that something came out in the editing, the transition in many moments is completely inorganic, just like your photo revesa and changes according to the core on screen, although this is not necessarily bad, it's just a touch of visual marking, well adjusted soundtrack, jokes in the right moments and well-balanced drama, Avengers infinite war is a well directed and finished film. The cast is fine, nothing too spectacular, even because no one has a lot of screen space, but they all play their role well, with a small highlight for Robert Downey Jr and Tom Holland, in isolation, \"\" Avengers - Infinite War \"is a spectacular movie , with small problems, it's true, but still spectacular, which does not give him a soul of genius and unique, is that we know that his story will continue, and everything shown so far will change, intrinsically, this disrupts our experience with this but nevertheless, contemplate the best film of Marvel.", "First thing first: Marvel has hit a bull eye with it's post ten year celebration with this movie. There is absolutely no dispute about the fact that Infinity War is the most anticipated movie ever in the comicbook history so far but it is compelling to know that it is completely worth the hype. The movie had everything which a CB fan is looking forward to. From perking actions to tear causing dramas this latest installment in the Marvel series is a treat to watch. The only irky part about the movie is that it rushes to end quickly after a steady start, but when you have to pickup 22 superheroes' storyline that is what you should expect first.\nGo to the theatre and have fun but take tissue along with you too.", "Drama, action, comedy & imminent danger; Visual FX & CGI are beautiful; it has great landscapes that put you in the movie; photography is pretty good; camera in hand is also immersive & gets you into conflict; it has a lot of humor, more that Marvel's previous ones (except Thor Ragnarok), also, this humor is too good, you laugh all the time with the interactions of the characters & it's set to relax from the tension & drama; the film handles the emotional aspect well in moments, i didn't feel anything in others, since they want to make you cry by repeating the same situations from previous movies in MCU; Doctor Strange has a lot of power, as well as Thor; Thor & Rocket Raccoon have good chemistry; Thanos is the best villain of MCU, terrifying & imposing, main protagonist; best film since The Winter Soldier; the Black Order is good, although inconsistent, have great powers & fight well, but when they face someone with low level, it turns out that they win them for the convenience of the script, terrible & meaningless; it feels like a 5-hour movie, but split into 2; waiting the next year for the second part.", "Entry number 19 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), all roads have been leading to Infinity War since a Thanos-teasing end credits stinger in 2012's The Avengers (and more broadly since Iron Man kicked it all off in 2008). With Thanos (Brolin) the biggest and baddest threat Earth's mightiest heroes have had to face - and many of the franchise's original stars at the finishing line of lucrative multi-film contracts - the stakes are higher than ever. Even the most popular MCU icons are in life-threatening danger this time around. In the unenviable position of juggling over 20 established characters in a satisfying manner, whilst also delivering the high-end action expected from this series, directors Joe and Anthony Russo get a lot right. Two and a half hours allows for a plethora of mammoth set pieces and the Russos don't hold back. The choreography isn't the most stylish (nor the CGI as polished as it should be), but every dollar of the considerable budget is utilised to craft wall-to-wall action. An exciting first-act sequence teaming up Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), Iron Man (Downey Jr), Spider-Man (Holland) and Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) quickly sets the all-or-nothing tone, but also demonstrates just how difficult the balancing act will be across the lengthy runtime. Whilst Iron Man gets an electrifying entrance (arguably the best moment of the whole movie), Strange never gets to show off his coolest trick, use of the mirror dimension. And where Spidey gets a suit upgrade, Banner gets underwhelming assistance from the Hulk. These trade-offs are littered throughout, with some more egregious (Clint?) than others; however, the narrative pace is so lightning fast that a few character absences or minimisations become more of a concern after the credits have rolled. Where the filmmaking brothers really strike gold is in the barb-heavy dealings between our favourite heroes. Thor (Hemsworth) and Star-Lord (Pratt) are hilarious in their one-upmanship, Strange and Iron Man build a bromance through witty insults, and Black Widow (Johansson), Scarlett Witch (Olsen) and Okoye (Gurira) combine for one scene that tantalises the oft-rumoured all-female Avenger flick. It is a shame though, that whilst Thanos is given the time and dedication to be fleshed out as one of the better villains of the series, his four hench-creatures are visually bland and narratively unnecessary, their design and execution reminiscent of Steppenwolf in Justice League. Although it doesn't break through into the very top echelon of MCU outings, it's not far off either; a few sneaky cameos, consistently delightful character interactions and one of the franchise's best climaxes ensures Infinity War is an immense crowd-pleaser.", "The event is finally here, and boy does it have big expectations to live up to as the culmination of ten years of movies comes rushing in. With perhaps one of the biggest expectations to meet, can Avengers: Infinity War meet everything we die-hard fans love, or does the over expectation syndrome come into play. Robbie K with a spoiler free review coming at you to shed some light on the subject.  Movie: \nMarvel: Avengers Infinity War\nDirectors:\n Anthony Russo, Joe Russo\nWriters:\n Christopher Markus (screenplay by), Stephen McFeely\nStars:\n Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo \nLIKES:  Character Development: It's always nice to see character evolve and while the 18 installments before this movie have laid strong foundations, Infinity continues that trend. Not everyone gets the full red-carpet treatment (with all the characters at hand), but those that do have some deeper trenches we did not expect. You'll certainly feel things resonate if you've been following the story so far and a fantastic means to tie you into the story.  Story Twists: We all have theories about this movie, most centered on who would survive the war for the Infinity Stones. Despite everything foreshadowed in the trailers, you have no idea what is coming. Infinity Wars is a universe filled with twists, throwing in suspenseful moments with ease and doing everything to keep you on the edge of your seat. The trailers were certainly edited to leave out key details, and that mystery was very well appreciated as the revelations began to drop and the story began to click, up until the very end. Be ready for some answers to lingering questions you may not have realized you have, and some surprises that will have you cheering in delight and excitement.  Acting: A small quality to comment on, and way too many actors to hit up in detail, the acting still lives up to the potential we had set up. All the contenders easily reprise their roles, bringing delight, fun, heroism and heart wrenching moments to life with no hesitation. Mixing the team together, really did feel like an awkward, weird family trying to save the galaxy one minute at a time. Despite all the characters crammed into this mega hit, the chemistry works fantastically.  Comedy: Marvel's writing continues to lean towards the comedic stick, trying to garnish the comic plots in a more expansive way to net more audience members in the box office. Infinity War has plenty of moments mashed into the space epic adventure, a mixture of slapstick, insults, well-timed cursing, and comical references that keep the giggles, guffaws, and laughter coming. Don't worry of the darker atmosphere overshadowing the laughs, there will be plenty to try and keep things as bright as possible.  Action, somewhat: The special effects are hands down impressive, especially seeing the stones powers better utilized than just exploding like previous films. All the sound editing and CGI are worthy of the theater spectacle, perhaps the biggest reason to come see in the theater. Infinity War has some decent brawls that deliver the fist pumping, adrenaline rush you wanted to see as new tricks are unleashed and styles mix together. Especially near the end, there is one particular fight that feels much like an epic video game battle with all the bells and whistles ringing into one. A little eccentric at times, but hey it is a comic book movie.  \nDISLIKES:  Lulls in Action: While there is good storytelling in this movie, an Avengers movie is known more for the fast pace and battles. There are some major lulls in the action, as the three-story trails attempt to connect all the pieces in the quest for uncovering the stones. These gaps are by far entertaining, but at times I felt another battle needed to be integrated, or others extended to keep the pace going. I liked the emotional warfare in this movie, but come on, a little more resistance.  The Black Order: This is only a semi-dislike, but Thanos elite guards were not as \"elite\" as I had expected. Gross and creepy looking, definitely. Deadly and threatening in design? Absolutely. But in regards to their skills, these masters of destruction were kind of... weak and under developed. It doesn't mean they don't get their 15 minutes to shine, but let's just say these characters really needed more integration in the story for this reviewer to enjoy.  Too Many Characters?: So many people mixed into one movie, brings with it the threat of potentially denying your favorite character the time you want him/her to hold. It happens in this movie, so take what you can get and run with it as best as you can. They do a nice job with most of them, but three of the characters got a bit stiff armed that I wasn't expecting to see. So, this element could have been tweaked to get a better immersive story in my opinion.  The Ending: I can't say much about this, but the ending to Infinity War is almost as mixed as the characters in this galactic quest. There will be many questions generated from it and even more theories as to how the next wave will proceed, which I guess is good to keep interest coming. However, it kind of felt cheaply delivered and rushed over, in a manner that was sort of a cop out to be honest. Based on that last sentence, this component is why the ending was not as well-received, not for the questions it generated.  The Fight at Wakanda: The biggest selling point of the trailers was that war on the Wakandan plains, where Wakanda soldiers join the elite squad to fight thousands of CGI aliens. With all the storytelling elements building up to the climax, I had very high hopes this battle was going to be the climactic piece to bring it all together. I'll admit, there are some parts that are true creative genius, but much of the battle was glazed over, dull, and missing so much of the battle chemistry I had expected. Quick finishes to semi-suspenseful moments, and much shorter than I anticipated, this battle was certainly the element I was most disappointed with.  The VERDICT:  Infinity Wars didn't quite live up to the hype that the marketing brought with it, but this does not mean it was a bad movie. A very edgy tale awaits the theaters, with twists and character development waiting to evolve our characters to the next level, with a few flashy battles to liven things up and comedy to ease the tension. Yet, this project may have been a little too big to tackle, leading to many things being glazed over in trade for others. Try to lower your expectations and I think you will be okay, just try to accept that there will be answers to come, one just has to wait.  My scores are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.5\nMovie Overall: 8.0", "I enjoyed every minute of this film while it was happening. It was so thrilling, so action-packed, there wasn't time to look for flaws, or to chat, or to simply say to your friend \"Wow did you see that?!\", it was brilliantly done in regards to pace, aesthetics, timing, all was great. For an action superhero film it absolutely delivered, money well spent, poor DC, etc After the film finished, after the tube ride home, the thing that was kind of pressing at the back of my head just burst into my brain and made me feel that even though this was a majestic film, true modern mythology, it still didn't manage to escape the expected traps: a) By packing a movie with so many characters, we only managed to see developed story-lines for some precious few of them. Also, because there was so much plot going on, the story didn't actually develop much. I think we had about 15 minutes of story in a 2,5 hour film. Which means there wasn't much character development as well. Because of that, if you are not an MCU fan, this movie will mean nothing to you. Our collective emotional heartstrings as an audience were pulled in regards to the characters simply because we know these people from previous movies, if we didn't we wouldn't have cared about them at all. b) All movies who decide to play around with the subject of Time, need to tread carefully. This movie not only decided to bring alternate realities and time travel into the game, it did so casually. This will obviously be used as a storytelling tool, which is not necessarily a mistake (it depends on how it will be handled), but it is a cheap trick (e.g. having Scarlett Witch destroy the last stone only for having Thanos go back in time and get it), I know Marvel is swimming in money right now so they don't care about this stuff, I'm just putting it out there, because it's true, and it's a fact that will be heavily criticized. c) They practically created a villain who is a master of all the elements of the universe. You can't really fight that, it doesn't make any sense. Of course nobody cares because the fight scenes are majestic and everyone is too busy holding on to their arm rests for dear life, again, I'm just saying that now Thanos actually has it all. If you're an MCU fan, this was what you've been waiting for. If you're not, you'll have fun, but you won't get much of a kick out of it.", "REVIEW - AVENGERS INFINITY WAR Possibly the most anticipated film of the year finally hits the big screen but is it really that big?  Big cast \nBig special effects \nBig action \nBig villain \nBig silence  The problem with the marvel universe is that they announce films far too early.  Let me try to explain.  Imagine that a hero gets killed off but you already know their sequel is being made and is due out next year. Would their death have as much of an impact?  Yes if you don't know their sequel was being made but confusing if you did.  I can't and as usual won't give too much away but all I will say is there are 2 scenes that are pivotal to the part 2. One involving Dr Strange and the 14 million and 6 possible outcomes and the party involving Starlord slipping Thanos. I would guess that these 2 scenes set up part 2 out next year.  Story easy to follow.  Can be confusing figuring out who all of the characters are especially as Captain America is now not in his Red White and Blue uniform / costume.  There is a lot to see and it is worth doing so on the large screen but I didn't leave feeling blown away and I honestly can't figure out why?  Rating 8 out of 10", "The movie is just brilliant, to me it is the best marvel movie yet. Marvel seem to impress me every time.", "Very good but....Will only get a full review when I see how they finish the story. No closure for me in pt1, sadly", "This movie includes every single marvel character so far even the guardians.  There was a lot of build up for this one movie considering Thanos is the final boss in this game. As someone that went into this movie blind I was 100% sure that there was no way Marvel could deliver.  I stand correct.  Beautifully shot, whimsical effects and well written their isn't a dull moment in the entire run time. I think Marvel heard the common complain about the villains being forgettable and death not mattering in the MCU... they said \"Here, hold my beer!\"  Thanos is so well developed that he puts loki to shame. The guardians (and Thor) still managed to steal the show but with such a large cast of heroes it's understandable that some will shine brighter.  I would recommend watching this in a full theater, maybe sneak in a few teens and kids and watch their reactions to the last act. We are so sure the heroes and popular characters are safe in movies and it's the side or new characters that are on shaky grounds that emotions were running high by the end. If you've watched any of the marvel movies then this is a must for you!", "From the word go this did not disappoint, action from the start and full of different things to keep your eyes glued to the screen. \nSPOILER if you didn't already know there is a part 2 so don't think your getting a big ended it lines it self up well for part too: \nWill see this again I'm sure of it", "I had great expectations for this movie, and it delivered plus more. Its 2.5 hour with action, humor, interesting dialog and all your favorite marvel characters. Ok, some very few are missing, but all the big \"players\" are involved. By far the best superhero movie of all time. Delivers on so many levels. The new thing about Marvel movies is that they have put in a lot of humor in it. Like the last Thor movie and Guardians movies. Avangers IW are kind of like that but the punchlines makes you crack out laughing. Feel like this is a mix of everything that is good about all the individual films. 2.5 hour was not enough. I want more.", "Its an amazig movie, The plot is just out of the world. The fight scenes make you stay still for all the parts of the movie. \nYou should go to your nearest cinema and buy a ticket, because its the cinematographic event of the year.", "Attempting a sequence of artful spoiler manoeuvres, I am going to endeavour to deliver a review of 2018's biggest film, while avoiding marring Avengers: Infinity War for the vast crowds who I'm sure will besiege cinemas this weekend. With this in mind, I'll probably tend towards the fairly condensed version, and keep it brief.  Avengers: Infinity War is the exciting culmination of an entire decade of cape-toting, witty-minded heroes who work at just about the coolest gig imaginable - operating as a super-powered team that's the perfect amalgamation of soldiers, gods and billionares under the law enforcement/counter-terrorist organisation aptly named S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division). Throw the roguish Guardians of the Galaxy and a few newer Marvel Cinematic Universe additions into the mix, and you have a ginormous, well-accrued force that'll bash any opponent black and blue before you can say, \"Mr. Tony Stark\". Well, that's the hope. But rising at last to the challenge, the great arch-villain of the Marvel universe finally rises to the (age-old?) challenge to subjugate Earth's Mightiest Heroes in a global domination that will forever shift the reality of the Marvel universe. Avengers: Infinity War follows on from its numerous predecessors as a very worthy finale (or part one thereof). It delivers on comedy (if the Guardians of the Galaxy are involved, I guess that's just part of the parcel), drama (we see new emotional depths in this film that I think Marvel is desperately in need of) and a whole bunch of extensive battle sequences, pitting together a range of enemies (an interesting experiment in abilities). The movie does a good job of juggling several dozen characters, and gives everyone a special role. I'm intrigued by how the movies have shown the progression of each character throughout a long period of time, and how they have naturally changed.  There are \"stunned silence\" moments, \"laugh out loud\" moments, and a couple of \"eureka!\" moments. Some questions are answered with satisfying results; some are left shrouded in secrecy for a grand reveal next year. Thanos makes the ultimate villain, filling those special (size 69?!) shoes with pride and unwavering cohesion, joining the ranks of such other great villains as Davy Jones from the Pirates of the Carribean. He really makes the movie, in my opinion, and I'm so glad to see so much of him, and to realise that he's a solid character with depth. He is indeed, the ultimate villain of the Marvel universe.  The music is a bit sub-par, although the couple of times that the Avengers theme breaks through is really strong, musically and emotionally. I was amazed, watching this movie and thinking of the mind-numbing 3-4 hundred million spent on this blockbuster of blockbusters, so to speak. There must be tens of thousands of effects in a movie like this. I can't wait to see what monster opening it conjures up. I'm excited for part two, as Infinity War does very much beg a sequel - and not a sequel in a year or so - right now! This movie will have the whole fanbase in an uproar (a more favourable uproar than The Last Jedi caused, I presume), and for a reason.  One trouble I have with the film is simply that everyone is so overpowered. I know it's sort of necessary and certainly expected, but something I can't stand in modern cinema, is the idea that any character can be brought back from the dead. That isn't how real life works. If a character dies and I expect him/her to return soon enough, I'm hardly going to actually mourn his/her death. I can't say for certain, but I have a suspicion that Marvel MIGHT do that... and I'm going to stop there, because I don't want to spoil the movie. Enjoy - it's one crazy ride.", "Let's start with the scale: it's big. Te scope is unlike any. Thanos is a fantastic and memorable villain and he is soon to become an iconic villain. The humor is well balanced with the dramatic scenes and when this movie gets dark, it doesn't shy away of being really grim and even scary. The stakes feel real. You never feel like anyone is safe when Thanos is on screen. Unlike the airport battle, every battle makes it seem like it might be the end of the Avengers. It also ditches the typical structural formula Marvel likes to use and it's a pretty different experience thanks to it. The action is very clear and well choreographed and i can not imagine this being directed by any other director other than the Russo brothers. The CGI is really detailed and brings things to life. There are huge and beautiful cosmic landscapes to be enjoyed here. The obly aspect of the CGI that felt \"off\" was the Black Order's CGI, except for Ebony's. Can not recomend it enough.", "People complain about lack of screen time and dialogue for certain characters but what do you expect in a 2 hours plus movie? (Where is Ant-Man?) Though I agree this is more to Thanos movie instead of the heroes. You get to understand why Thanos act like that. His intention is good but what he believes is wrong. I heard Thanos will get his own movie? Anyhow hope part 2 of Infinity War that will feature another superhero will have a satisfying ending. I will certainly watch it in cinema again.", "This movie is big with so much going on. I applaud the directors and everyone involved in making this movie. Im no movie maker myself but i can only imagine how difficult a task this was to bring so many characters together and make it work but somehow they did. Heaps of action, drama and comedy and a villain that surprised me. \nFinally, the humour and chemistry between characters was great and Drax! For me, Drax again was the funniest!\nStay tuned for the after credits......its pretty cool!", "That's all I can say. This movie could have gone so incredibly wrong with all it's potential to fulfill, but it goes so incredibly right. The shifts in tonal voice and feel, the balance between the superheroes and their abilities, the choreography of the fight scenes, the smooth dialogues, the humor, the emotions - it could not have been done better. I'm baffled by how they were able to pull this off. The only thing that could have lifted the experience for me was if Ebony Maw (black order) was voiced by Bill Nighy - but that's just sugar coating the cherry on top.", "Everything Disney did wrong with Star Wars the Last Jedi, they did right with Infinity War. It's the Empire Strikes Back of the MCU. The current situation will be a great start for Avengers 4.", "The best movie ever. So much action and the first time that a bad guy won. I cant wait for part 2. But i guess, in the last scene of guardian of the galaxy high priestess create something i asume that is ADAM WARLOCK who is going to beat Thanos. But anyway this is the best movie ever!!!!!", "You should just watch the movies. do not watch or read too many spoiler. the best superhero movie ever.", "If you don't like superhero's or the Marvel stay home, But if you lived the story through the previous 10 years, you are going to Enjoy this! It's a rollercoasterride with big fights epic moments and great Humor! Loved it from start to end! Can't wait for part 4", "AVENGERS #infinitywar felt like Marvel just dunking all over DC: Genuinely funny jokes that felt effortless, real emotional stakes & payoffs from a decade of world building and character development, crisp, inventive action sequences and an ending that left my jaw on the floor.", "This movie is what every superheroes fan needed,it is spectacular how they mash up every single mcu movie for this moment,this Infinity war.", "Everything was really unexpected \nfun and sadness \nand we are waiting for the next movie \ni cannot describe how it was \nand i hope the next movie could be better", "10 years of Marvel cinematic universe coming together for an ambitious and exhilarating biopic - welcome to Avengers: Infinity War. In similarity with the brilliant storyline execution present in Game of Thrones, Avengers: Infinity War effortlessly ties in multiple character storylines to show the rush to save the universe from Thanos and his quest for 'balance'. A whole lot of laughter and tears later, I found myself on the edge of my seat, counting down the days until we see what happens next!  Overall, Avengers: Infinity War lived up to my high expectations on all accounts - all except one! In such a blockbuster masterpiece that has A-lister and A-lister and spared no expense in doing so, it seemed a little bittersweet to not have Hugo Weaving return as the voice of Red Skull. Just a minor detail in what is easily now my favourite Marvel film.", "Thoroughly enjoyed it and it was made even better by not being too predictable.", "Great blockbuster movie, one of the most entertaining cinema experiences of my life. Not sure if it's the finest marvel film but it's certainly the grandest. Excellent performances from the whole cast as well!", "I am not the most ardent proponent of the Infinity Gauntlet miniseries (I prefer The Life and Death of Captain Marvel, Thanos Quest and Warlock by the same Jim Starlin), but this has nothing of it. An industrially-made crapfest akin to MacDonald Hamburgers with bored-to-death actors easily repleceable with robots from a car factory. Avoid.", "Great way to set up the end I hope Endgame is three and a half hours long", "It's increasingly difficult to review MCU films independently of one another; past films inform our expectations, and future films fuel our speculation, to a degree that a capstone movie like this one is so fraught w/ concerns for how it fits the larger story that its individual worth is almost impossible to assess. That said, it did an excellent job of making the ending we should all have been expecting still hit hard emotionally. Also worthwhile were some welcome new players, and the entire Ni\u00f0avellir subplot (complete w/ Beta Ray Bill Easter egg).", "Quite honestly, there isn't much to add in a review that hasn't been said multiple times already, so I'll say this: I am not, nor have I even been a comic book guy. Even at 45, I've never had an interest. That means that I have no major understanding or connection to the Marvel characters and universerse beyond what the movies feed me. Thankfully, my 16 year old son doesn't get tired of telling me the backstory on certain characters, places, or origins if I want more information on specifics in any of the movies. This particular film had a lot going on, as there were so many different groups of super heroes on various pieces of the quest. Not that I couldn't follow it, but it was definitely more than a typical Marvel flick. Overall, this was just a pretty darn incredible flick. The writing was good, the acting was no different than I've come to expect in a Marvel flick, the direction was good, the sound was superb, the fx were absolutely MARVELous, and the production was simply out of this world. Those facets combined made for a great viewing experience. When I saw the duration of nearly 2 1/2 hours I was a little turned off, but after the first 45 minutes, the need for such a lengthy film was obvious, and by the time it finished it certainly hadn't felt like 2 1/2 hours. That's a good thing! Though I must admit...seeing all these Super Heroes die made me wonder what Marvel has up their sleeve, as they can't just kill off a bunch of dudes (and dudettes) who pay the bills for the studio. My son's theory is that they are trapped - or being kept- in the soul stone, but I think it will have more to do with the time stone. Either way, with the next one hitting theatres in 2019, we should find out soon. Very enjoyable, action packed eye candy of a movie.", "Don't understand why but this is the first movie which gave me goosebumps multiple times", "Rian Johnson, Shane Black, Warner Brothers, take notes! In a day and age where films such as Iron Man 3, Justice League and Star Wars: The Last Jedi subvert audience expectations to infuriating results, Avengers: Infinity War does it in a way that actually works. Returning behind the camera for IW are The Russo Brothers who previously helmed the last two Captain America films for Disney/Marvel from a screenplay written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who also wrote all three films in the Captain America trilogy and who were writers for the first two Chronicles of Narnia films. The plot follows the Mad Titan Thanos (played by Josh Brolin) in his attempt to find all six Infinity Stones and bring balance to the universe. Though the Avengers have split up months after the Accords situation, they must sacrifice all in an attempt to stop Thanos by teaming up with allies, old and new. At first, it might look like too much to Cram all of these 50+ characters (yes, even the Stan Lee cameo) into one movie, but in all fairness, it's all been building up to this since the first Iron Man movie. And I'm pleased to say that it definitely lives up to expectations and like I said before, subvert those expectations in a way that doesn't alienate audiences. Whereas Iron Man 3's idea of subverting expectations is doing a live-action rehash of The Incredibles while at the same wasting the acting talents of Sir Ben Kingsley, Infinity War's version of it is a Marvel sequel influenced by films like Wrath of Khan, Empire Strikes Back, Aliens and even Apocalypse Now while telling a different story at the same time. Whereas The Last Jedi's idea of subverting expectations is a pointless side quest to Casino Royale, Infinity War's version is a side quest to meet a giant Peter Dinklage (YESSS!!) who actually does something that moves the plot. And whereas Justice League's idea of subverting expectations is 2 hours of Superman's CG Homer Simpson mouth and PS3 quality graphics topped off with a forgettable score from the always talented Danny Elfman, Infinity War's version is two and a half hours of amazing visual effects and impressive CGI work on Thanos and to top it all off,a beautiful orchestral score by Academy Award nominated composer Alan Silvestri who composed the scores to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers (2012) and whose known for his collaborators with Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future trilogy, Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump & Contact) and Stephen Sommers (Mummy Returns & Van Helsing) and who also worked on films such as Predator 1 & 2, The Abyss & Ready Player One. But obviously the highlight of the film is obviously Josh Brolin as Thanos in what might be his best preformence in all of his career (tied with No Country For Old Men). The moment he is on screen from the cold open to the very end before the credits roll, I was impressed with Brolin's preformence, even considering the fact that Thanos is a character that could only be created through VFX,I felt like I was watching a preformence instead of another generic CGI baddie and I really sympathized with his motivations.And he's definitely the best villain the MCU has introduced thus far. All in all, it might be the most divisive film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the most divisive film of 2018, but it did live up to my own expectations and therefore it instantly became my favorite film of the MCU and my favorite film of 2018 overnight. I was completely silent by the film's final moments when I saw it in theaters on my first viewing and I'm still impressed with the film after multiple viewings. Also, stick around for the credits! 4/4 Stars (A+)", "In this film, Thanos was the most fascinating and also the most complex personality of the story.", "Review:\nThis is definitely the best film of 2018! After watching it 4 times, and still seeing new elements to the complex storyline, I can honestly say that this is the best Marvel movie to date, and I can't wait to see Avengers: Endgame later this year. The action scenes, especially towards the end, are amazing and the magnificent cast all put in great performances. Although the superheroes were under so much pressure to stop the evil Thanos, I still found the witty scenes quite funny, and the CGI was totally on point. The emotional ending, and touching Gamora storyline was a great addition to this spectacular film, which has left the public questioning what will happen next. The director did a good job by not making the plot overcomplicated, even though most of the Marvel Universe were involved, but I would have liked to have seen the Hulk, who was brilliant in Ragnarok. Anyway, this movie sees the evil Thanos, killing everyone who gets in his way to get the 6 Infinity stones, which will give him the ultimate power to bring balance to the Universe. He believes that the universe will soon collapse because of the overpopulation of the intelligent species. He in his insane way had developed a possible solution to this problem: reduce the population by half so that the existing pressure on the resources will automatically reduce. He doesn't strive to eliminate the life form, rather he aims for wiping half of them randomly so that he can create a balance between intelligent life form and resources. To achieve his goal he needs 6 stones in his gauntlet, which include the Space stone, held by Loki, the Mind Stone, which is in Vision, the Reality Stone, which was given to the collector, The Power Stone, which is on Xander with the Nova Corp, The Time Stone which is held by Dr. Strange and the Soul Stone which is in Vormir held by the Red Skull. The superheroes from the Marvel Universe gather to stop Thanos causing mass destruction, but the more stones he gathers is the more power he gains. That's a quick rundown of the storyline, but believe me, it's very complex. When the superheroes gather in Wakanda to stop Thanos from getting the final stone, which is the Mind Stone, the epic final battle ends in disaster, which is why fans are speculating about the outcome. I must admit, when I first watched the movie in the cinema, the ending baffled me, but after talking to a few die-hard fans, I knew that all was not what it seems. With that aside, the directors have kept the next instalment close to there chest, so anything can happen. I just hope that it's in the same class as this movie because it's hard to find a fault with it. They even toned down Spider-Man, who did get on my nerves in his standalone movie, and they gave everyone an equal amount of screen time, even though there were big names in the cast. Anyway, I think you can tell that I thought this movie was great, and I can see myself watching it many more times. Great! Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, who also brought you Welcome To Collinwood starring George Clooney, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War. They are currently making Avengers: Endgame, so it's good to see that the directors of this movie are returning for the final instalment. If it wasn't for the Captain America movies, they would have been my last choice for this film, but boy didn't they do a good job. At this precise moment, this movie is number 4 in the highest-grossing movies of all time list, but they still have time to take over Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which is in 3rd place. I still can't believe that Avatar and Titanic are still at the top of the list, after so many years. Anyway, Josh Brolin was perfect for Thanos. His facial expressions and deep voice made his character intense, which the role needed. I was a bit sceptical when I heard that the Guardians were going to be involved with, mainly because I thought their comedic personalities would have taken away the intensity of the situation but they also fit in perfectly. The wit that Taika Waititi brought to Thor, was carried into this film, even though he was battered at the beginning, so the directors have obviously been listening to the fans. Bring on the final chapter! Budget: $400million\nWorldwide Gross: $2.50Billion (WOW!)

After a few lacklustre 'origin' stories with a some decent films mixed in, Marvel have brought many stories and characters together into this film to provide a VERY entertaining romp. It's hugely dependent on the action and CGI and thankfully these are superbly handled as befits its astonishingly high budget. Although Spiderman in his first few swings still isn't quite right. Luckily, just like the last Spiderman movie it sorts itself out (is this an in-joke?). A nice simple story with a decent number of cracking one-liners built into a very adept script, allows the action to proceed with aplomb into its numerous excellent set-pieces. Great fun.

While this movie is not perfect, It was indeed a very well made movie, with the actors doing a top notch job as can be expected from the marvel cast. The story was very good and kept me engaged, and finally answered the question of why Thanos wanted all these shiny stones. Also I felt some sad emotions with some of the events, but I will not describe them as to not spoil the movie.", "This is not the end. This is Infinity war the culmination of ALMOST everything that has happened in the marvel cinematic universe until NOW. This is just round one of a bigger fight. Would you like to see how Thanos gets to search, assemble, use and lose a weapon of massive destruction in one movie, a movie which fans have been waiting for years to finally watch it?\n What do you think this is, Justice League and it's lame \"DCEU\"? Just one movie to end something that they put ten years of effort to make? \nMarvel invented the cinematic universe, nobody thought it was a good idea and they surprised the WORLD with what they have become. \nI'm not gonna lie, the movie had its flaws, but look how many others have tried.\nDC and Warner tried to make the same, but in five movies they are already crumbling apart.\nUniversal studios and it's \"monsterverse\" failed at the FIRST movie.\nStar Wars has tried but it is going down while trying to make a tenth movie.\nBut Marvel knows how to make it right. They managed to make 18 movies connected in this great event. Of course there were some flaws, but the did it, and they did it awesomely.\nThis is not the end, why did you thought that they called this movie \"Avengers Infinity War PART ONE\" before.\nEverybody but the fans thought this was the end, but this is just the beginning of the end of a twenty chapters story. Why did you thought there were so many kills? To make people return to see what happens next? NO! They did it because they knew that there were too many characters, and people were going to be mad at them for the short screen time. The end of this story will be in Avengers 4, but the saga will continue with 20 MORE CHAPTERS with a new story to tell. \nSay goodbye to the infinity stones.

Anyway, the actually film was flipping amazing!!!! There was none of the back stories or build ups or fluff pieces it was just a load of super heroes kicking backside!!!! Thor just owned it to be honest, Iron Man is awesome and my favourite character, Downey Junior carries the character now to be honest, they just keep increasing his powers probably to match these super duper evil guys but I dont think they need to, he is awesome as he is without extra nano super ridiculous hammer tech!! Make the armour harder and the beams more powerful to be honest or something, he doesn't need guardians of the galaxy god powers manipulating his suit. \nAnyway, the film is the beat yet even though I didn't want to see it, THOR rocks.", "If you are a fan of marvel movies THIS is the last LEVEL ! \n", "All these reviews with 1,2 and 3 stars obviously have no idea what a good movie is. It had a lot of special effects and cgi sure, but it is a superhero movie and the best one I have ever seen by far. I am a huge fan of all marvel movies but not just a fanboy who loves it just for the sake of it being a marvel movie. I have pretty much have seen almost any relavent movie over the last 40 years. I watch comedy, indie, horror, action, drama, romance etc. I have never left a movie feeling like I did at infinity war. It was a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. It had the best storyline, best action sequences, the ending was unbelievably sad even though we know it probobly won't end the way they showed as it is basically a 2 part movie and most of hero's have other movies coming out. Long story short best movie ever hands down. Besides it's one of the highest grossing movies ever so that alone should tell you just how good it is. Almost everyone has seen this at least once and if you haven't you should not let these people's negative opinion of the movie stop you from seeing it. You won't be disappointed!!!", "So good I saw it twice.  No spoilers here, go see this movie.", "This movie brought together all the marvel characters. It was great. The action was awesome. I am team Marvel.", "I saw this movie and it was amazing! So much action and drama with scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat and eyes glued to the screen. The ending truly makes the anticipation of a continuation high to know what happens next.", "Ten years ago, I wanted to see Iron Man, but I was nervous about it. To have it start with AC/DC Back in Black . . . I knew the movie was going to be awesome. Have all Marvel movies been gems? Not always, but I never found them horrible either. I'm still on the fence on Iron Man 3; I liked and hated the Mandarin twist but didn't like the \"exploding suits\" scene. And, Age of Ultron, I was a little disappointed with; after all, we were shown the destruction of the Avengers only to have it be a dream-sequence. This. Movie. Rocks. Within the first five minutes, BAM BAM BAM. I was in shock, mouth open, barely able to eat my popcorn. From there, to see all of the characters come together. You know, people always complain \"How can the Fantastic Four be in New York and not run into Spider-man?\", \"How can this person exist and not be know by this other hero?\" This movie combines them all, and yet I do see people complain (*cough* DC fans *cough*). Those reviewing this and not giving this movie anything above a 7, must have been watching Overboard. I've seen reviews as low as 1; what movie were they watching? I don't want to spoil anything. You've seen great details in the trailers. The ending? Shocking . . . and the way it should go. I absolutely loved this movie and plan on seeing it again. Marvel movies are awesome, they get me out of the real world (escapism), and are just far more fun than anything DC can produce. Seriously though, Marvel can tell a good story, real life story, with characters that have super abilities, versus a superhero movie with a story (the \"going to a fight and a hockey game broke out\" mentality).", "That's a lot of action, but good action, never too boring.\nI felt strange, unease about this movie, because unlike my expectations the story and some images remained in my memory long after having watched it.\nThat is a total different dimension compared to the 2 previous movies: I could not watch them completely stopping after 30 minutes. These 2 remains in the shallow waters, the deepest philosophy is about why Iron Man has lost his mask... \nI started to analyse why this third one is different, and basically this is simply because it bring me back in my youth, Moses, the story of prophets that have changed the face of the world, and ancient greek stories, and realised that the big picture of this movie is nothing different...\nAs the bible is not my preferred book, this film is deeply rooted in my feelings and despite it is not my preferred movie of all times, it is definitively a great one.", "Literally the best film of the whole Marvel MCU, filled with incredible battles, hilariously funny moments, and a shocking ending. Highly recommend this film.", "The greatest movie that I've seen. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh", "I enjoyed seeing all of the characters when they were needed, however the ending upsets me. I didn't want or expect them to end off like that. Overall Ot was an epic movie and I would watch it over and over.", "Avengers Infinity War is a film directed by the Russo Brothers. This film was my most anticipated film for this year and I can definitely say the same for every MCU fan out there. I viewed the film very late and knew how much I had to wait. But the wait was worth it. Plot: The Avengers team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from obtaining the 6 Infinity Stones. Story and Direction: The Russo Brothers and the writers had a huge and daunting task of bringing all of the characters that we loved for all these years into one big movie. And I can just say that they did an excellent job. Never for a moment do you feel that the characters were not given space and time to do what they wanted. The character work for this film is just flawless and I think Thanos was just the best villain MCU ever had. Although he is strong and kind of undefeatable, he has emotions which provided a lot of weight to his character. The film is has a much darker tone compared to other MCU films. The stakes in this film are very real and never there is rest for the mind. You do feel the tension lingering around and feel for the safety of your characters. But the film does retain that Marvel brand of humour in places. And all of the jokes are very funny and do provide relief. Given the film was shot on IMAX cameras, the visuals are just awesome. I had goosebumps just looking at how beautiful this film looked. Also the action scenes were awesome. And the VFX was just jaw dropping. Action scenes were just awesome. Although there were some shaky cam scenes, but they were just perfectly handled. The score by Alan Silvestri was quiet good and complemented the scenes very well. Also the film doesn't end in a very peculiar way. It takes a very different route, which was very well appreciated. I did have one little issue but here I am being quite nit-picky. Some scenes in the trailers didn't make it to the film which was disappointing and also the Thor storyline didn't feel much important to the film. Performances: The Avengers and The Guardians were just awesome with Thor being my favorite character in the entire film. His presence and his comic timing were just awesome. Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston too deliver good performances. Josh Brolin was just excellent as Thanos. Every time you watch him on screen you do feel that he was just the correct choice. Also the Black Order was nice to watch. And finally, Peter Dinklage. He also delivered an earnest performance for his role. Favorite Scene; It would be Thor's scene with the Guardians. That scene lightened the mopd for a bit and also gave that kind of entertainment you expect out of these characters. Verdict: This film satisfied the Marvel fan in me. I walked out of this film with a lot of questions about what will happen next and I can't just wait for the next instalment arriving next year. I am going with a 9/10.", "KACHOW!!! Every Cars movie was way better than this piece of crap film!", "So i've been expecting nothing surprising from this movie. Age of Ultron was average, Civil War and Black Panther were horrible and Thor was creativly a little different but still marvel level.\nBut IW really surprised me, i never thought they could make it interesting that everyone fights the same all mighty guy. But lets say they found a clever way that makes perfect sense. The movie itself feels like nice adventure with a lot of different settings and fights. Every character recieves enough time to feel relevant and plot appropiate. The humour is alright and sometimes even funny, never thought my grumpy self could say that. I absolutely despised the comedy in Guardians 2 and especially TLJ. Also Thanos is not a dumb villian Ultron was, he is actually interestingand has motives that one can understand, if to even relate. Thats always what makes good villians shine. All in all i am very surprised and loved the movie.", "The actors are Amazing and the memes are beatiful. I love Thor to mutch to hate This film he just have everything he is funny and Badass.  The humor in the film is just so good i love et", "A \"10\" for its genre, an \"8\" for a general movie, resulting in an overall \"9\". Marvel studios somehow managed to give nearly all of its superheros in a single movie, yet get each of them adequate screen time. Without going into details, the plot involves the intent of extermining half the life in the universe by a villain who is arguably the greatest menace ever put on any superhero or fantasy film.  The CGI and action is great and although there is some comedy, this is a dark movie and the ending is the most shocking ending I have ever seen in a movie (it has a sequel due to be released next year) except for perhaps, the original Planet of the Apes movie. Not a perfect film, but pretty close to it, especially considering the difficulty in interacting many characters.", "Went into the theater with low expectations, and left blown away!", "I like it!I like it!I like it!I like it!I like it!I like it!", "And yet at the same time, I feel greater. Marvel has not just outdone itself, it has exceeded the expectations of the movie genre in a way that hasn't been done since The Dark Knight. After Winter Soldier and Civil War and now this, Anthony and Joe Russo should go down in history next to the Coen Brothers for their masterpiece of film.  Josh Breiling undeniably steals the show with his magnificent performance as Thanos. The Mad Titan's philosophy of balanced genocide could have been handled in the same way as Lee Pace's Ronin: a one- dimensional monologing maniac. Instead, he truly believes his solution will bring peace, loves his daughter Gamora with all his heart, and goes through great pain in his quest for the Infinity Stones. And in the end, he wins. Half the universe's sentient turns to dust, and the final shot is him looking into the sunset, smiling in the new reality he has created. In my opinion, he is the most intriguing character ever written to screen. You will not leave this movie happy, or hopeful. In fact, after seeing Peter Parker die in the arms of Tony Stark, or even before that when Thanos kills the one thing he loves most, Gamora, there was only sadness. And yet I am happy for having seen it. For over 10 years I've watched all of the MCU, defined by youth, and One day begged to one day become Captain America The reason being is that the acting, SFX, writing, suspense, emotion, comedy, action, and payoff are the perfect in every way. It is the greatest roller coaster of emotion at the greatest scale in the greatest movie series i've ever seen. And for that, it may just be the greatest accomplishment in movie history.", "Unlike, it seems, everybody else, I'm still a newcomer to the Marvel Universe. I've seen two previous movies - the ones where the raccoon stars but none other. So I was a bit confused as to who everybody was and why they can do the things that they can.  Putting that aside, I really marveled at the CGI craft here. I won't say it's the best ever since I'm hardly an expert but it sure was better, in some ways, than what I've ever seen in the past except for Avatar - a movie almost a decade old now. The downside of the CGI was the constant fast cuts meaning, at least for me, little comprehension of the action during fights. I only figured out who won a particular fight after it was over. I never had that issue with Avatar.  I'll get right to my issue here. The plot is utterly senseless. The bad guy, who is weirdly the most sympathetic and best developed character, has a plan which is senseless. It can't work even if he achieves his stated goal. However, his ends can be met by other means. I was waiting for a character, any character, to sit down with this guy and together work out a plan which will achieve the bad guy's desires but also cause no misery or destruction.  Then too we have the tired issue of time travel not taken. This pervades any show where time travel exists. There's no reason for a time traveler to experience a bad outcome since he can jump back in time as often as needed to remedy the issue. Here, the good guys get the bad guy under their power and are about to prevail when one of the good guys does something moronic which caused the bad guy to escape. Well, Mr. Time Traveler, go back a few minutes so you can stop this from occurring.  There are other holes too. People have magical powers which wax and wane. One minute some woman is easily defeated by the bad guy and next is able to fend him off using only part of her power. That sort of inconsistency is rampant.  Well, it was a good show even if it bugged me due to it simply doing whatever it wished without attention to what happened previously. I feel I got my money's worth and you'll get more if you also shut your brains off while watching.", "'Avengers: Infinity War' smashed the box office record for biggest opening weekend taking in $258 million on its way to sprinting past a billion dollars in worldwide receipts, becoming the fastest movie ever to do so. The writing, visual effects, and a truly overwhelming amount of star power all make this film worthy of holding the title of reigning box office king. But my predominant thought leaving the theater was wondering who the hell could possibly follow the film's dizzying two-and-a-half hour story arc ... much less all the individual Marvel story arcs that preceded it, considering 'Infinity War' is the culmination of 18 different superhero movies.  I recognized most of the actors (and most of their characters). But when you have three or four (?) different groups of heroes fighting three or four (?) different groups of baddies on three or four (?) different planets the film quickly turns into an all-you-can-eat buffet of action that, while still very appetizing, is quite a different experience than that of a neatly composed--and somewhat moderately portioned--meal.", "Of the best films Marvel I can not wait for the next season The film is wonderful and deserves a rating 10/10", "It was a great film, I watched it in one breathe, the ending was a surprise, but that was the meaning and it told that that's not the end!!!!

It was entertaining at the time but it really was nothing more than a \"look how many big name actors we fit into one movie\" experience.", "The film was really good, it's exciting, sad in a way and it gets you hooked. At the end we know some might come back with the help of the avengers and captain marvel, at least that's my theory.", "As we all know the why the movie is great but there are many cons. As a comic book fan we see that thanos lost his mad titan tittle actually. The movie thanos is just a bigger version of Ra's al ghul. Weakest thanos ever.....\nNow this movie has major plot holes. May some of them will be answered in captain marvel and infinity war 2. But i don't think that those answer will properly explain. Like why thanos or avengers didn't use stones properly instead of they use it after some cinematic trouble, after seeing alternative futures why dr strange didn't prepare quil properly etc.\nThis movie is the best marvel movie no doubt . They provide very little amount of classy action scene. They just try to make people emotional fool except 2 or 3 scenes. Black order failed to their comic greatness. Characters did not get enough screen time. And those characters died who already got their sequel.\nHumour is the pros and cons too of this movie. As some were fitted properly where some ruins the tone. \nBut the movie provides a great adventure after all. Tight scripts and the suspension for the future movies makes the movie better.", "No words to explain this movie..wonderful..Thanos is the best", "I worried about how well executed this film would be because of how large the cast is. I clearly didn't need to though. This film is worth every minute of its 2.5 hours.  The flow of each character's individual story and their connection to the over all plot is done seamlessly. It is never focus too long on one area and you are moved from one scene to the next in a way that doesn't feel jarring. I was completely immersed into the story. I only give it nine stars because it made me cry and I'm mad about it.", "Such a fun movie. Perfect ending. Cool jokes. Many nicely made storylines.", "As an ardent mutual fan of both DC and Marvel i was badly waiting for this movie to come out. When it released i went in without any expectations and i liked this movie. Some aspects which i liked:- 1. This movie has focused on its villian THANOS and has given a good hints to the fans about both his emotional and his malignant nature. And Josh Brolin has given a full justice to this role. 2. Iron Man's new suit and Spiderman's new suit. 3. Thor's new hammer and his entry in the middle of the war. 4. This movie has deleniated on the infinity stones.  Some aspects which i disliked:- 1. The movie was very lenghty it could have been shortened. 2. Action was not included much and also 3D effects were lame.  3. As i said above, the story was deliberately stretched. Overall it was a good movie.", "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the second-most-expensive film ever made. 96% google users liked this film. You must watch it!", "The best Avenger movie ever, i'm very enjoyed the movie.", "AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR ****SPOILER FREE REVIEW**** \"There was once an idea..\" that the superhero films was a genre considered in Hollywood as a joke. Hollywood pushed out terrible comic films that barely scratched the surface of greatness. We are 10 years and 18 films deep into the Marvel Studios franchise that is the MCU, and Infinity War is thus far the pinnacle of the example of what the culmination of calculated storytelling is supposed to be in a franchise.  I will not describe too much about the film but I honestly want all you guys to know that this is the darkest film yet from MCU. There will always be humor to relieve the audience from the heavy stress this film deals on those who have been longtime fans.  The film does an excellent job of mixing and matching characters during the film, and the chemistry is believable; the action, incredible.  What's great: the action, the dialogue, THANOS.  What's not so great: At times, heartfelt character moments didn't get enough time to breathe to then get overshadowed by comedy. It's not annoying, but it does tug at both spectrums of emotions, leaving you almost numb on how to feel in certain moments.  Overall, this is still a must-see. Don't miss this, be a part of history this weekend!!", "This is the first MCU movie that I went to watch at the theatre.This long awaited movie created so much hype that even I could not resist the temptation of watching the endgame on a big screen.Being a long time marvel comics fan I was already well informed about the infinity gems(called infinity stones in the MCU) and of course The Mad Titan Thanos and his Black Order(named Children of Thanos in MCU).I am mentioning this not to brag my knowledge or something but because I felt that some scenes of the movie were really meant for the hardcore fans and my friend(not a hardcore comic fanatic himself) with whom I went to spectate this spectacle did not understand and enjoy some scenes to the extent I myself did.Anyway I would like to point out some pros and cons first. Pros :- \n1)The direction is really great.Directing an epic like this looked almost impossible.Managing the massive roster of this movie and making sure that it doesn't turn out to be a mess is commendable.The Russo brothers deserve a bow for their near flawless direction.\n2)The CGI is near perfect as it always is with the MCU movies.The movie looked really vibrant and colorful.Thanos's CGI in the trailer was a bit disappointing but the final cut is way better.\n3)The acting is really great especially Benedict Cumberbatch and Chris Hemsworth particularly stand out.I would even go on to say that they outshine RDJ in this one.\n4)The references from the comics are the best part of the movie.The iconic snap of fingers scene from the Infinity Gauntlet series is directly taken which is a big treat for the longtime fans.Moreover, the falling of The Hulk into Dr. Strange's sanctum sanctorum and disassembled Nebula are reminiscent of the Infinity Gauntlet series except it was Silver Surfer who falls instead of Hulk in the comics.Even the farmer Thanos is taken from the aforementioned series.There are more of them but these are particularly worth mentioning for me.\n5)The music is really great.Feels appropriate at all the places.Alan Silvestri gets the job done.\n6)Finally a really great MCU villain.Thanos is one of the iconic villains of the Marvel Comics and the movie version does not disappoint.The entire story revolves around him and boy is he the one to watch out for. Cons :-\n1)Editing is not up to the mark.It feels like some scenes are cut short unnecessarily and some are inappropriately stretched long.Some important characters do not get enough screentime.\n2)Marvel should have taken a bit more risk this time.Something feels wrong all the time.We get to see the battles,the deaths,the emotions but nothing feels like groundbreaking.We get very few scenes where our minds are blown off.\n3)Though the CGI is near perfect most of the times,the Children of Thanos does not look that great.They looked like Marvel's version of Steppenwolf from Justice League(in a very bad way).\n4)Starlord loosing his temper and attacking Thanos despite knowing the consequences looks really stupid and selfish.The writers could have thought of something else here. I have read some reviews on this site and some of the points few people mentioned,felt inappropriate to me.I would like to mention some of them here and explain why they felt so to me. 1)A lot of people complained about no plot and character development which I feel is wrong.The MCU is a 10 year old franchise and most of the main characters have had their own solo movies.The plot of this last battle has been developing for 10 years now and there really isn't much left to develop except well......the battle itself.\n2)Killing off some important characters looked unnecessary for some people because many of them will eventually come back as they have their own upcoming solo movies.But this is what actually happens in the comics and trust me,you can not bring people wiped out from the reality by just using the time stone as suggested by some people.What brings back those people in the comics I will not reveal here but if that is anywhere near what is going to happen in the next part,it will be EPIC.So I am not at all disappointed with the ending.It just increased my expectations with the next one. Anyway I never expected it to be a classic or something and neither it is.It is a really great popcorn movie and surely worth a watch. PS:-The place where Thanos meets Gamora after wiping out half the universe may possibly be the soul world!!!!!!!! Have a nice day............", "Perfect movie for a marvel fan. As a fan who has watched all the previous movies and has followed the franchise, I can say that this movie has very much exceeded my expectations. This movie is packed with very emotional scenes, humour when appropriate, great action and an amazing storyline. What I didn't expect was how they portrayed Thanos by showing an emotional side to him unlike most supervillains. I had goosebumps all over me during some scenes because they were just so well-directed and just straight-up cool. I would've given it a ten except I thought that the way they killed off Loki was totally unheroic. 5 minutes into the movie and Loki is strangled to death without any sort of a memorable ending. I know how the directors wanted to be bold and kill off some characters but really? Heimdall's death was not in vain as he did something heroic before he died. Also Gamora's death was very emotional so, no complaints. But Loki, as a fan-favourite character, should have been given a memorable death. That's my only complain with the movie. Other than that, mind-blowing movie and can't wait for the next part.", "Stunning cinematography and effects, some excellent performances, superb story and a light smattering of comedy. A fantastic fantastic movie. Quite possibly my new favourite!", "In avengers infinity war the protagonists are not the super heroes that we finally see for the first time all together in a mix of action scenes and dialogues that the Russo brothers have cleverly calibrated, the real protagonist is Thanos. And from this point of view, the film ends very well. Maybe the next movie title will be about Thanos while the protagonists in the end will really be the Avengers", "Movie was Superb in all way but what was \"Guardians of galaxy\",s heroes was doing in this movie? nothing.\n& main important thing - man whole universe is at stake but where are other aliens & there's heroes?? LOL\n& lol...Thanos has only 4 buddy..", "This film does justice to the characters, the cinematic universe, the source material, and most importantly, the fans who've supported the MCU and have been waiting for this specific story to begin to unfurl. It's a THRILLING cinematic experience. The first part of a five hour biblical epic in the skin of a galactic comic book space opera. This is studio film-making on the narrative and production scale of Peter Jackson's Middle Earth movies and old studio epics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra, El CID, and The Ten Commandments (only with loads more CGI).  Selfishly , I only wished that the story could somehow have been presented in all of its five hour glory. Truth be told, I hate having to wait another year for its conclusion.  But anyway, here's a spoiler free summation of my thoughts: The plot of the movie is pretty basic: Thanos comes to earth and a bunch of other planets in search of the stones needed to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet. The Avengers must stop him. You already knew that. But the execution was nearly flawless. Marvel studios and all the filmmakers did an amazing job of making a very coherent storyline from the countless characters and threads the movie had to weave together and converge with Thanos, played with fantastic intelligence and subtlety by Josh Brolin. Thanos isn't you typical mustachio twirling scene chewing bad guy. He's surprisingly quite and sensible giving him a really calm, almost Hannibal lector like sense of menace. And he looks great. Actually all of the actors in the movie, namely the heroes, gave solid performances. But the real standouts for me were Chris Hemsworth, whose really has come into his own in the last year as Thor, and Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange. Those two characters have some of the best scenes in the movie and have some of the best repartee. On that note: The humor in the movie mostly fell flat, even when it was amusing. The stakes of the movie were just way too big, the tension just too high, for me to laugh. But that's just me. The action sequences were freaking phenomenal right from the gate. This movies action does NOT disappoint. And the movie doesn't go cheap with Thanos fighting...I'll just stop myself right there :)\nWhat was much less exciting was the action involving Thanos' henchman. But that may be due to the fact that the filmmakers were very inconsistent with there power level and the power level of some of the other Avengers in the numerous fight sequences. Nothing takes me out of an action scene quicker than when characters who've I've seen portrayed on film, in some cases numerous times, have their powers nerfed or juiced up. In movies, like an many other things, consistency is key. But again, that's just me. Now...at this stage I don't think mentioning that there were casualties is a spoiler. But i won't get into specifics, either in terms of a number or a name. What I will say is that even if you're a casual MCU fan like I am, and you've seen all the movies, nothing will, or at least should, shock you. The biggest shock is in the way the filmmakers handle the key moment in the film... its darkest hour so to speak. That small moment, one simple action that was cleverly set up throughout the film, was incredibly poetic and haunting. I'm not lying when I say that you could literally feel the air leave the theater when it happened. Absolutely splendid. Made the movie for me. What followed in the last five minutes or so was a mix of good and okay. Nothing surprising to me. That's really where the fact that the movie is only part one of a larger story came back to hurt my enjoyment of it. I would also say that the nature of Thanos' goal, which I won't spoil, also played a part in that. The movie tried to tug on my emotional heart strings but the loss Thanos inflected on the heroes simply didn't cut close enough to the spine of the heroes to really make me feel anything. I'm dancing around this point but in general, the better you know someone, the more you're emotionally invested in them, and the more it hurts when there gone. I'll leave it at that.  \nI'll close with stating that if your even a casual MCU fan you'll really enjoy Infinity War. It's a magnificent big screen sci-fi/space opera epic...just don't expect it to give you closure or really big emotional payoffs. Infinity War is as stated at the start, a part one film...and a damned good one at that. It's thoroughly entertaining and brilliantly sets the table for what promises to be an even grander Infinity War Part II... I mean Avengers 4 ;)", "Marvel's most ambitious title yet revels in it's frequently remarkable computer generated imagery. From the piercingly realistic Thanos to the glorious depiction of otherworldly planets, it's difficult not to succumb to awe and wonder. Additionally, the action sequences here are earnestly more successful than in the scandalously overrated Black Panther. However, it may be argued that the narrative's dark tone comes into conflict with the protagonists' humorous dialogue, dampening the atmosphere.  Despite the positive reception to major antagonist Thanos, his depth amounts to little more than a somewhat contrived origin story.", "I loved this. This movie had everything what a awesome Marvel movie needs: menacing and excellent main villain, lots of interesting and likeable superheroes, amazing fight scenes and and great humour. This is easily the darkest Marvel movie so far and its shows very well throught out the runtime. Everyone gives excellent perfromance as usual. Thanos is interesting and menacing villain and Josh Brolin did fantastic job as voicing him. The CGI for him was done really really well. His quest is to get all six infinity stones to his gauntlet and nothing is stopping him to achieve that goal. Overall: This doesnt get full 10/10 because there is little too much humour for this dark movie but I liked most of the jokes and I was having a blast watching this. I also think that not all superheroes got the chance to shine.  It will not be easy to wait the sequel.", "Best Marvel movie by far, I don't know why you have to fill out a certain amount space and this review it's kind of stupid", "Everyone needs to see this movie. Disney and Marvel once again, deliver a mind blowing movie experience. From start to finish, my jaw was on the floor! Best movie ever", "The most anticipated crossover presents us the search for the infinity stones by one of the best villains in the cinema in general ... Thanos the \"crazy titan\" that had been shown to us from the post-credit scene of The Avengers in 2012, after a Great cameo in Guardians of the galaxy in 2014 and for the last time in the post credit scene of Avengers age of Ultron. The film focuses on showing us why Thanos wants to opt for all the infinity strones since he believes that with them he could bring balance to the universe by annihilating half of it, and thus save it from itself, because of the overpopulation and lack of resources in the universe . The movie is full of epicity, insertity, and is full of surprises, the whole ensemble of characters is perfectly balanced. All the characters retain their personality, and shine one by one, the teams are fantastic. The action is unexpected, from the first minute of the pecula there are completely epic ballas and with good choreography, the tension is felt throughout the film being sanded with classic MCU humor no joke feels forced, they are necessary to release tension. The end of the movie is something so unexpected and surprising, without a doubt it is the best movie of superheroes in history, and it becomes more than that since it has a plot that is totally well realized and a villain who is totally well written that ends up being the protagonist of this epic infinity war that leaves us thinking seriously about the future of our heroes and the MCU.", "I couldn't be more shocked by a movie. My heart was beating so fast from minute one until the last minute. My legs were shaking after leaving the theater.\nIt is a thrilling ride with ups and downs (mostly downs). Many people say that it is exhausting because there are too many characters and too many things going on, but you cannot criticize this movie from this factor only. This is the movies nature. It was meant to be like that, to exhaust you until the last minute. On the other hand, there were too many characters but each and every one of them is shown equally with an enormous dynamic for all of them. Also, the scenes that were running simultaneously were masterfully crafted to fit in the story so that everything can end up the way it ended. \nYes, there were many deaths and many of those deaths made us cry and made us emotionally unstable. But this is the movie, a movie about the possible end of the world. \nThanos is the best villain that Marvel ever created. He threw Killmonger out of the window. We've seen an extraordinary part of his character. He is not the bad villain that everyone was waiting for. We've seen his good side in many perspectives, his only love. But we've seen what he is capable to do to accomplish his mission.\nAt last what Avengers: Infinity War has that no other superhero movies has is that ending. Those 10 last minutes that will haunt you forever and you will never forget them. Things take an unexpected turn at those 10 last minutes that you are not only left speechless but you leave the theater with your mouth fully open from surprise and your legs shaking from disbelief. \nIt's of course the first part of a two part movie because it leaves you with an enormous cliffhanger but let's not forget May 2019 is not too far away from now.\nThus, this movie is a must see for all the marvel moviegoers and fans but also for people that have some knowledge on the movies background story. The cast and crew of this movie deserve a big applause and an enormous bravo from the entire world. I cannot believe that I've lived to see this movie. I quote what common sense media said \"This is the most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet\"", "Avengers Infinity War is the best movie this year so far it has action jokes and the best of all a good story", "This might be ONE of the biggest movies of all time, aside from the superhero genre. This is part one of the final journey of our favorite heroes as they battle against the powerful titan. The movie started quite a bit off - fast paced and rushed introduction of some of the characters, which I think we all could go along with since we've already met them.  I saw the movie on 3D and the fight sequences made me dizzy but I shook it off because of the story and I want to keep an eye on every scene because THERE AREN'T DULL SCENES in this movie. Yes, you might say that some scenes with chit-chat could be dull but, every scene is important and plays a role for this movie. My friend saw the movie at 2D and told me that it was great. Maybe, I'll watch it again. This time on 2D to focus more. With some of the small flaws I've said, the movie was still good. With these too many characters, we should give the Russo brothers an applause for still pulling it off and made a HISTORICAL film. This is the very first time that I've seen audiences shocked, speechless and drained after the movie ends. I've also heard that one person fainted after Infinity War because of the ending. And this shows that people are so attached with the characters and that we all love them that the ending had the effect on us. Yes, we all might be speechless, shocked and \"WTF?\" and it was because, again, the movie did it right. Some of the scenes were like pulled off from the comics. Thanos might be the best villain in the MCU with his motivation and the depth of his backstory. With that said, here's my final tip and quote from Doctor Strange movie: Forget everything you think you know. Forget everything about your theories because this movie will blow your mind.", "What a great sequel. The script was great, comedy and drama. Bringing together a lot of the characters from the Marvel universe worked amazingly well. Will see it again tomorrow. Bravo", "AVENGERS INFINITY WAR REVIEW : A wait of so many years, an anticipation built through so many superhero movies and wait for Super Villain finally comes to the end with Large scale visual spectacular called Infinity War. I was so excited but kept expectations low as such superhero flicks entertain you but usually lacks the content. Infinity War is Super Entertaining, it has all the elements what one expect from Marvel's Biggest Film ever but why such Incomplete, complicated and negative end? \nFilm starts on the good note, doesn't take too much time to set unlike other Superhero films. Thanos looks so powerful and we don't wanna see our Avengers looking so weak for the first time. We expect them to smash Thanos but we'll have to wait for Infinity War 2 for that and that's where film looks slightly incomplete at the end. Watch out for the post end credit scene, that might increase your excitement for the sequel. When film ended i felt like it's Interval and i want to see more, but have to wait 1 year more for that. Poor me. Film has so many pluses but has got some minuses too. Let's take a look at them.\nPluses- Visually spectacular, goosebumps while seeing so many superheroes together and their strong come-Backs, Strong Villain, pacy screenplay, Comedy, Explosion etc.\nMinuses- Heroes looking Weak in front of Villain, unnecessary love making scenes between few avengers, useless emotional scenes between Thanos & Gamora, Lose climax, so many unanswered questions.\nOverall, Avengers Infinity War is just another Entertaining film from Marvel, nothing Extraordinary despite gathering 20+ superheroes in a single film. Film worths the long wait of viewers but nothing memorable to be left with. Film left viewers with more questions than answers. The excitement for the film was so high that some fans even went on to predict that this film will beat Box office records of Avatar, Sorry to say this, forget Avatar but even $2 Billion can't happen with this Product. I will not say you should skip the film but i can't even strongly recommend you. I'm going with 7/10* which is same as almost every superhero film from Marvel has got from me. Last but not the least, there are No such things called spoilers like who dies in the end, so many disappears but only to come back in a style with Infinity War 2.", "Yeah that's right I'm giving this movie a 10/10. I found 2 mistakes in the film: 1) when Peter didn't come to the right mind of asking where Gamora is until after the gauntlet was off would've been to easy. They showed how Thanos was a being, yes he is a Titan but he is a living thing that could die if he was stabbed or shot in the right place. This wasn't ultron nor Loki, \"this time, there are resurrections.\" It was good in every way. Thanos is probably one of the greatest supervillians of all time next to Darth Vader and Christopher Nolans Joker. I feel like every ones character had a good participant role no matter the size. Now last, this movie is probably one of the greatest films of all time; you might say I'm pushing to far but think about it..it has everything you could possibly make a movie good. wasn't at all predicable and caught your attention every moment. Love this movie I'm bumping it up to my top 10", "Infinity War is a gathering of the greats and the movie does justice to possibly all the characters while maintaining the consistency of the previous movies yet developing the characters further.It is filled with amazing action sequences (a Marvel tradition) and an ending scene that is unexpected, sad, yet bold. This is not the average Marvel movie plot which makes the movie hype all the worth it despite a rather tragic ending.", "Avengers infinity war was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had In a marvel movie the movie succeeds on entertainment value alone and the ending had me frozen in my seat. Unfortunately it's suffers from some poor character development except for with thanos who shines through as one of my favourite marvel villains. All the set pieces are memorable and more than up to standard as expected and we do get a lot of plot which is good because the lead up meant a lot needed to happen and it definitely delivered. Another great aspect was the sense of desperation that was a strong theme throughout the movie and it held a constant sense of tension during the whole runtime and did not hold back in what it did to some characters", "I cannot contain my excitement! This film is the very best the MCU has to offer. It gives you a lot of thrills and shocks from the get go. All the cast members were incredible especially Brolin himself. His take on the mad titan is so daunting yet so relatable. (Not the best father figure) but you can see the time and effort which has gone into the character. Also he is an absolute beast!!! (Like Barney the dinosaur on roids) the storyline is captivating and for such a massive ensemble of all star actors, the film delivers and keeps the viewer interested and does not feel to overpowering and overcrowded at any time. The cast work so well together from the very serious scenes to the comedic timing of other scenes. a blend of drama and action really set the tone on why MCU is destroying DC films at the moment. Great watch 10/10", "I really really hate what MCU is doing with Spider-Man. Whenever they do popularity vote on all the superheroes, Spider-Man always comes in 3rd behind Superman and Batman. Which makes him the most popular Marvel superhero. Yet MCU just turns him into a whiny sidekick of Ironman who constantly seeks his approval. And the suit all made by Tony Stark. Come on man. This is \"THE\" Spider-Man. This is why I hated Homecoming too. They're destroying Spider-Man. I still can't understand a word Chadwick says and he still can't act. Other than that, I enjoyed it. I liked the fact that they put more personality and character to Thanos and he's not just mindless destroyer like most villains. I don't like how the movie's ending leaves you hanging but I think it was necessary to display the power of the Infinity Gauntlet. Few other disappointment was no Adam Warlock and Hawkeye. Not sure if Warlock will appear on next one... although writers confirmed he wont be. But they showed the teaser of him at end of GG vol2 post-credit scene and have him omitted for Infinity War is a crime.", "So tired of women playing 2nd fiddle and weaker parts in the Marvel universe.

I'm hoping to see Avengers 4 next summer. Of all the Avengers films so far, this is my favorite. It's basically The Empire Strikes Back of the Marvel films. PS: Stay after the credits to see a scene!", "Best movie ever and the story is awesome..........,...............", "Infinity War is the nineteenth movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so it makes sense people expect nothing else than the same characters fighting and joking. However, this movie is so much more than that. This isn't just a typical Marvel movie. This movie brings together 23 superheroes and concludes 18 previous installments to lead to the ultimate climax: a battle with the greatest and strongest villain of all time, Thanos (who raises in my opinion to the same height as iconic villains like Darth Vader or Voldemort). Thanos is more than a villain: he is a titan with the sole purpose of making the world a better place, only in the complete wrong way. Josh Brolin delivers an astonishing performance of this character and puts more to him than just a baddy, and makes him to someone who actually cares. \nAs for the superheroes, Joe and Anthony Russo perfectly managed to give every single one of them a moment to shine. Special credits go to Robert Downey Jr, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Hemsworth and Paul Bettany.\nThe movie gives us not only a ton of humor, but also some memorable though heartbreaking scenes which puts a different tone to the film than all the others. \nThere is a strong build up with some spectacular action sequences (where the heroes are divided into smaller groups so that every person has his time to shine), and the film ultimately leads to an epic and amazing climax with an unexpected ending. Well done Marvel.", "This is an masterpice heartbreaking movie first time villian wins thanos is the best villian ever", "This movie is epic in all definitions. 19 movies to add up to this and it could not have been better. I was slightly skeptical a couple of years back, but after the last couple of Marvel movies (Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Thor Ragnorok) I had high hopes, and they were most def met!!! This movie makes the inner comic book nerd child in me drool in amazement!", "WHAT CAN I SAY BUT WOW ABSOLUTELY AWESOME \nNOT BEEN MUCH OF A FAN OF THE PREVIOUS ONES BUT THIS IS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL COMPLETELY \nALL OTHER MARVEL FILMS I LOVE BUT THEM BEING TOGTHER I WASNT SO IMPRESSED WITH BUT NOW THIS LATEST : )", "Expect the first part of 2. Sadly, my biggest issue is the suspension of disbelief over the nanotech.", "Don't understand the negative comments. The film was solid. Lived up to the hype.", "For context, I'm a huge MCU fan, thus my review towards the title might be a bit biased. I do ultimately think though, that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, probably even the best. I want to start off with the vast greatness of the whole MCU. All the previous movies, building up characters, defeating various villains.. Everything led to this moment, where the heroes finally get their ultimate test. I actually do think this movie probably isn't nearly as enjoyable if you haven't seen the other MCU movies, leading up to this.  The plot was intensive, starting off from ruins of Asgard's people. I just found it incredible how fast they actually managed to show Thanos's power, desire and ambition for his mission. I think the character itself was also portrayed really well. Thanos radiated charm, he was a really good speaker, thus he was relatable in it's own way. Ruthless, but still thoughtful and well-spoken. I actually have developed a habit where I keep checking the clock during the movie to see for how long I've been watching. It helps me to comprehend how immersed I am into the movie. I've got to say, I didn't check the clock once during this movie, and I also felt like the movie ended really quickly. I was so immersed.  I also just love the actors portraying each of the avenger. Because we see the actors rather often in new Marvel titles, I've kind of started to see them as the characters themselves. I couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Stark, or Spiderman at this point.  To close this off, the movie really threw me off with the anti-cliche ending. We're so used to see the superheroes winning every time, I actually wasn't expecting it. I didn't know there's a sequel coming up before I saw the movie, thus it was quite an surprise to me. I also really haven't delved into the realm of comics so I had no expectations. The melancholic music kicking in when the credits started rolling was just.. I literally had no words. I couldn't think anything to say to my friends. I was just too mind blown. That sums up my thoughts and the experience about the movie. I'm quite excited about the sequel. MCU has been killing it during the recent MCU movies and I hope they'll keep doing it !", "This film has finally come. It took 10 years but it was worth it. Ever since The Avengers fans have been teased with post credits scenes and films leading up to this film. I was impressed on to how they made this film. It's helmed by the Russo brothers who directed the last two captain America films which have been brilliant. The plot follows Thanos as he travels the galaxy looking for the infinity stones and the avengers and guardians of the galaxy have to stop him. They divide into three teams One is on earth and the two are set up in space. This movie isn't film. It's an event and what I mean by an event is that this film is a massive pop culture event that fans of the marvel cinematic universe will enjoy. But if your not then this movie isn't really for you as A. You probably won't know who most of the characters are and B. You will need to sit through 18 movies to understand the characters. The best thing about this movie is the plot and the vfx. The vfx in this film are probably the best this year thanos looks brilliant. But I don't know whether some of the other cgi will hold up like iron mans new armour or mark ruffalo in the hulkbuster. The vfx are better than the black panther ones and they only came out two months apart. So that tells you something. It shows that every penny that went into the vfx was worth it. The movie has one of the best entrances by Thor which was absolutely the best thing. This movie is hardly focused on the heroes it's in fact mostly focused on thanos as he goes through the galaxy searching for the stones. He is the best character in this film josh brolin gives an oscar worthy performance. Also thanos wins by collecting the stones and wiping half the universe. It was so unexpected aswell cause the movie give some you hope thinking they can win. But they don't.", "If it wasn't for all of the edgy kids who think it's \"cool\" to give this masterpiece a 1/10, this movie would have made at least top 3 greatest movies of all time.", "Hypothesis on Infinity War epic: Group A:\na) Read everything available about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, AND\nb) Saw each of the movies in succession as they came out.

Then, like a comic book, I can be watching one characters film and another hero can appear. I loved crossover comics and I love crossover movies as well! This film features several comic book characters and Thanos, whom I have been anticipating in a Marvel movie since they teased him in the original Avengers film. I was disappointed a bit by the second Avengers film (still enjoyed it overall) as they went with Ultron as the villain and then later got more disappointed when I read somewhere that the Abomination was originally going to be in the film, but they scrapped the idea. That would have really given that film the kick it needed. This one though was not a disappointment at all as I got to see Thanos be as totally awesome as he is in the comics and I got to see many of my favorite superheros on the big screen at the same time! The story has Thanos, the mad titan, collecting infinity stones as he makes quick work of both the Hulk and Thor! The Asgardian ship seen in the previous Thor film is decimated as Thanos collects yet another stone and soon sends his children to Earth to collect the stone within Vision's forehead and the one protected by Dr. Strange. Thanos, himself, goes to the collector to retrieve the stone left in the Collector's care. Tony Stark ends up getting a warning from old friend Bruce Banner who gets back to Earth thanks to Heimdall and soon the children of Thanos make their attack as Tony must once again don the Iron Man armor to fight off these attackers and try to protect Dr. Strange's time stone. He gets some help from his friendly neighborhood protege, but all three end up on the ship of this weird dude who has very powerful telekinetic powers. Bruce Banner is left on Earth and he makes the call to Captain America who has to try and hold off the hordes of creatures that come for Vision's stone and does so by going to Wakanda where he will get the aid of the Black Panther and his old friend. Meanwhile, the Guardians of the Galaxy recover Thor and soon Thor, Groot and Rocket go to a place where Thor can get a powerful weapon to fight Thanos, while the rest of the Guardians try to stop Thanos at the Collector's. The power Thanos wields though is truly terrifying and things keep becoming vastly more difficult for all the heroes! The thing I enjoyed most was seeing all the different heroes interacting together. I was not expecting Dr. Strange, Spider-man or the Guardians to be in the film as much as they were. I was expecting more like extended cameos. I enjoyed watching Iron Man and the group on Titan fighting Thanos as they did a really amazing job of combating him. The only thing I wish there was more of is Captain America as he just did not really factor into the movie much at all being a bit ineffective. I also want him back with his regular shield too! Still, just a minor complaint in a movie that completely wowed me for the most part.  So yes, this was a very good comic book movie. I do believe I enjoyed it more than the first Avenger film which I also loved as this one was just so overwhelming and did so many cool things. This one also featured the best villain in Thanos, who they did really good with, making him almost sympathetic at times. The action was great in this one as all the battles were totally off the chain and as I said watching Dr. Strange, Iron Man and Starlord together on the same screen was simply great. I look forward to the next Avengers film coming thankfully next year. At first I thought it was not coming out until 2020, that would have been a very difficult wait!", "Marvel Studios has over the years come under criticism for its lack of great villains in their movies. I'm not sure I totally agree with that assessment as I always thought Loki was pretty good, and Michael Keaton's Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming I really liked, I have to say. The Winter Soldier was another great one I reckon, as was the Red Skull. But I guess I can see where people are coming from with regards to some. Thanos however, more than makes up for any villainous shortcomings in the MCU. He wields awesome power with his nefarious intentions, but Marvel also manage to give him an incredible depth and intriguing method to his madness in this latest confluence of superheroes from all over the universe. We've known Thanos has been coming big time for a number of movies now and in this latest blockbuster he arrives with a bang. Or maybe more with a click of the fingers. Anybody who knows anything about the mad Titan and his skullduggerous designs on the universe in the comic books knows that that is pretty much all he has to do to achieve massive genocide on a galactic scale once he gets all six of the Infinity Gems in his gauntlet. Can Earth's Mightiest Heroes the Avengers, as well as a number of others and Galaxy Guardians stop him? Well, like many others over the record-breaking opening weekend, you will have to go and see the movie to find out. Of course, the movie technically comes in two parts even though the second instalment is not going to be 'Infinity War part two' as originally announced, but rather named something else. A title that was apparently held back because it might have spoiled certain aspects of this movie. It's never going to be easy incorporating so many different characters into one film - many of which who are pretty big in the comic book and movie world already - but following previous success with The Winter Soldier and Civil War, the Russo brothers pull this off again to great effect. This movie does jump around the universe a lot from scene-to-scene, but has a very interesting ending indeed. And for god's sake, unlike many others who still appear to not have cracked the code yet, make sure you stay for the post-credits scene. Because if you know anything about any of the characters in the spacey world of (Captain) Marvel, the next couple of movies in the on-going saga are going to be a real treat. Make mine Marvel!", "Frankly,just an action sci-if movie without any deeper things.\nWe need to see more than explosions and unserious jokes.\nPlease learn some from DC.", "This movie is a work of art, compilation of imaginations & most probably a beautiful presentation of values & emotions..", "Avengers Infinity war Ensembles an all star cast once again and they pulled all the stops out of the bag with this one. Unfortunately though i could not sit and enjoy this film as much as i had of liked to because people were up and walking around every 2 minutes and this really annoyed me.  all that being said the film was great and i can't wait to see where the directors go with the next film. There is also a post-credit scene at the end of the movie involving Shield and Captain Marvel", "Simply an amazing movie. Devastating, but amazing. It was exciting all the way through with new things happening. Wasn't hard to keep up and the plot was great. The entire movie had a theme of awesomeness.", "I went to this movie looking forward to the unusual, \"i know what to expect\". I was armed with snacks, drinks, chocolate, clean shaven, settled. The movie, trailers and ads were 3 hours (the movie is roughly 2.5 hrs), i felt like i had only been watching for 30 minutes, the food untouched, drink untouched and when i left, my body and soul had been taken on a journey aboard the Event Horizon, through a vortex that threw my mind and body thought a vortex of unimaginable shock and turmoil. I have not had a film take me on a journey such as this for so long, i dont even remember what movie it was, our heroes are human, they are not are not just super, they are like us, they have special abilities that we can see, but frailties that are hidden, but not anymore.  I felt with them, went through their hardships with them, saw their inner demons face to face and stood against those demons side by side with them. We saw them for real, like us in many ways, but with the additional bonus of special abilities.  I left part broken, part of me was left behind in that theatre, all of me wanted to straight away find out when the sequel was, if you tell me there is non, then a void will exist in me for a long time.  Yes, it is only a movie, but it has been directed to show them as not Gods above us all the time, separate from us, somewhere else, as heroes who are elsewhere, this time we saw and felt them amongst us, we felt all their pain and suffering, this time, we were all in the experience together.  You will go and watch an Avengers movie you will know you have left having watched something else, something better, something that grabs you around the throat, tosses you around and then kicks you before your head has stopped spinning, then for good measure, when you think there can be no more, you are right, there is no more, now, like millions of others after watching this movie, i wait quietly for someone to tell me when the saga continues. My only prayer is that they don't keep me waiting too long... For all Avengers and super heroes fans, watch this movie, dont miss it, but be prepared to be taken down a path laid with thorns...", "Last night I went to the cinema to watch \"Infinity War\" and I wasn't thrilled at all. I'm aware that it's partly my fault, but anyway I think it's extremely overrated. Seen by itself, the film is completely meaningless, because this is not a stand-alone film, but the grand finale of all Marvel films that precede it. So, it's not just recommended that you have seen most of Marvel films before, but it's absolutely necessary that you have seen them all and that they are fresh in your memory. I watched most of Marvel films, but some of them I skipped, and many of those I did see I saw too long ago to remember them, so \"Infinity War\" left me with the impression of a bunch of amazingly shot, but empty action scenes, without the story that gives this action a meaning. It's like if you watched the last hour of \"The Return of the King\", without previously watching the rest of the trilogy or reading \"The Lord of the Rings\" ever before. Most movies have a part that introduces you to characters, then introduces them into a story, then develops and elaborates the story, and ultimately takes you through the blow-away finale. This whole movie is one huge finale, while all the other elements that you need to experience this finale right way need to be found in other Marvel films. Each of the previous films brings new characters, introduces you to them and connects them to the characters from the previous films, builds their mutual relationships and portrays small parts of the big picture, and then \"Infinity War\" puts all these characters together and, assuming you already know who they are, what their relationships are and what was happening in their individual stories, it immediately cast you right into two and a half hour of action madness, without any characterization and explanations, and with a minimum of the story that serves just to separate the action scenes. Marvel films are a literally series in which the episodes are somewhat independent, and this is the last episode, and do not even try to watch it if you didn't follow entire series. Although visually excellent, to me \"Infinity War\" was terribly confusing and even boring, and I will refrain from rating it until I see all the movies that precede him, and then repeat it with good background.", "There were too many characters and most were unneeded like Ernie the giant fish frog and batman and pewdiepie and Freddie Mercury and the entire football team of North Korea, would recommend 734 pinapples out of 346 tomato's", "Thanos is one of the best characters in the mcu and the russo brothers have done a perfect work.", "I hope this was the last Marvel movie, at least last one concerning this story continuum. If it is not, i will be disappointed. Infinity War has good, memorable ending. If it is spoiled by future movies with the help of some \"gotcha-trick\", this movie will not stand a classic. If it is left as-is now, it will stand as a cult classic for generations. Sadly we all know how this will go.  The movie itself suffers from basic action-hero-clichees. Why not try to gang the villain with a planetful of groots, every possible hero and the army? Why send a couple of ordinary heroes against something that is already master of the universe? It makes no sense. Also, the narrative suffers from too many places and persons until things move forward after an hour or so.  Extra star for good villain. Though Thanos is very boring, just purple mass of meat with a 80s style boxing glove, his intentions and backrounds are opened up well and he has some soul. Even more than some of the heroes.", "There;s nothing to say about it exept wow. I'm not giving any spoilers, just wow.", "Yes, there is a \"but\" to come but onto the film first.  Right from the start you can feel the quality and intuitiveness of those at the helm. For me, that means close-ups, pans, zoom-outs and changes the POV of the action without the audience being aware of it. Every little eye-brow raise, head tilt and expression is intended and adds an unspoken aspect of the dialogue. It is this deft touch and the quality of the storyline that sets MCU adaptations apart from the rest, well except for the stony, lock-jawed DareDevil but thank Galactus, Affleck has joined DC alongside Mr Cheesy himself, Henry Edsel (pun intended). If losing Wolverine was painful, the losses in this quest is gut-wrenching and it occurs not with a struggle to the death but a passive whimper. It reminds of the Matrix where the players simply fall in a lifeless heap as they are each unplugged. Without giving too much away, the use of a cliche to enable part 2 is where it loses me. Star Lord's plan worked and would have won the day but he couldn't wait another microsecond to ask about Gamora. Really, the first time they actually have an advantage and the fate of the universe in the balance, he goes ape and demands an answer immediately thus letting Thanos escape. Thor too could have ended Thanos but for some inexplicable reason, he too stops short. Last but not least, Dr Strange could have used anthem time stone the way he stopped an evil as powerful as Thanos, Dormammu, in his own biopic but somehow that didn't occur to him this time. How annoying. As much I enjoyed the movie, plots are still important and have some respect for your fans. If they just wanted action for action's sake, they would have watched the Justice League or Transformers.

This movie makes an impact on you that will last for some time. After a very long time, something extra-ordinary to watch. I really felt the fear of Thanos that means how perfectly this character is developed. \nExcellent Stuff and a Must Watch!", "Wow just shocking and blow my mind its amazing movie", "Infinity War deserves to be one of the best Marvel movie to have come out, if not the best. It truly combines all characters into a single story telling which is well laid out and gives every character a chance to shine. Without going into the story and spoilers, I will highlight the pros and cons of the movie  Pros: \nThanos - after a decade of waiting we get to see him and he does not disappoint at all Characters - most of the characters are in the film except of Hawk eye (whom I never liked) and AntMan. Each character gets good screen time especially Thor and Iron man and surprisingly Spider-Man too Story - story is not so complex and continues where Thor 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 and CA Civil War ended. You will easily follow it if you can stay up for two and half hour  Cons \nThanos - yes that is true. There is no doubt he did an amazing job but his portrayal wasn't all that. I wished to see him in his full armor suit but he was bare head. Also he's supposed to be strong overall but movie seems to show the infinity stone makes him stronger Missing characters- AntMan was missing and I have no idea why. No Captain Marvel cameo  End credit - there are end credit scene but you have to wait 15 mins for it after entire credit roll out and the scene is barely 20 sec Ending - by the time movie finish you will know this is just the beginning. The entire movie was focus on Thanos collecting the infinity stone. What he is going to do with it is probably in the next infinity War  Climax - this was the let down for me. First the main fight takes place in an open ground of Wakanda. Second so many creatures took most of the screen time that Thanos himself comes at the end and the fight is very small. There was no scene at the end where all avengers jump on him to fight him (beside the scene at Titan where Ironman Spider-Man and doctor strange all fight him at once which was a better scene than final battle). This was a major let down also because the final scene was on open ground and not in the main city. Once one small scene in the beginning was shot in NYC which was pretty small and quick.  Scenes - some of the scene in trailer were not in the film it could be they are part of Infinity War II since they shot both films together  Hulk - no hulk smashing this time since Bruce banner had trouble becoming a hulk he is given a hulk buster armor  Overall the movie scores 8/10 on my scale and I hope the next part fills in the gap that were missed in Infinity War", "GRADE: B  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A superhero movie with a puny and weak plot and non-stop action. JIM'S REVIEW: Superheroes. They come in all shapes and sizes, with varying super powers and enough attitude and skill to fight against evil and protect mankind. More importantly, they rake in millions at the box office. The DC Comics and Marvel universe have taken over the movie business and offer critic-proof blockbuster after blockbuster for the insatiable moviegoing public. But perhaps my favorite crusader comes from neither source. He's a little big man by the name of Buzz Lightyear whose famous catch phrase and mantra was...\"To infinity and beyond\". That classic line may be over two decades old, but this toy oracle saw the future of cinema back in the mid-nineties. Which leads us to the 18th film from the Marvel Studios series, Avengers: Infinity War, the latest pop entertainment from one of the most successful and profitable franchise in cinema history.  In this installment, we discover that there has been a rift among superheroes. There is Team Ironman and his loyal crew of major and minor characters (Thor, Spiderman, The Hulk, Doctor Strange) versus Team Captain America and his colorful line-up of rogue groupies (Black Widow, Vision, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, White Wolf, Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Falcon), plus the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Lots and lots of superheroes with little time to spare for deeper character development but lots of time for CGI and action stunts. Yet what will unite them all? Why, of course, a truly bad villain, namely Thanos, who wants all six of the magical infinity stones in his possession in order to dominate the world! (Maybe, collecting trading cards of all of the assembled superheroes might have been a more challenging goal for our conflicted outlaw.) Yes, the plot is puny and weak, but the consequences to stop this megalomaniac are of the life and death variety. So all you need to know is that the battle lines have been drawn over the prized McGuffin, with one battle scene leading to the next for maximum enjoyment. ACTION is in not in short supply, even if logic and high drama take a backseat to the frequent combat sequences.  Anthony and Joe Russo ably direct and keep the pace at warp speed lest they disappoint their youthful target audience. A screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely juggles the misadventures on the different planetary destinations with varied results, some are simply more interesting than others. To its credit, it establishes many likable quirky characters and their camaraderie is infectious due to the actors' personal stamps on their recognizable roles. Yet the movie has a hard time spreading its narrative with a balance of equal screen time and does little to advance the development of some central characters and their interrelationships. Too often the numerous sub-plots and mini-expeditions with such a large ensemble wears thin. Dialog has some clever humorous retorts but rarely aspires to any real poignancy or gravitas.  The gangs all here, with an all-star ensemble that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Bossman, and in lesser roles: Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Benicio del Toro, and others too numerous to name. Josh Brolin effectively plays the evil Thanos and creates a strong adversary who allows power to corrupt his soul. The CGI is impressive throughout. Less effective is the editing and handling of transitions. At times, the well staged combat scenes intercut some of the action. Too much planet hopping interrupts the overall flow and gives the film an episodic vibe...the sum of the parts never making a very cohesive whole. Yes, there is much to hold one spellbound with its big budget cast of thousands approach and the film's fine production values, but all the rigmarole and commotion almost exhausts the moviegoer rather than enthralls. One eagerly awaits for the fractured teams of heroes to meld into an unstoppable force, but it never truly materializes and the cliffhanger ending is far from satisfying. This long and epic film literally comes to a stop with no clear denouncement, taking Mr. Lightyear's phrase and deciding not to settle anything soon, just looking beyond...to the next installment, with no end in sight. In Avengers: Infinity War, the war rages on and on...and the Marvel franchise lives long and prospers...to infinity.", "This movie is really good not better then the winter soldier or black panther and not the best marvel movie..but it does have the best marvel villain to date and a really good story.

They flow well, I feel like there isn't a huge gap in the story and everything makes sense.

I always watched Marvel Movies in the same childlike glee I once had at a younger age, excited for the action and comedy but never really overly afraid or anxious of the outcome. More often than not, super hero movies end the way you expect them to, not much trepidation is required, and with Marvel's formula of mirroring what makes a villain I just couldn't ever feel the edge of my seat. This movie however, blew all that out the water. Not not only did they manage to create a monster I can sympathise with and at times agree with, they conjured up the perfect anti-hero. This is the film where Marvel put on it's big boy pants and, as a self proclaimed DC lover, it beats every super hero movie out there. In one word, shocking. Just...shocking.", "The movie is an 8.5/10 in my review but 9/10 on the IMDB scale. I watched it twice to make sure I didn't miss anything. It deserves a high score because of the work shown and because of how the characters finally connected. I cant stress enough how phenomenal the character interactions were. Thor stole this movie! It doesnt get that perfect score because its hard to believe there were consequence in this movie. Supposedly we were going to see them. Its also hrad to believe that because they announced a bunch of sequels like black panther 2 and spider man 2, and doctor strange 2...( Not marvels fault...) the impact of the final scene did not have an impact because I knew this. Then again this is the style of sci fi/comics ( no one ever stays dead ). Secondly there was an odd habit of off screen character jumping into screen out of nowhere. That got old quick..matter of fact it starts when hulk jumped into screen in the first five minutes..how does the hulk hide in plain sight. Its hulk..strongest there is...The effect didnt ruin the movie but got old quick.... The biggest take away : IMAX. Like I said I saw it twice. The first theater had high quality visual and sound ( not IMAX ). Colors were great and the sound was so crisp I could hear the lines that Thanos whispered and the explosions and effects were felt.\nThe second theater was just standard viewing and the colors were a just a tad less vibrant. And I felt like the screen shrunk just inches in what could be shown. So next movie I will see in IMAX.", "Epic in every sense of the world a gigantic achievement in history of cinema !!", "I saw the movie on Friday. Needed a couple days to digest. I have read most of the reviews to see what people really thought of it. I will start with this, those who scored it low are mainly not fans of Marvel. They have no vested interest in any of the characters. It's too much for them because it's a slew of faceless characters. They are looking for something that isn't there...Drama, speak to world issues (Black Panther), Women's equality (Wonder Woman, The Last Jedi). This movie isn't that. It was written for the fans who have watched and waited. These are characters that have lived for years in comic books. Sorry if you don't like them. We understand our characters. We understand the history and the whats, whys and hows of their storylines here. It means something to us. We are invested. If you read their reviews you will see they complain about something they don't understand that is clear to the rest of us.  Now I will say that some fans were disappointed. I can appreciate that. Not everyone gets what they are looking for. It's not perfect but it's darn entertaining. If you really want to know if the movie is worth watching, read the higher rated reviews. Sometimes the fans can be the most critical...especially after waiting 10 years for this. How bad can a movie be that has the audience jumping to its feet and cheering? Before the ending.", "Its everything you but its more than that can eyes can see absorb !!!!!!", "Its everything you want but its more than you thinks meets the eye", "Lately I have lost my interest in superhero stuff. It is so much that I would not spend my well earned bucks on them. However this experience was different. I went to see the movie with the number of positive reviews coming up. I however dint saw any trailers but came to knew few spoilers. I am happy that still it went positively for me. Tone, Script & Story: The story runs around Thanos who maintains balance of universe and kills in the process - going against Avengers (superheroes of Marvel universe). It was nice to see story constructed around Doctor Strange with his powers and now further development. It would be nice to see what magical world of Dr. Strange will mean to Tony(the man with knowledge) in coming sequel . I was however disappointed in construction of story around Bruce, he is no more winning and now he even can't get his other side out which is totally opposite to what we saw in last movie. To add further, the humor that goes on during various scenes in all such movies is a treat in itself. The end that we see in this movie, I don't know if it make sense to comic readers. For me it is a brain work that I think will get enlightened in the sequel. Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Special effects come with a disadvantage in cinematography. For me contrast was not up to the mark. The constructed characters and scenes were however best in that genre. Final Verdict: Well justified with unpredictable plot, keeping you on your toes. Worth your penny.", "Can you f$@ing mention a movie with 40+ characters yet still managing to succeed? Its infinity war. To the stupid haters out there. Why don't you direct a movie with 40+ characters in it? Let's see if you can do it. This is what makes you think that this movie is a complete masterpiece. A unique villain is a villain who thinks what they're doing I'm their perspective is the right thing just like what vulture and warmonger are.", "It is a must see of this year, but I sincerely hope the 2nd part is a lot better.\nThe movie ends about how you expected it to end keeping in mid it's actually a two part'er. But for how many superheroes appear on screen they are actually pretty well represented.\nRobert Downing Jr. (Iron Man) steals all the scenes that he is in and the Vision is the most useless member (for an android with an infinity stone in him he gets his butt kicked a lot, Black-widow beats up more bad guys than him).\nWould have liked the movie to be a good 40 minutes longer (lets hope for an extended edition).", "I'm really mixed to positive on this one. It's hard to explain my feelings about the movie without spoiling it, so I'll say this: the things that this movie does well, it does it REALLY well. Thanos was great as villain (his motives, not so much), the action scenes were good, I liked most of the character interactions, there were some emotional scenes that were done well, and a few things will transpire that you won't see coming, which was very exciting. After Thor's last atrocious solo outing (Ragnarok), I didn't really care much for his character but this time around, the Russo's brought the thunder (pun intended); he was my favorite of all the Avengers in this film (even though there were some still some residual Ragnarok traits, I'm willing to forgive them). The things that it does bad, it does REALLY bad. A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Towards the middle of the film, the scenes seemed to kind of jump all over the place but that's just a small nitpick on my part. Certain characters were handled in a way that really bothered me, but I can't divulge on that point without spoilers. Lastly, the ending just fell flat for me; I understand what they were trying to do with the ending and it DID work to some degree, but for everything that happened in the movie and for it to end the way it did...it just didn't sit well with me. Overall, I thought the movie was good...the Russo Brothers are excellent directors (Winter Soldier is still, by far, my favorite MCU film) and I'm ready to see what they have in store for Avengers 4!!! 3.5/5 Stars", "Everything has been building up to this. Every hero has been on screen, had his action, made his jokes. Considering that, for the heroes this movie doesn't offer much besides repeating tricks. What this movies does offer, is the breathtaking performance of Josh Brolin's Thanos. Not unlike the comic Thanos Quest, this movie is about Thanos manipulating his way into godlike power, until his power is cemented enough to put himself amidst the action. Besides being a brilliant, tactical, philosophical being, Thanos is also in pain because of the terrible choices he has to make. This movie is not just about Thanos' battle against the heroes, but the internal quest he has to make, to fullfill a destiny. That's why it's easy to forgive this movie for the lack of character development among the heroes. the relation between Wanda and Vision, Wakanda, the motivations of the Children of Thanos etc. Everything and everyone is little more than a stepping stone for Thanos. But with a character so well written, Thanos deserves nothing less.", "Overall a very good movie ...despite the fact that it is a big movie it doesnt bore you..nonetheless it excites you scene after seen ...BUT thats all cause of the tension of the moment...when you get out of the cinema and start thinking about the movie there some questionmarks with the biggest one being the ending...for example a minor question mark is the ''hulk'' ...why would you not show us in this movie the great clash between these 2 ''titans''...at the comics thanos is constantly avoiding conflicts with hulk ...why would you make hulk seem so afraid in this movie...now about the ending...it's really really nice to see some characters dying ...especially the way they died in this movie cause it keeps the agony levels really high..another BUT coming ..BUT why would you kill characters that they already have confirmed or at least 90% confirmed sequels..we already know that there will be a spiderman 2 and gotg 3(also black panther doctor strange are likely to have sequels if not surely)...which means we already know that none of these characters will remain dead...i believe that the movie would be much much better if other heroes died in the end...it had great action and emotional scenes but the ending was poor...(sorry for any grammar mistakes or any mistakes in general)", "When was the last time you really wanted something? Now when you've pictured that moment in your mind; how much did you fight for it? Whatever that moment is for you, wether if it's a physical or mental. You pushed yourself through it, wether you succeeded or lost, you still fought for what you wanted. From the words of wise Mr. C; -\"I don't need anything. I want.\" That is the power that we as humans inhabit, what strive us forward. You fight for what you want, because you, alone believe that something should change. Our beliefs are our own personal superpower. Because no matter how hard the obstacle is. If you want to succeed. You will. If you don't believe me, read a book. This world was built by believers. By wanters. The mad Titan Thanos and the world's mightiest heroes themselves believe in this philosophy. The fundamental difference between these people are ideologies. And now here we are. Avengers: Infinity War. Believers against one powerful, unstoppable believer. Rejoice. This is a superhero movie, that feels like a film. A well-crafted, emotionally resonant film that looks great, sounds great, acted great and has genuine thrills that will shock some. But entertain everyone. How much depends on how much you let yourself.", "Just go watch it if you don't like it don't talk to me", "Put it this way. This movie was so awesome. Everything was awesome. If you say there are flaws, then they are awesome flaws. This is the King of all movies.", "Infinity War does a truly amazing job of stuffing as many superheroes into a single movie as possible and keeping track of most of them. Sure, some get lost in the shuffle, little more than cameos, but a remarkable number are given emotional depth, which makes it light years ahead of the overrated first Avengers movie, in which the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts designed to support the action. The movie is witty, likable, and engaging, establishing huge odds and placing it's full bet on crazy, leave-no-man-behind heroism. It goes on a little long, and towards the end the action becomes a little bombastic, but overall it's tremendous fun. The movie also, like The Empire Strikes back, ends in the middle. I really hate that. I also feel it telegraphs the next movie. I mean, you really can't engage in such wholesale slaughter without the assumption that in spite of all odds something will be done, and this blunts the emotional impact of the whole thing. Is the resolution to this movie really so elaborate that it requires it's own movie? Couldn't the bloat and some of the nonsensical plot extenders (like a blindingly stupid and unlikely moment from Starlord) have been removed to make a single zippy film? Probably, but that's not what happened. Alas.", "I absolutely liked it. Superheroes especially Marvel I can only take in smaller doses, but when we get all those superheros in this film it is so Epic. On their own they can often drag out. DC Batman/Superman/Dredd however I am more inclined until they don't combine well, because they are stand alone, and any justice league seemingly only really stole from Marvel.  I admit this film is gonna be marmite to some, love/hate possibly due to continuity. But it's worth it unless they predictably Disney next. There should be a price. Look at our World. Otherwise I might stew. As far as the current trilogy so far, it's very hard for me too pick a winner between the first and the 3rd? The first started it and was a great film, the 3rd however you must watch and make that marmite opinion. Forget the second I didn't like it, many reasons, but that's a separate review. Infinity War certainly lives up too its hype, it is so fresh and enjoyable, they didn't look stupid like all stand around jacking each other off in those other superhero movies where they all do a line dance, singing like a bad music video. It had enough clever one-liners, comedy not too impact its telling, but enough humor for it to also be a hoot. And its visuals, choreography, and story are masterful.  Thank you for this addition. It was amazing, and a favorite.", "Great story telling amazing visual effects\nThe best comicbook movie ever made\nEven better than the dark knight", "I thought this was a 9/10 but gave it 10 stars to counter the 1/10 from all the moronic DC fanboys. They're not even hiding it well either. Go read all the 1/10 reviews and see how many at some point make a remark about \"how bad it is and it's the sort of thing those marvel fans enjoy\" or similar. They slip up every time.  So blatantly obvious. Go back to your dire movies and maybe get out of your mother's basements once in a while.", "What started as a risky gamble from Marvel Studios in 2008 with \"Iron Man\" has turned into a 10-year journey of character development, adventurous stories, and the most lucrative film franchise of all-time. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has been building to a gargantuan culmination for a decade, and that pinnacle is Avengers: Infinity War (IW), a generational milestone in filmmaking, an ultimate assembly of more-than-established characters, one of the greatest superhero films - one of the greatest action/fantasy films in history. For the first time in one of its films, Marvel Studios thrusts its primary villain to the forefront, as the Mad Titan Thanos, the definitive big-bad of the MCU, takes center stage, and in doing so, cements himself as one of the greatest comic book-film villains ever to grace the screen. Thanos has a wickedly sadistic goal, to eradicate half of life in the universe using the six Infinity Stones, which have been meticulously placed throughout the course of the MCU's history. Yet, his motives are understandable in a horrible way, he has the capacity to love and care, and it gives something to latch onto the character besides him being a psychopath for psychopaths' sake. His sacrifice of Gamora is the definition of his complexity, it's an emotionally taxing scene and one of the film's best. The big purple baddie is given the most screen time of any character, he's developed properly and given immense power over our main heroes, creating a massively intimidating villain who presents very threating stakes. To top it off, actor Josh Brolin is simply brilliant in his motion capture role, and Marvel made sure to put the finest details into making Thanos look believable, not making the same mistake Warner Bros. did with Justice League's Steppenwolf monstrosity. Infinity War's narrative isn't afraid to demand your respect right out of the gate, setting the tragically dark tone by showcasing its Everest-level stakes with the deaths of long-standing franchise characters Loki and Heimdall. Not to mention Thanos gives Hulk, the strongest character we've known in the MCU thus far, the beating of his life to solidify the fact that IW, Thanos and his Children mean business. The heavier tone echoes through the 149 min runtime; we see beloved heroes desperately fighting to survive Thanos' galactic onslaught, plot twists that barely allow you stay in your seat, chillingly gripping dialogue and an ending so Earth-shattering it would break the Richter scale. The decision to have Thanos win (albeit temporarily), to kill off numerous fan favorite characters in the blink of an eye, it's a finale like no other, a gut punch of the highest level. And even though many of the deceased characters will return, their deaths still leave an immediate impact, and a message that Marvel isn't always a Saturday morning cartoon. Even the end-credits don't roll with a glorious artistic montage as heroic music booms in the background. Here, it's somber string instruments with black and white text. After 2017 was packed with comedic-heavy Marvel entries, it was wonderfully refreshing to see IW take itself as seriously as a comic book story of this magnitude could. Fitting the crazed Mad Titan into a compact story with over two-dozen other main characters seems like an impossible task. Alas, the masterful vision from directors Joe and Anthony Russo, (already praised for creating arguably the previous two best films in the MCU with \"The Winter Solider\" and \"Civil War\") along with the magnificent lettering of lead writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, create a story on a scale never before seen in cinema, making it as well-paced and compact as possible without creating a 4 hour film (which many fans, myself included would love) and then tying a pretty ribbon on top. What allows Markus and McFeely to have the confidence to create such a jam-packed film? The pure notion that there is a 10-year foundation of profound character development to build onto. A story of this size could never work if it didn't have beyond-established characters to work with, which is how new ones are able to be introduced in this film as well. That includes Thanos and his four Children, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glave and Obsidian Stane, all who add tremendous layers of depth to the antagonistic side, none more than Maw, who is often a scene stealer. Seeing all these characters in the same film is unbelievable, truly. And what's more is that every distinct trait found in every character is fleshed out and often creates down right epic or hilarious moments. Going off an earlier point, while the tone of IW is without a doubt more mature and gritty, there's a presence of humor that rivals the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok. And since those films' characters both can be found here, along with several more, IW becomes one of the funniest movies in the MCU. Along with heroic moments and entrances that just make you want to stand up and cheer, it's a perfect supplement to prevent the film from being a in a constant state of depression, making all the characters as enjoyable to watch as ever. If you want blockbuster action, look no further. Infinity War flexes its action-muscles bigger than Hulk's to display ridiculously entertaining action sequences. The combination of heroes never before seen on the big screen together paves way for grand flashes of next-level action, it's dazzling to see the likes of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man and the Guardians all take on Thanos while Black Panther and company fortify the glorious city of Wakanda from an invasion to retrieve the Mind Stone. A sweeping score from Alan Silvestri (The Avengers) stands out and adds to the drama. Its majestic mayhem, fueled by stunning VFX, moving set pieces and captivating atmosphere, all gelling together to form an enthralling superhero spectacle.  To be short but sweet, the acting department of every single character is unparalleled in today's superhero genre. There's simply too many names to list off, but MCU icon Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Chris Hemsworth's new take on Thor, Zoe Saldana as Gamora and of course, again, Josh Brolin as Thanos are the noteworthy standouts. Every character has its defined actor, the chemistry flows like a fine wine as the acting gives life to IW's superb story. The last decade of Marvel movies has brought incalculable joy to millions of fans across the globe. It's given us characters to relate to, to root for and to cherish. It's perfected \"the Marvel formula\", a recipe that no other studio has yet to replicate, pumping out one gold star after the next, building a connected film franchise like none other. And now, it's given us Infinity War, the epic crowning achievement of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  10/10", "Just.... wow.

With the death of Loki, Gamora and Vision it does make you sad but the ending has a special tear. At the end it kills some of your favorite characters such as Groot, Spider-Man, Star-Lord and many others. The concept is that Thanos (Josh Brolin) needs to collect all the Infinity Stones that have been spread across the galaxy for the last 10 years of the MCU. Big guy Josh Brolin needs to collecct all of the infinity stones and snap his fingers to end the world. And this is exactly what he does , he snaps his fingers and that's how the ending kills people.

That being said, it is a good movie with plenty of action, some humor, and dazzling looks. Bringing all the various Comic book heroes of the Marvel Universe together is a spectacular way.

When Spider-Man died, I honestly haven't cried that much since I saw Interstellar.  Lastly, I have to applaud the cast and crew for keeping literally everything about the movie under wraps.

I love big popcorn movies & comic book movies & I've loved nearly all the MCU flicks that I've seen & Infinity War is probably my favourite of the Avengers films & one of the best Marvel has made.\nThe cinematography is gorgeous & the music theatrical & exciting & i loved having the Guardians of the galaxy back here & of course the hilarious Thor steals the show alot with his hilarious attitude & kick-ass fighting, i love that dude but all the characters do get a great scene or more to do their stuff. A fantastic special effects extravaganza & an instant fantasy action Classic!!!", "One of the films that finishes with villain's win. Overall, very interesting.", "This movie definitely does not disappoint. Marvel in general always does such a good job and has the perfect balance between action and storytelling. I have a strong connection to every character in this series and thats a very special thing to have for an action movie.", "Amazing. An exceptional piece of superhero cinema. Gives me chills every time.", "Movie is the best movie I've seen..What I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers.The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre.The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling.\nAnd i love this movie and superheros..", "It's funny how I thought it was a disgrace of a film when my friend took me to the theatre to see it, but after a few years it still sticks because of how Thanos is projected as villain and slowly I'm starting to wonder if he is. I wonder if - would this story be told again in a few decades - he would be a hero for taking on such a task.", "This is the first part of the new Avengers movie. It's the first part of two. It's called the \"Infinity War\", and a good title for the movie. In this movie, the team of Avengers have to take on a formidable supervillain called Thanos from taking over the universe and destroying everything. Thanos is one of the strongest and powerful supervillains in the universe, and the Avengers have their work cut-out even as a group/unit. In this movie, you get to see many of your superheroes such as Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man and Captain America. They all have to take on this \"mad man\" from Titan, and save the world. What I did like about \"The Mad Titan\" (Thanos) was his costume. I thought that was cool. I like it when he wears that helmet - he looks better. Can't believe how strong Thanos is, and it takes that many superheroes to defeat him. That's why Thanos is known as a supervillain - a special kind of villain. It takes a team of Avengers to defeat such enemies. I thought the movie was good - I liked it. It's an adventure movie with a lot of action. It's also an Avengers movie, so I don't know how you can not like it. The movie was long, but that's a good thing since it's an Avengers movie, and it allows the story to develop, and this is what this movie does. The only thing I didn't like is that you don't get to see other superheroes in this movie such as the Fantastic 4 and X-Men. Where were they? Hope you get what I mean. Earth has a lot of superheroes...", "Go to the cinema to see the action special effects are all great. I personally think it's pretty good, the scene when all the heroes came out together is very shocking, and there are tears in the middle.", "Not to mention what the plot of the next movie will be, but for this avengers 3, there is no villain, only justice, no villain, only hero!", "In terms of content, the third part feels rather void for strangers to the genre. Because all in all, compared to the first two parts, there is simply more action, more superheroes and even more aggravation towards the unforeseeable end. But it's great to see the Avengers getting more and more involved in the story from part to part. In this third part it gets serious. Because the villain is attacking the earth. Here too, new heroes are added, such as Spiderman and Doctor Strange. The technical effects in this part are extremely overwhelming and well done. Camera, sound and music result in a uniform dance. The film captivates you and sprints from one action sequence to the next. Only the final remains, and with it the last part of the Avengers.", "It's beyond my expectation. Some emotional climax comes from villains. It's sad to watch the film. It reminds me of the ghost story of the saint fighter I chased when I was a child. When one gold saint fighter died.", "It's nice seeing a superhero movie where the heroes don't win in the end. Was expecting to be bored but enjoyed it throughout. Long drawn out action that stays fresh throughout. 4/5.", "Finally watched this film as well. I was sad at the end seeing some of the Avengers, or Marvel characters, disappear in ashes. Another sad part was seeing some dead. The beginning was intense! Shows how strong the villain was! Definitely worth watching! You will be MIND-BLOWN!", "If you don't like the movie, it means he's not prepared for you, and the final chapter of the story is for those who have read it.Thank you, Marvel; thank you, my 11 years are complete, really complete. I love you.", "The story is very amzing.I love it.In the fact,my friends also love it.", "Aside from the usual spectacular action scenes, this film was beautifully emotional and hard on the soul of fans that have followed the entire saga. How Black Panther got a best picture nod over this one is truly beyond me.", "Is there such a good movie seriously I thought these movies were just a myth but here it is. I will not give spoilers just saying that every movie fan should watch it.", "This movie really has it all on a grandiose scale!\nEmotion, struggle, humour and phenomenal team work shines in all the right places. In one such way this film is outstanding is in the character development. Mainly the relationships between: Thor & Loki, Thanos, Gamora & Nebula, Tony & Peter Another place that this film excels at is the tension and intensity of the situation at hand aka Thanos and his army wreaking havok all over Earth and surrounding planets. We learn that Thanos' motivations are pretty intriguing and that he truly believes he's doing the right thing in his own mind despite his adopted daughters telling him otherwise. His long-saught, desperation leads him to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to gain all of the six infinity stones. Sacrificing his own adopted daughter. This scene was a heartwrencher and so was Loki's devastating demise. Other extremely tense situations were when Gamora begged Quill to end her life so that Thanos would be unable to obtain crucial information about where to and how to retrieve the remaining stones. Quill, in tears respected her wish despite being in love with her and shot. Only to have bubbles come out of the gun thanks to Thanos. The two were in devastation as their arranged plan did not work out. The ending battle was also full-on epic and emotional as various characters vanished into dust and Wanda had to kill the love of her life, Vision. This film is still a pinnacle of all superhero movies to date (alongside Endgame) and shall be respected well on into the future. :)", "Yes I prefer this movie and all characters played good", "Truly epic, the direction of the movie, the directing of the movie, the writing, the acting, the action, Josh Brolin as thanos, it's all amazing, however there are certain aspects of the movie that I did not like, but they are spoilers, so I won't be saying what it is.", "One of the best films, both visually and in terms of story line, to come out in a long time", "One of the best films, both visually and in terms of story line, to come out in a very long time", "This movie is epic, it's an experience, but it just didn't get a lot out of me. First of all, you have got to admire what the Russo brothers were going for with this, the directing of this film is flawless. The writing and the acting in this movie is just fantastic, in my opinion the best portrayal of this movie, is Robert Downy Jr. as Tony Stark/ Iron Man, he had the best part of the character development in this movie. But in a close second comes Josh Brolin as Thanos, and thanos is the definition of what a movie villain should be, he was menacing, his motivation is excellent, you don't know what he was going to do next, thanos just puts me on the edge of my seat, and the something that he actually has where a lot of other movie villains don't, is having an actual good purpose for what he is trying to achieve, I don't see that in most movie villains nowadays. The comedy is great in this movie, if it's a marvel movie, you are definitely going to laugh a whole lot. The cinematography is great, I could see what's happening throughout the entire movie. I liked the action, but there were times where the action didn't get a lot out of me, and those times felt like the action was bland, thankfully, it's not that many. There were certain aspects of the movie that bothered me, and one of them was hulk. He barely showed up in this movie, and I wanted a lot of hulk scenes in this film, and that really upsetted me off. There were very few characters in this movie that just felt like they had no purpose of being in this movie.\nConclusion: Avengers Infinity War is definitely an experience, but it didn't get a whole lot out of me and certain aspects of the movie just didn't feel right in my opinion. But, the movie has a lot of charm, and is definitely a fun time watching.", "Avengers Infinity War was perfectly balanced as all things should be. But literally this picture is visually a masterpiece without doubt. Character arcs was well developt and the story/plot was amazingly good leaving us with shocking but outstanding cliffhanger. Russo Brother have once again accomplished a near impossible task to jam-pack dozens of superheroes into a 2hr40min film without any flaws. The humour was suprisngly on point and balanced the action and emotion. Overall this was a fitting predecessor for Avengers 4.", "I'm gonna keep this short because you've heard this everywhere, but Avengers: Infinity War is amazing. Probably my favorite film out of the MCU. With the amount of characters in this film the Russo Brothers had to juggle, it's astonishing this movie worked. Every character felt like they were apart of the movie in a good enough way, there was a perfect balance of screen time. And they managed to write Thanos as one of the best villains EVER. Visual effects are perfect, I mean what else do you want. This movie also had a whole lot of hype around it and it was one of my most hyped movies of all time. Infinity war gets a 10/10", "...a great mashup of genres, some hilarious moments, creative action, a fantastic arc for the mad Titan Thanos, and a brilliant concoction of bringing together all the disparate threads generated over however many filmmakers and agendas over however many years. It's certainly a film that requires previous knowledge and it's certainly the first of two films but on a second watch the film breathes and its juggling of tones and steady hand under the Russo's is very clear. It's an event film and is in a class amongst the best we have these days. I was overly critical the first time but this time I enjoyed it for exactly what it was and appreciated its flow and clarity and quality. It's clever and fun and certainly a benchmark.", "I keep on repeating the movie over and over again. The movie will leave you in happy mood and emotional as well", "One of my best experience in a cinema! A lot of action, great characters, my favorite superheroes movie.\nI loved Dr.Strange and Iron Man interaction, the guardians of the galaxy are always funny and Captain America was great.\nThanos was the best part of the movie, THE villain of the MCU.", "Having known exactly what happened at the end of this movie, I was uncertain for a while about watching it because I figured it wouldn't have the same 'wow' effect on me like it did on all the movie-goers that went in not having a clue about what was in store for them.\nThankfully, though, I had forgotten a couple crucial details, so was still awed by the whole thing.\nIt has a solid and VERY well-written plot that conveys a perfect balance between dark and light i.e. - manages to convey it's heavy and serious plot with the perfect amount of humour, which is enough to keep it from becoming too depressing and not too much that it can be accused of not taking itself too seriously.\nThe acting is solid - everyone steps up their game and really gets you involved in their stories and the main story.\nI listened to this at night, and so as not to disturb the rest of my family, I had the sound down very low, so I couldn't hear the musical score very well, but the little bit I did catch was haunting, beautiful and evoked many emotions, so I'm fully intending to sit down at some point very soon and rewatch it with sound.\nThe climax is awesome - very tense, emotional, and just shocking. As I mentioned earlier, I had forgotten a couple crucial (VERY crucial) details, so when I watched it, it made me just as shocked and just as horrified at particular scenes as the characters.\nAnd I applaud the cast for their performances during their characters' deaths or their characters' horror at seeing other people without any warning just disintegrate. They really sold it there and, while I can't imagine what they must have felt watching other people die (especially with Tony - everyone with him died), I really cried. It's a very sobering moment.\nInfinity War is my current favourite of the MCU movies that I've seen so far and the best of all time, in my humble opinion.\nIt has one of the greatest plot twists of all time and really delivers on all the years building up to this one horrifying moment.\nCan't wait to sit down and watch Endgame!\nCan't emphasise this enough - go watch it!!!!", "Ticks all the marvel boxes but had a bit of a struggle to remember all of the plot threads from the previous films that led up to this one! Needed help from google to fill in the missing bits I'd lost from my brain.", "My favorite of all time. Terrific action and in depth in all it's characters. This film should be recognized more for it's theatrical achievements and not only it's monetary ones. You can never go wrong with the Avengers and I can't wait to see what they do after Endgame. A film for everyone, not just comic fans.", "This is gonna be short and comes rather late: Why kill Loki and so soon?? His death was totally uncalled for and completely illogical. He could use illusion and change shape- why wouldn't he just do it? He had already faked his own death-twice! Seriously, Marvel, give Loki (the amazing Tom Hiddleston) much more screen time in the movies! Apart from that, the movie was great, full of action , twists and humour, we've seen it several times and probably will watch it again.", "Marvel did it again. Oh, that's not exactly a compliment. It's a critic of the MCU films, if anything. Why did I wrote that? Here's my reasons:", "I went in expecting a boring superhero movie. Marvel proved me wrong. I loved it. Was heartbreaking. 9/10", "I went in expecting with all the memes there were going in, this was gonna be bad. I was never a fan of superhero movies, but this movie was amazing in all ways possible. I almost cried at the end. 9/10", "This movie has clearly a much darker tone than the previous ones, but that is what makes it more special. Really cool action scenes with occasional humor made it stand out more.", "The Russo brothers really did a great job in making this movie, an epic conclusion to the first decade of MCU.", "Avengers: Infinity War was clearly much better than Avengers: Endgame in the sense that 1) it was better in terms of writing, 2) it is the true culmination of an entire decade of MCU films, and 3) Endgame gave me more questions than answers.", "Infinity War is worth watching. The usual comedic banter between the casts, the awesome CGI, amazing plotline, the results did not disappoint.", "The character development for Thanos was so good that it made me think that maybe he was right. He was the villain that surpassed all the other villains from the past Marvel movies. Trust me, this is the movie that might have changed the MCU.", "This one is masterfully woven from the culmination of Marvel movies throughout the years. Truly amazing!", "Here we are 10 years later with one of the most anticipated movies of all time! The CGI was much better, the story was better...everything about the Infinity War was great!", "And I can't wait to see what will happen next. You are clueless and you don't know what will happen, keeping us all on the edge of our seats. Fascinating!", "He was an amazing villain that kept all the Avengers on their edge and made them think it was a bit hopeless to really go against him.", "With so many characters, the Russo brothers made an intelligent choice to center the emotional core of the film within a new character and the only one large enough within the narrative space to justify it: the antagonist. Outside of him, the movie's essentially the biggest episode of a serial ever. It does that quite well, but it ends up squeezing out Thanos a bit. He's good and enough to anchor a movie around, but everything else around him is pure spectacle and little else. I say little else because all of our heroes get their moments. Thor talking about everything he's lost. Vision and Scarlet Witch's little romance taking shape. Peter Quill's grief at the loss of a loved one. It's all there, but it almost all depends on things outside this movie to work. Not that anyone would ever come into this movie without having at least some knowledge of the myriad of franchises that precedes it, but I think it deadens the impact of the moments since the emotional workload isn't held within this movie itself. This isn't like the final moments of a three-part movie like The Lord of the Rings, this is the culmination of more than twenty films, each with their own adventures and main characters, that end up tying together here. So what you do have is a well-produced series of epic fights and events in the vein of a man on a mission type story, peppered with small character moments, revolving around the character of Thanos. Thanos is the biggest threat the Avengers have faced (other than Dormmamu who was going to wipe out the entire universe in Doctor Strange, I guess), and he's one of the better antagonists. I don't think he's miles better than Hela, Loki, or Vulture, but he's definitely in that league. He's a titan driven by an ideal, and he's pure psychopath. Some people put forward the idea that Thanos could use the power of the Infinity Stones to double the universe's resources, but that misses the point of the character. He's a Malthusian through and through. He sees intelligent life as a cancer, infecting the universe, and that's what must be wiped out. He's so psychotic that to even dream of reasoning with him is asinine. He's committed, and he demonstrate that commitment to his vision by sacrificing his beloved adopted daughter to gain one of the stones (the Soul Stone). Meanwhile, our heroes take on several different related goals. There's the attempt to remove and destroy the Mind Stone from Vision's forehead. There's Thor trying to replace Mjolnir. There's Iron Man leading Dr. Strange and Spider-Man (joined by most of the Guardians of the Galaxy) to fight Thanos before he gains full strength on the titan's destroyed home planet. The story is structured around these different tasks, each told with the Marvel brand of quippy humor, seasoned with just enough emotion borrowed from the franchise's history, and built to all crescendo at the same time. That crescendo, which really takes up the last hour or so of the film, is something to admire. There are so many pieces moving and so many parts flying in so many different locations that the fact that it's easy to understand who is involved in what and why on a consistent basis is kind of remarkable. The Russo Brothers have evolved a lot in terms of action cinematography since The Winter Soldier. They still have a preference for shallow depth of field, handheld camera, and close up photography, but they edit it a bit less frantically and pull back more than enough to firmly establish geography. One thing they haven't really grown on, though, is visuals in general. It's an interesting contrast to watch so many of these movies in a row. Just a few movies back was Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2. In it, everything with brightly colored with array of beautiful things. When Thor shows up in the Guardian's ship, the same location that was so easily bathed in color in the previous movie has been dialed back to almost complete darkness. The movie as a whole isn't dark (the fight in Wakanda is very brightly lit), but it's fascinating to see some of the same locations and costumes that had been so colorful drained of it all in this. I think it's an incorrect visual choice for the franchise, especially as it embraces its cosmic side. It needs to be crazier visually instead of dark and \"grounded\". Still, I find Thanos a good villain, the ride overall fun and engaging, and just wish that it didn't rely so much on the previous movies and looked brighter and more colorful. For a movie that I could not see as being anything other than an expensive mess, that's quite an accomplishment.", "It was a good movie but it was too long and lots of extra scenes", "I want this film to make a build up to us cause there is some people does not watch all marvel films and they did not understand this film because of that", "Ok, so nobody will ever read this, and in all probability, it'll just be lost among the crowd of reviews, but it's worth a chance, right? This is great. Pure gold. The best thing of 2018, followed by Ant-Man and the Wasp. Never got bored, not even once. You just have to love it. Don't listen to the haters, they have no taste whatsoever.", "Creative team has taken a huge risk and it pays off. By the end, the emotional takeaway is so beyond previous experiences, there's no choice but to be completely in. When is the next one?", "Avengers Infinity War is an amazing movie that brings all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy into one film. This is a very fast passed film with fantastic action and character interactions. The villain, Thanos, is the best in the MCU. this film is funny yet tragic at the same time. The cast is terrific and the CGI is good for the most part. At times it gets a little poor unfortunately. Having half the heroes die at the end was very shocking and a great way to go into the next film, even though I know they weren't going to stay dead. Overall a fantastic film. 9.4/10", "This movie is amazing because it always gives you ah, oh moment", "It is finally here.. the culmination of 10 years of multiple MCU story lines spanning 18 movies and ship-load of superheroes and their support cast which we have grown to love. Thanks to the well orchestrated marketing campaign as well as the gradual buildup over the years through all the story arcs converging to this climactic showdown, the tsunami of expectations for Infinity War had hit a crescendo before the release. Credit to the director duo of Russo brothers who have managed to deliver despite such stupendous expectations and hype. The movie is chock-a-block with our favourite superheroes and towering above all of them, is their nemesis - the mad titan Thanos who spells death, doom and destruction from the word go, as he sets out on a quest to capture all six infinity stones which would make him the most powerful entity of the universe. While the narrative is indeed weighed down by the sheer mass of the material on hand and the multiple characters vying for screen-time, the directors have managed to provide space for almost all of them to come into their own. Given the scale of the challenge at hand, the sinister designs of Thanos and his team and his superlative power which continues to multiply as the movie progresses, there is a palpable dark tinge that permeates the movie. Despite being shrouded under the dark cloud of impending doom an gloom, the narrative is frequently funny with clever cracking quips coming from the clash of several superhero sized egos as well as genuinely tongue-in-cheek conversations as all these characters get to know each other. The action is often frenetic and the set pieces are brilliantly mounted on a dazzling scale with scope for almost every character to shine in brief bursts. In a movie of this scale, with more superhero per minute than any other venture, Josh Brolin is impressively menacing as the invincible, Thanos who seeks to bring balance to the universe even if it involves wiping half of all lives, including many of our favourite superheroes, at the snap of his fingers. While some of the outcomes are on expected lines as indicated in the many trailers and teasers, the Russo brothers have packed quite a few nasty surprises that could leave the audience gawking, especially - an epic cliffhanger ending. As the dust settles after a feverish run-time of almost 160 minutes and an audacious climax (yup every minute counts.. including the end credit scene), the audience are left at a perilous precipice that is shocking and desperately seeking answers to multiple questions from the sequel that is slated to hit the screens next year. Till then... we are left to MARVEL ... What could be lying beyond this insidious infinity ?", "This film is way better than endgame. The actions are better, the writings better the dialogues better and better the cgi is better More shocks. Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored. The movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time and I'm definitely very excited.", "Unlike anything ever done by MCU, within the first five minutes you are able to understand how heavy and hopeless the plot will be in this movie.", "Starring: Robert Downey Jr (Iron Man), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff), Don Cheedle (Warachine), Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange), Tom Holland (Spider-Man), Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Karen Gillon (Nebula), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Paul Bettany (Vision), Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff), Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson), Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier), Danai Gurira (Okoye), Pom Klementieff (Mantis), Dave Bautista (Drax), Vin Diesel (Groot), Bradley Cooper (Rocket), Chris Pratt (Star Lord), Josh Brolin (Thanos)\nPlot: Earth and the whole universe is threatened by Thanos, who believes that the world is better with half of the people in the universe killed, and the Avengers are the only ones who can stop him...but will they be enough? Review: This movie is the darkest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the most epic in terms of scope and the threat that harms the world. This movie is not only a great movie, but a monumnental achievement and testament to Marvel's ability to realize its incredible vision. After 10 years and 19 movies Marvel has clearly shown that they know how to bring in hardcore and casual fans to the movies to see heroes dressed up in tights and saving the world. If you have been following this series and have watched most to all of the previous 18 MCU, this is a very satisfying payoff movie as it follows most of the heroes in the MCU. The Russos really outdid themselves, and through incredible editing and story telling they managed to tell a cohesive story that juggled numerous characters. Though there were so many characters in this movie, the movie gave most of the characters great moments. The standouts were probably Zoe Saldana as Gamora, and Josh Brolin as Thanos. You believed their relationship as daughter and father respectively and you felt the emotional consequences of their relationship and what that relationship entailed. This was also Thanos' movie. He is without a doubt, my favorite villain in the MCU now and he is up there with Jordan's Killmonger, Hiddleston's Loki, and Keaton's Vulture. Brolin exudes such confidence, ferocity, and charisma in his performance that he sells the fact that he really believes what he is doing is right no matter how evil he seemed. I actually found myself agreeing with some of Thanos' reasonings at some points of the movie. This was an unconventional narrative driven movie. It truly stands as a monument to Marvel's ability to deliver a different and unconventional comic book movie experience, and many studios will come to look at this as a paragon of how to do a payoff movie in a series. Many may even compare this to \"Lord of the Rings: Two Towers\" (2002), or \"Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) in its structure, but I believe this movie even stands apart from those movies. The only drawbacks that I saw was the fact that if this was your first MCU movie you will have no idea who the characters were and will be lost when watching this movie. Also, because there are so many characters in the movie some major characters don't get a chance to show up and get more moments, but I expected this going in. Truly, not only a great comic book movie, but an incredible movie watching experience.", "Ready? Here we go: 1. I love Avengers 1 & 2 and I was saddened a bit that Joss Whedon wasn't coming back as director for the 3rd installment. But after seeing Winter Soldier and Civil War, the Russo Brothers were the best men for the job and sure enough they didn't disappoint. 2. The most impressive thing about the movie is how it was able to fit more than 20 major characters in, each getting the appropriate screen time (Black Panther gets just enough considering we just saw him a couple of months ago), nothing feels rushed and/or badly edited (Justice League, Suicide Squad, anyone?) 3. While it is a Russo Brothers movie, we still get the Taiki Waititi Thor, the James Gunn Guardians of the Galaxy and all the others seamlessly interwoven that's why the running time of 149 minutes of excitement, joy and sadness just quickly went by. 4. I have to agree with the critics that while the story isn't it's main strength, in my opinion the movie still works because A) it was setup nicely by the previous MCU installments and B) each and every character was perfectly cast. From Tom Holland's Peter Parker (sorry Tobey Maguire) all the way to Josh Brolin's Thanos, no one seems out of place or trying hard to fit in. 5. Speaking of Thanos, he was so well-written and played that he almost got my buy-in on his desire to eradicate half of life in the universe in order to restore balance and allow the planet to heal and recuperate. I remember when news broke out about the first Avenger movie, I counted the days until I saw it in the cinema. Now, it's just 367 days left until Avengers 4 is released. I was thinking after this story arc, can they still top themselves? What else can they do that we haven't seen already? While there are other story lines that are worth telling, will they be able to recast the actors just as well? All things considered these are all good problems to have, they are still problems just the same. But with 19 movies already out and plenty more in the pipeline, I think the MCU has sorted all of this out and all we have to do is pony up the money.", "It was a great movie with non stop action and thrill that u will never have that feeling in any movie", "So this was a great conclusion to the Thanos enmity, BUT SPOILERS AHEAD.\nIf you've not seen it, watch it now but if like me you your favorite Avengers members are Thor Ironman and Hulk, in that order your in for some disappointments.\nThor he's his usual funny self and as usual throws down when it's needed, but and it's a big but, changing Hulk into Professor Hulk was a massive mistake, and losing Iron man was \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffca no no, but just decide for yourself and watch it.", "Simply for how it brought all these characters together. Its such a treat not just for comic book fans but for all cinema lovers. The shear scope of all the story lines gives this particular film a depth I cant seem to compare to anything I've watched before. This review is simply to highlight that fact. Sure, there have been a multitude of films with plenty of stage players, but I would argue none (except maybe lord of the rings trilogy) bring such original characters. Each one fully distinguished and realized by great adapting in both writing and performance. And if you are looking to just enjoy the comic book aspect, well the hero is appreciated more by the difficulty he or she faces in the villain. Infinity War delivers on the villainy in such unstoppable force and yet just as poetic as the hero's journey. See this film and indulge in these characters stories.", "A Bit overrated by marvel fans but this movie entrateins and has great action. The villain is OK and the heros are utilized in the right screentime. while i wouldnt say its a cinematic masterpiece , its definitely a good superhero and mcu movie. A Bit slow in the start. would reccomend watching after watching the others mcu movies. as a standalone it dosnt work.", "The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.", "The scale of this movie is astonishing. I felt like I was watching 4 different movies and they are connected to each other. Lots of laughs, emotions, excitement, and stories. Have to watch previous 20 Marvel films to fully connected to this movie. Great movie. At last end game.", "Thanos is best villain ever. Action is famous. Battles are amazing. Wakanda forever.", "It might just be my favourite Marvel movie. It cuts out all the boring stuff I don't like from the other movies and only keeps in the stuff I like, which makes this the quintessential Marvel movie for me. However, I feel like this movie may have been a little too good. I like this one so much, that I honestly don't have much reason to go back to any of the other Marvel movies. Infinity War has all my favourite elements from all of them and none of my least favourite. Why sit through the others when I can just watch this and get my fix? Anyway, this movie was great and I can't wait for Avengers: Endgame!!", "This was such an epic movie from start to finish had me hooked", "Love it this is by far the best marvel movie it is just like it made it for me", "This one is a 'kickass'. The one even the celebrities would line up to watch. It releases the inner child in you and let it, it feels good. ;) If you haven't seen Captain America series, Iron Man series, Thor series, Guardians of the Galaxy series, Avengers series, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, this movie is not going to make sense. Watch them all and then hit the BIG screen. :) Peace Out!", "This movie is probably my 2nd favorite marvel movie, it is just so perfect. For a 2 and a half hour long movie you dont feel it, unlike endgame, and unlike most part 1s of a 2 part finale, this one is the better part. In this film, the main character is Thanos, this is by far one of the best characters and villains in any superhero movie, I would only argue that the joker from dark knight is better and I doubt anything would top that. This film is just the right tone, dark, no sense of hope and quite bleak, it truly feels like they cant win the battle. The film sets up this tone perfectly by showing the asgardian ship from thor ragnarock completely destroyed and dead. Hulk tries to fight Thanos and gets beaten showing that even he cant beat him. Thanos snaps lokis neck and that sets up the tone for the rest of the movie, the fact that marvel of all people killed off a main character in like 5 minutes. Already you can tell this film will be different and it is. It's a superhero film in which the heros lose, and lose a lot. Even though I knew they would somehow be brought back to life I still felt the pain the heros felt. The film makes you think they can win especially with thor coming down with the Stormbreaker, but even than thanos still snaps half of the universe away. Those deaths were pretty meaningless but the true deaths of Loki, Vision and Gamora were really rough to watch, especially vision with it being clear he wont come back. Overall, with my biased towards every spiderman movie put aside, this is the second best marvel film and easily the best avengers movie.", "This movie is great l, but it is better when you view it from Thanos's perspective. It has all the superheros in this one, and it was so thrilling. But I felt like it was a new step of the mcu when Thanos snaps his fingers at the end to kill half the half the universe. Great movie and gave me chills at the end.", "Thanos, you're an amazing detail.Marvel is really well prepared for the film because it shows in every frame.I realized that Thanos had a heart under his muscular appearance.The film tells how many superheroes are going to tell us without fainting, and the story flows through several different branches. So, rather than gathering all the superheroes and making us watch 2-hour challenge battles, we're watching teams of superheroes divided into teams clash with Thanos in many locations and variations.So this movie was very very good.", "One of the best movie of all-time. Epic, spectacular, emotional, and well-written.", "A lot of better than first and second part for me!", "Play Avengers: Infinity War! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!", "To combine so many characters from across the MCU (the original Avengers, the Guardians, Dr. Strange and so many others) and to do it so well is simply spectacular. Handling a battle is difficult, but to handle so many fronts is even harder. The writers did an amazing job. Regarding the directors: \u00a1Amazing work! They managed to make a good movie and actually gave us a heroes movie where the good guys loose. And the loose hard. Thanos (Josh Brolin) is an extraordinary villain. Also... what an spectacular entrance from Thor in Wakanda. Amazing.", "Unless you've been living under a rock for the past decade or so you might have heard of a little production company by the name of Marvel Studios. Creating motion picture adaptations of Marvel Comics properties, they've had a surprisingly consistent track record for delivering satisfying big budget superhero entertainment. The fact that they also managed to tie everything together into a cohesive shared universe is something that frankly hadn't been seen to that extent in movies before. All of the care that went into these productions culminated in 2018's \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and its direct sequel, 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame\". Together they proved to be a fitting capper to Marvel's journey that began with \"Iron Man\" in 2008. First of all, it's important to recognize that this movie is part one of a two part story. I didn't realize this when I originally watched the movie, so I was somewhat disappointed that the story wasn't brought to a resolution. Later on, when rewatching the movie ahead of the concluding chapter, I got a better appreciation of what the movie was meant to be. As had been hinted at for years, \"Infinity War\" finally marked the entrance of Thanos into the Marvel universe as a major villain. He seeks to acquire the six Infinity Stones, which will make him powerful enough to restore balance to the universe... by laying half of it to waste. Naturally, our heroes the Avengers aren't about to just let that happen. However, Thanos's power increases with the acquisition of each new stone, so stopping him becomes a race against time. For a movie that's the culmination of 19 previous films, a memorable villain was a must. Luckily, Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is one of the most memorable in the Marvel canon. No doubt much of the credit goes to the original creator of the character (Jim Starlin) but the fact is that Thanos gives the impression that he's someone who could give the Avengers a run for their money. In fact, he's such a formidable foe that the threat of defeat is more palpable than in any previous Marvel movie. That his motivations are also interesting from a philosophical point of view is another point in the movie's favour. Having a compelling villain is of course a crucial element in any superhero movie but in this case the sheer scale of the undertaking is impressive in and of itself. Featuring a star-studded cast of Marvel veterans in the various heroic roles, it's amazing that the producers managed to keep the shared universe alive this long just to be able to put this movie together in the first place. That they managed to keep the movie from collapsing under the weight of its stars is another testament to their commitment to quality. Despite a fairly hefty two and a half hour runtime, the movie is nicely paced and gives a reasonable amount of screentime to all involved. My only real complaint is that the final act's impact is somewhat muted by the utter improbability that certain characters will be gone for good since they already had sequels in the pipeline. Surely they could have stuck to characters whose fate was less certain? \"Infinity War\" may not be the type of movie I'd watch for awards-worthy work on either side of the camera but as a feat of production I think that it and its (superior) sequel are nearly unparalleled. It makes me wonder if \"Endgame\" might be shown some love at the next Oscars ceremony. I mean, \"Black Panther\" was nominated for Best PIcture and that was arguably more about cultural impact than the actual merits of the production (though I wouldn't have argued if Michael B. Jordan was nominated). In any case, Marvel fans don't need any convincing to watch this movie. For others, this probably isn't the best starting point.", "This movie is not good as much avenger 2012 and first spider man. The good thing about this movie is: it opens the door for next good potential movie.", "I've decided to go ahead and finish up with End Game and then probably call it quits with Marvel. Marvel's decent but nothing ever blows me away because it always has to be a mix with serious/funny. Problem is it's not actually funny and just ruins the moment 9 times out of 10. Yes I get that in real life people use humor to deal with tragic situations such as at a funeral but I don't need a \"witty quip\" in the middle of a fight to the death. It takes you out of it and makes it seem like the moment isn't as significant. The last fight at Wakanda was dope though I have to give it credit there. It also had a pretty intriguing end that made me want to throw on the next one so it did something good there for sure. The enormity of the situation was actually felt there and I'm intrigued to see it end. I guess Spiderman is part of phase 3 but whatever I'm watching Ant-Man and the Wasp then Endgame then probably being done with Marvel forever and not spending my time on movies I only find average. That's a really dumb use of my time and I'm not blaming anyone for liking the movies as they are well done but don't resonate enough with me.", "The Magic and Powerful tone of this movie is incredible Thanos played by josh brolin is what really makes this movie shine I haven't seen him in movie since MIB 3 amazing proformances all of them The greatest MCU movie ever", "I'm not a big comic book fan, or movies made from them, or blockbuster movies in general, but I really enjoyed this. Yes, as others have said, it is too long -- I think they could have taken time from each of the battle scenes which would have cut the overall running time nicely without losing anything really important. Yeah, the CGI stuff is fun, but after a while, I get bored with it all. I watched this via Nexflix, so I ended up watching it in two parts which helped to keep it fresher for me. Previously I had watched both Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor, both of which I really liked. Another reviewer mentioned that the naysayers needed to have watched the earlier individual superhero movies as their story lines were meant to meet here. That does make sense to me. Although, if you were to watch this cold turkey with a relatively open mind, then you should be able to pretty much suss out what is happening without all of the other back grounding. Which I guess quite a number of reviewers here weren't interested in doing. Their loss. This movie was really funny! The dialogue with the self-effacing humour and the inside jokes was so nicely done. This was what I also liked about Guardians and Thor. I almost didn't watch those movies because I thought they were going to be just all action (which as already mentioned, bores me pretty quickly), but I was pleasantly surprised. I'm now actually more interested in seeing the other individual hero movies (Iron Man, Hulk, etc), if they're going to have this kind of banter and lightness in them. I'm always more interested in the human/android/etc interactions than the never ending battle stuff. I loved Thor always calling Rocket a bunny! In fact this makes me think that what was put down as a \"character error\" here about him always pronouncing the destination as \"Nivadellir\" instead of \"Nidavellir\" actually wasn't an error at all. As he tells Rocket, he's been a God for over two thousand years... he doesn't really give a crap if he's pronouncing something incorrectly, or calling Rocket a bunny instead of a fox. And well, unless you're Captain Kirk, the average person (or character in a movie) just isnt going to question a God. Hahaha. I also enjoyed that the writing of the main characters and the actors playing them actually had some complexity and depth (once again, keeping my attention from wandering, lol). Thanos in particular was so well done. Like really well done (kudos to the writers and Josh Brolin). It is rare that the villain is done this way. But a villain that makes sense and that you can agree with on some levels is far scarier than a cardboard box stereotype. It's the people who you can relate to, or even like, that can hurt you the most. The Thanos character brought up some important issues. Not everyone and everything can live. It is heartbreaking. It is terrible, but it's true. There just isn't the room and resources on this Earth in particular to keep up with the never ending onslaught of human carelessness. But who are we going to trust to make those awful decisions? Who would have the psychological strength to make them, and be partisan about it? As Thanos said, the choices are made irrespective of gender, race or wealth. It was not done without personal loss and pain. I loved at the ending when he's sitting up high, looking out, and feeling such loneliness. I also love that Thanos's endgame created a quandary for me, a viewer, cos I'm not quite sure who's side I'm now. Is Thanos really a villain, or are the super heroes (and the rest of us) not looking at the whole picture? The ending was quite interesting. It wasn't all happy, happy. There were terrible losses, which were hard to watch. Although, it does make me think that as the other superhero movies were a portal into this movie, then this movie will also a portal into the next sequel where these losses will be righted. I hope so anyway. P.S. The battle in Wakanda reminded me of a crazy teched out version of the big battle in The Return of the King.", "Great movie great story Entertaining and unexpected especially compared with last Avenger", "I think this film is the best film for the marvel fandom this film is dramatic action packed and has great characters and story this film does not deserve being this good and this is coming from a film that had all the potential for being a cluster flop and we as people should not deserve this film and this is the best superhero film since the dark knight", "Indeed my favorite Avengers Movie till maybe I watch 'EndGame'. Had some dull moments but if the action comes it's really a good and memorable one. Thanos is indeed good and my favorite character in the movie. This movie is a must watch for all Marvel fans period!!", "I love this movie. i'm basically blown away for the entire runtime, even on the fifth viewing. action packed and epic. the perfect amount of funny. filled with beautiful shots. an awesome story with a beastly villain who you begrudgingly sympathize with. i can't believe how many characters were in this movie, as well as the mammoth of a cast that comes with it. so many memorable scenes, and when i say memorable, i mean i remember the exact moment i first witnessed them. the music frequently gives it a Shakespearean tragedy vibe. well done on all counts (5 viewings, 5/11/2020)", "6/10 - this superhero crossover had too many lead characters to where the story felt like it was all over the place and not really connected", "How did Marvel Studios do this. Make this many characters work in one movie. The chemistry between different teams was great. The only part that drags for me is when the Guardians go the Knowwhere. The Battle of Wakanda is epic and Thor's arrival is top 5 Mcu moments. Plus the snap was totally unexpected and shocking the first time in the theater.", "Beautiful movie with a perfect plot and very well performed, really great special effects and never bore", "", "Its a very good movie but its a little bit sad. However its very good!", "Everything about this movie was great and fit in with the whole Marvel Universe perfectly. At no point in the film was anything boring and every second of the movie was heart pounding and very exciting. It is very better than the first two Avenger movies and it is also very different from the first two due to the fact that most of the movie takes place in space and other planets which im fine with, but im used to seeing Avengers movies take place on Earth similarly to the first two but its still amazing nonetheless. One slight problem that i had and keep in mind this is little to not even a small problem; some intense fight scenes and action sequences have too many things going on at once and so many characters on screen at once which is cool, but it can distract you and confuse you but i learned to just go with it, like i said, it can either be good or bad, and i think its a little bit of both. Thanos was great and a great villain for the film and did an excellent job at being and acting like one. Another personal problem was that im watching all the Avengers movies (4 movies) in a row and it gets kinds confusing here since i haven't seen doctor strange or guardians of the galaxy, but i get the whole jyst and at least i know who they are; it might have been a stupid choice, but its too late now anyway. A lot of new character to sink in; and also the ending could have been better, i know theres Endgame and its supposed to be a cliffhanger but for me it wasn't strong enough. Great movie nonetheless!!!", "Endgame is million time better. Efects are good, but actors are not so good. But Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman and Chris Evans are great. But others are not so good.", "Well!!\nI loved this movie. Amazing effects! One of the most epic showdown movie!", "Alot of hipsters and too big for their britches type of people giving this 1/10 and all that. This movie was great, the ending was emotional and well these reviews show that some people are hard to please. No one cares about your dislike of it, the movie is well done.", "In my opinion Avengers Infinity War is the best MCU film so far. This film makes you hate and feel empathy for Thanos at certain parts in the film.", "It has pretty much everything sad moments, happy moments and shocking moments. The saddest thing I saw was when Spider-Man BLIPED (Spider-Man homecoming) I was shocked, sad and confused. The shocking moment when Dr. Strange is when he gave the time stone to thanos to spare Tony Stark's life. Every part Before the fighting was happy and shocking", "After seeing the reviews of most ppl, i went to this film with very low expectations but honestly it was a great surprise, a very shocking mind blowing and kinda unexpected ending ( i just sat there for 10 minutes trying to process it )... Don't listen to the haters and definitely don't let them spoil you...", "Something for all here: Lots of destruction, an all star hero cast, an armed raccoon and not to forget the famous stones. Like in other Marvel movies stay at the end, and this time with NYC in dust.", "It balances so many characters very well. Thanos is one of the best villains of all time. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll get frustrated. The characters have their flaws and their own morals. It's a journey coming to a close. It's the movie of an era.", "Avengers Infinity War, what can I say? It's a solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a major epic film. Truth be told, the movie was supposed to be released in 2020, but we got it in 2018, which was great. The one thing that was anticipated by most besides Thanos, was the Avengers meeting the Guardians of the Galaxy. We got that, but the only problem I had with them meeting was I didn't get to see the team-ups I wanted. It doesn't bring down the film, but I am a little disappointed. The movie has a four way story. One is Tony and his team, Two, Thanos and his quest for the stones, Three, Thor creating Stormbreaker, Four, Steve Rogers and the secret avengers. I really only cared about the Tony Stark and Thanos parts of the movie, because Tony was meeting different people like on Civil War, and Thanos was tracking down the Infinity Stones. The Russos oddly have writing that has Iron Man do more exciting stuff than Cap. Like on Civil War, Tony recruited Spider-Man and had Black Panther on his team. While Cap had a bunch of people we knew already. My point being is that the Russos seem to focus on Iron Man more than the others when it comes to their writing. Iron Man meets all the cool heroes, while Cap is the same old, same old. They aren't bad writers, but I do think Whedon was better because he gave us the team ups/interactions we wanted. Finally, that ending, It was unexpected and left everyone in the theater heartbroken. The Avengers lost, and it was a good strategy to keep us eager for the next film. Great movie, I see it all the time and hardly have any complaints.", "Be prepared to cry. Be prepared for the bad guy to win for the first time ever. This movie takes all the expectations you had and throws them out the window. It's beautiful, cinematic, and tugs at your heartstrings. It's a must watch for Marvel fans.", "I loved this movie it was amazing. Also it was a little sad but not that bad and you should watch it because it might just be one of my favourite movies now.", "I greatly enjoyed this Marvel film. Might be my favorite super hero flick.", "A true epic event film. A non-stop thrill ride of superhero action with a great twist at the end. Also the first superhero movie I know of where the actual protagonist is the villain, and Josh Brolin's Thanos shines as he carries this movie to near perfection.

This film made Thanos my all time favorite Marvel villain. Thanos isn't a villain that wanted to destroy humanity just for the sake of destroying humanity, he wanted to destroy half of it because he feared overpopulation. You can actually see where he's coming from. I love how they made this film a lot more darker and grittier than the previous installments. It really works well. This film is also very emotional as well. And of course it also had a very sad ending where black panther, falcon, the guardians of the galaxy except for rocket, doctor strange, Bucky, and of corse spider-man turn to dust. Overall, Avengers Infinity War is absolutely PHENOMENAL!", "A perfect movie! Antony and Joe keep the movie interesting and full of action all along without any mistakes.", "The best, #1, head honcho, big cheese, big deal, numero uno of the 4 Avengers films. You have action, adventure, insane special effects and CG work. Excellent Marvel sarcasm and interaction between the heroes. One of the best villain portrayals, without going into deep character development. So much that at times you will find yourself having emotions for a positive conclusion for the heel. Only drawback of the film is the oversized cast of good and evil participants, which may, limit the screen time for the hero or villain you want to see.", "The story was so so great , I really like it too much . the acting was magnificent , and the fighting scenes were amazing. It's really worth my time , that's why I recommend it to all. 8/10", "This movie is amazing. Full of action and emotions, great story, straight to the point, and probably one of the few movies that end in a bad ending. Which is nice, since we don't see those type of movies that often. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!", "This movie is just so amazing! Even though it has so many characters it never feels like one character is more on screen than the others (except for Thanos of course!).", "Now that Avengers: Endgame has been released, it seems high time to re-evaluate its predecessor, Infinity War. Endgame was certainly able to do more with setup than simply resolving it, in fact introducing new arcs and conflicts to keep the movie interesting in its own right. Regardless, Infinity War deserves much praise for being able to set up the dramatic scenario of Endgame, while being entertaining on its own.\nInfinity War centers around anti-hero Thanos (Josh Brolin) on his quest to collect all six Infinity Stones, in order to wipe out half of all living beings. His reasoning? \"This universe's resources are finite. If left unchecked, life will cease to exist.\"\nThe film's opening scenes depict Loki failing to trick Thanos in an attempt to save his brother, Thor, and protect the Tesseract, which holds the Space Stone. Despite a surprise attack from Hulk, which seems to turn the tides, Thanos eventually overpowers him and acquires his second Infinity Stone. In this very first sequence, Infinity War introduces its key theme of inevitability. Time and again, the Avengers appear to gain the advantage, only for Thanos to beat them back and continue his destructive plot.\nIn one of the film's most iconic scenes, Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) uses the Time Stone to look into \"14,000,605\" possible futures. When Tony Stark asks, \"In how many do we win?\" he pauses, then replies \"One.\" With the extra context of Endgame, we know that this singular future is the one in which Thanos \"wins,\" and then the Avengers triumph in Endgame (more on that later). At the time of first viewing, however, Doctor Strange's lines imply, (in one of the most intensely mocked moments of Infinity War) when Strange simply gives the Time Stone to Thanos, that the universe has already lost. This perfectly sets up Endgame, where the Avengers crawl back from a world which has already lost.\nBut! in Endgame, the ultimate theme of inevitability is turned on its head, and the viewer realizes that Doctor Strange's odd decisions were actually necessary to defeat Thanos. Rewatching Infinity War now not only dramatically recontextualizes the \"14,000,605\" scene in a sad new way, but also totally rewrites Strange's apparent 'turn to the dark side' as a clever ploy, establishing that, with Strange's help, the salvation of the universe in Endgame is what was truly inevitable.\nThis fantastic scriptwriting, by the Russo brothers, is what truly brings these two films into masterpieces. Needless to say, the graphical effects are also likely the best and most believable ever seen, from miniscule dust particles adding immersion to perfectly rendered faces, like Hulk and Thanos. Aside from that, the most common complaints about both films are from poor character development. The role of Drax (Dave Bautista) was mostly unfunny crude comments in Infinity War, and he (thankfully) isn't present much in Endgame. Even more egregious is the role of Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), who is not at all present in Infinity War, and barely contributes in Endgame despite being portrayed as incredibly powerful. Granted, Infinity War and Endgame were filmed before Captain Marvel (Brie Larson's introduction). Thus, the character was not yet established and didn't even have an actor in time for Infinity War. Still, this obscenely powerful character being absent from Infinity War, when she is needed most, is not at all excused by \"there are a lot of other planets in the universe\" (her brief explanation from Endgame).\nIn any case, it seems apparent that Anthony and Joe Russo are much less interested in individual characters than their fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe directors like James Gunn. It's clear that Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame prioritized their overall directions more. The way these two films take totally contrasting stances with the common theme of inevitability gives each film a unique flavor. Where Infinity War felt like a spiraling fall into calamity, Endgame feels like a desperate crawl towards salvation, eventually leaving a single, inevitable outcome of victory. Ultimately, Endgame seems to outshine its predecessor, but largely because of its impressive setup thanks to Infinity War. Like the first and last acts of the same story, the first builds tension and ends in climax, and the latter manages to bring the climax to a close, rewriting the tragedy of the first, with some major lasting sacrifice still in effect. Truly, there is no better outcome to get us excited for Spiderman: Far From Home!", "Avengers Infinity War All action but all over the place! Action packed for sure, with a storyline that kept me entertained and on the edge of my seat. All goes on in this thriller, and the action scenes throughout the film all make it intense! The battle on Wakanda makes it all the epic... There are some elements to it which make me think that it has gone a little overboard...these infinity stones and magical powers of different characters and things in space and the universe steer more toward a Star Wars theme for me, which is fine but not in these type of superhero movies! The scene with doctor strange giving the time stone to Thanos to save Iron mans life is too farfetched for me, especially considering the ending where everyone else \"died\" Despite this, this all action movie did impress and was much better than the age of ultron... the mix of superheroes was, for the first time, somewhat cool and worked in this movie!\nJ-Boss Reviews gives 8.8/10", "I have always wanted superhero films to go beyond the usual tactics of heroes saving the world (and not just the USA) and make a little sense while at it, which is exactly what Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War manages to do, albeit with some sudden melodrama.

Not all of the films in this franchise are good, but almost all of them are watchable (at least once). This film was really good, but, like I said above, you really have to put in the work if you want to reap the rewards. If you like the MCU, you already know you're going to see this movie anyways, and you're probably willing to forgive it for most of its flaws. This movie is absolutely worth seeing. It won't win any large awards at the Oscars next year, but it's certainly a very well done and extremely entertaining comic book movie; in the end, that's why we came to the theatre.", "For me this movie is good because it makes a good example why a eschatology is basically a stupid idea. The plan \"for the end of times\" falls and any two pieces won't fit together, leaving the story in need of a very dynamic part to simply jump from one aspect to another. And in this case, the script does deliver: they have to jump far and to jump often and with enough FX so audience won't stop to think WHY? In a way the audience becomes a junkie saying \"gimme more\". I was quite disappointed of the end, but thanks to Wikipedia now I know that was actually Part 1, and there is a Part 2, pretty much like the final part in the Harry Potter money machine.", "First of all, I'd like to criticize some things from the movie. First, what is up with the 9 seconds of black screen and followed with 34 seconds of the studio? Take note from other movie devs please. Next is, first scene, Thanos was supposed to kill half of the population in Asgard, but it appeared as if he wiped out the entire Asgard. What was Hulk doing before Loki said \"We have Hulk\" ? Hulk didn't bother lending a helping hand? and Thanos DESTROYED Hulk with only Power Stone, and yet at the end of the movie, Captain America can held Thanos' punch with his bare hand eventhough Thanos had already acquired 5 infinity stones. Next, about Thanos' goons, they were never introduced to us and MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) never bothered to tell us why they are so powerful and why Thanos needed them when he is already strong himself. and Thanos asked his goons to find the infinity stones, but didn't he said \"Fine, I'll do it myself\" in the last movie? need a little bit of confirmation here. Hulk and Banner have different memories in the previous movie, but why it seemed like Banner knew what Hulk encounter? It'll be too long for a review if I continue criticizing every single bit of this movie, but overall, its a good movie, I'd give 8 out of 10 because of the actings of the actors, and the plot twist, the story-telling, and this movie's hype, very nice editing too, nice CGI placement, and all.", "Just like the title, Avengers, Infinty War, Join all heroes for one but screen.

It requires several viewings just to comprehend all the material this film contains. Its strengths are in its ludicrously intense levels of action and mayhem, as well as a great performance from Josh Brolin, who finally brings to life the most well-developed MCU villain to date. Weaknesses? Some pretty hard-to-ignore plot holes and an ending that fails to evoke the emotion in the way it so enthusiastically tries to. Final Remarks? Avengers: Infinity War is for anyone looking for an explosive, edge-of-your-seat adventure, but those seeking a richer and deeper emotional resonance will gravitate towards Endgame.", "*Spoilers ONLY for the worst parts of the movie*\nTo start with you will be utterly confused,if you have not watched some of the previous movies, you wouldnt understand most of what is going on. So it is downright inaccessible to anybody who hasnt experienced most marvel films before (or at the least i recommend the knowledge of ironman, thor : dark world, avengers, avengers infinity war)\nI went into endgame not expecting too much, because i knew that even if you threw all the characters into a blender ,you would still end up with a good enough movie . Thats all i ever wanted but i left the theater on a more confused note.\nThere were some amazing scenes but they were too few and scattered to make that much impact.\nAny movie needs a good story but when you are talking about 25 + superheroes, trying to get everybody into the story is a bit too much considering the amount of screen time an average movie has. So everybody accepted it that its a great thing when we knew that the endgame was going to be 3 hours. But turns out the movie focuses so much on the actual time travel stuff. The story just dumbs down and becomes too slow. The tension element that the avengers have to get the stones back to save a universe is constantly dumbed down by throwing scenes like cap seeing his love,ironman meeting his father (and jarvis), thor meeting his mother.. comeon is this endgame or avengers : thanksgiving ? Even scenes which could have been impactful like cap vs cap are just over too quickly and nobody will remember them on the following day.\nThe only one necessary for the story out of these, is of ironmans and it still could have been shorter. The movie just loses its thriller element and feels like ''oh well they are just going to stroll through and collect some stones. nothing much.''\nThor is just lost as a character in this movie after they spend so many movies building him up as a character and finally gave him the love he deserved in infinity war. It feels like such a waste.\nNot just Thor, Hulk doesnt get any action scenes in this movie considering they turned him into professor hulk.\nAnd so didnt Groot. Groot has 3-4 secs of screentime\nSome of the biggest and fan favorite heroes left in the dust. In infinity war, thor just slices through the kamehameha of a six infinity stone powered lvl 100 thanos and wrecks him, now equipped with both mjolnir and stormbreaker , he still cannot do anything to a normal lvl 1 thanos\nI mean since ragnarok hulk has been in a fight with himself. In infinity war he just fights in ironmans hulk buster armor.I thought they were saving his big world breaker mode or something for endgame but turn out even after hearing natasha is dead, he doesnt get angry. Just tosses a table and is done. Makes no sense especially considering they gave LOADS of screen time to characters like nebula, gamora and hawk eye over whom most of us would have preferred to see the original avengers like hulk and thor smashing some aliens. And just to remind you people, the action scenes in this movie,the crux where you get to see your favorite heroes fight together in action is justtttttttttttttttttt 28 mins ... from 2:02:00 to 2:30:00 , arrival of Thanos's ship to thanos's death and that too is stretching it. yes i clocked it. The other 2 and a half hour movie is just time travel bullshit and thor crying, hawkeye ( i swear to god that guy had more screentime than captain america) and natasha ranting, going spy in the 1970s and just goofing around till the director says ,get out.\nIts still a good movie, because even if they randomly showed all the characters saying bunch of stuff to each other that didnt make sense, i would still say it a good movie because thats is what a fan wants .. just to see his favorite superheroes together. There are some good jokes, few awesome fight moments.\nThere is so much that can be edited out and so many other heroes that needed more love and action but in conclusion, endgame is still a worthy watch for any fan.", "Big fan of the Avengers but got a bit behind and only saw Infinity War today. I wanted to watch all the spin offs like Doctor Strange and Black Panther to get an idea of the characters. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to see Endgame!! One thing that annoyed me is that my favourite Avenger Captain America doesn't have his classic shield!!", "This is what i want to see in a comic movie! action from beginning to end and lots of epic moments.", "Infinity War is one of the greatest crossover events in cinema history. It wastes no time and jumps straight into the plot because it expects the audience to already know who the characters are. Thanos is one of the best MCU villains, he is evil. He has a clear goal, that of which he thinks is good, but everyone else thinks the opposite. The minions are expendable and the audience does not get to learn about them before they die. These characters are also all pitted against mirrors of the MCU, matching powers of the villains and heroes is a great touch. The movie, while making a small amount of jokes, hit each one on the head. While the jokes are few, the witty banter between similar characters provide for wonderful interactions and introductions. The fight scenes are epic and the adventure of Thor provides from a good break away from the other two plots. Each plot has a different setting which allows for great contrast in background between blacks, oranges, and greens. Overall good action packed movie.", "It is an Avenger superhero movie and it develops as it is to be expected. It's chaotic, relentless in its progression and there's just so much happening that's quite hard to take seriously half of it. Every scene has a new character, a new development, something unreasonable happening. There's just too much to be done for a single movie and as a consequence most of it is mediocre in its execution.\nOn the other hand, it's entertaining in its action and combat scenes. Effects are great and the soundtrack fitting. The saving grace is the ending, maybe the only unexpected bit of the entire movie.", "Amazing kind of movie with a lot of action. You gonna love if you are a true marvel fan but if you are not believe me You Will Be", "Manages to work in the previous 18 MCU movies into a fairly cohesive enterprise. Funny yet sad.

From start to finish the action is great, the storyline is awesome, and so many emotions overcame me throughout. The end was just flawlessly captured, and I left saying \"I don't feel so good, (Mr. Stark.)\" It was incredible", "I didn't write a review after seeing this movie when it first hit theaters, but after watching ENDGAME, I've decided to leave a review for this. Of course, I did recently for ENDGAME as well. To me, Infinity War is definitely on par with another epic movie by DC called The Dark Knight. Actually, I would give it a higher rating even though Heath Ledger's performance as the JOKER was outstanding. Josh Brolen's portrayal as THANOS is phenomenal. Incidentally, after watching ENDGAME...a movie with poor scripting, many plotholes, bad portrayal of characters, too predictable, regurgitated CGI, SJW involvement, time-line sequence and theories god aweful, and of course.....the supposed GOOD-GUYS always win bs. Infinity War sums sums up the entire MCU movies beginning with IRON MAN. I DO NOT AND WILL NOT COUNT CAPTAIN MARVEL AND ENDGAME AS A CONTINUATION OR FINALE. The plot in Infinity War was awesome and easy to follow. Acting was great!(Especially THANOS). Had a villain that had moral ambiguity depending on your thoughts. The emotions were great. Battle scenes were awesome. Very unpredictable. Had a great mix of drama,action,comedy all wrapped into one. Special effects were amazing. The finale was the best for me. Not because a supposed bad-guy won, but the way THANOS' character was portrayed. Why does the good-guy always have to win? SMH! For all true MCU fans, INFINITY WAR should be the epic finale...not ENDGAME. Only casuals will believe the reverse. Yeah, I'll agree...the MCU hasn't fell exactly inline with the comics...but it's not suppose to. Otherwise, it would be too predictable. However, I still believe this movie will be a classic! To sum this up, if you decide to watch this movie...please watch the preceding MCU movies to get a better understanding of INFINITY WAR. There's a connection with all of them(with the exception of Captain Marvel which was pointless...and was pointless for THE ENDGAME as well). I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! WATCHED IT AGAIN LAST NIGHT SO THAT MY MIND WOULD BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE EPIC FINALE!!!!", "It's like some angel made this movie . Everything is so perfect plus the ending remarkable . And this movie save my favorite mcu villain Loki . Other than that great movie they balance the characters so awesomely . Like made thor fat ,hulk hand got damaged , cap now can use mjolnir they this movie is just perfect", "In one word to describe Infinity war is just fabulous fantastic superb awesome mind blowing etc etc", "I have not seen all 21 films in the story arc that serves as the background for this penultimate episode in the MCU series that will soon culminate in \"Avengers: Endgame\". Seeing those films could only help, but it is not necessary. A general knowledge of the Marvel characters is probably enough to enjoy this wonderful spectacle. A complex villain named Thanos is determined to collect all six of the infinity stones, which would give him nearly infinite power. An extraordinarily large cast of Marvel superheroes combines forces to stop him. CGI is used in abundance to create a non-stop display of environments and conflicts. Like other Marvel films, the production relies on three major cornerstones to create an enjoyable experience: 1. Comedy is used to offset the heavy emotional elements of the film. Sometimes this is achieved by juxtaposing grandiose speech with commonplace speech, often employing pop culture references. 2. Suspension of disbelief is required in large doses to allow the writers to manipulate the epic elements of the story for conflict and dramatic effect. 3. Larger-than-life environments are used for their wow factor. \"Infinity War\" has these three elements in spades. The plot requires our heroes to overcome nearly impossible odds, say 1 in 14,000,605. Disparate factions of the Marvel superheroes collection are introduced to each other in an all out battle. The film ends with the ultimate cliffhanger, especially considering that Marvel promises a grand conclusion that will reset Marvel's future forever.", "This movie surpassed all expectations. From start to finish there was action, humor, drama and it was well balanced without the tone going overboard. Thanos is the best mcu villain. He is menacing, but at the same time, a villain with honor who doesn't randomly kill unless threatened. Action sequences were well done ( Wakanda entrance tho GOD DAMN)and CGI was great", "This movie is very good I think it is not boring like some people say", "I watched the film Endgame, just the day before today, and it was amazing, so I gave it a brief but powerful review. Then, I realized I had forgotten to thank the film that led to Endgame, the one that broke my heart and warmed it at the same time. This film made me laugh, made me sit on the edge of my seat, made me cry, and made me infuriated for some people, making me want to throw a punch. This film makes you feel all the emotions: heartbreak, happiness, humor, and even fear. This will leave you wailing and complaining, needing more to satisfy you. Endgame is certainly more emotional and powerful than this one, with the topping 9.2 ratings, while this one is conveniently sitting at 8.5. This film and Endgame both made me confident, standing up to cruelty in my school, and letting me embrace how far Marvel has come.", "There is no film, or series that is comparable to the Avengers entire series and Infinity War completely blew Age of Ultron away. I think the directors, and writers for this movie deserve a ton of credit for how they wove all the MCU movies to this point together without skipping a beat. What they did was so complex, yet it came out very easy to follow as I watched the movie. One mistake anywhere throughout the film easily could have blown everything, but I thought it was flawless. The last 2 Transformers movies are a good example of a high budget movie where a couple mistakes early on just take all the credibility out of the viewing experience and then the viewer can't help but roll their eyes throughout. I double down: Infinity Wars maintained credibility throughout and there were absolutely no character hiccups. I'd like to point out that in the most star studded cast ever Josh Brolin stood out and completely stole the show, in his portrayal of Thanos. They did a really cool job with the CGI to sort of make Thanos resemble Brolin and also follow his movement. I assume they would have had Brolin in some sort of a suit so they could easily mimic his movements for the character, but his voice acting was on another level. The way he inflected the tone just sent chills down my spine, and sent the message across to me of exactly what Thanos is all about. Like you can tell from the tone in his voice that he's been wiping out planets and civilizations for so long that he feels no remorse, and he's actually doing a good deed to the Universe every time. The scariest part of Thanos is that he truly believes he's the good-guy even though we've all established that he is the most evil dude in the Universe. I couldn't have imagined anyone else coming anywhere near how well Josh Brolin portrayed this megalomaniac! They did such a great job of casting every character I think. So far there is only 2 actors that I didn't like cast for the role they're in: 1. I don't like the way Danai Gurira plays Okoye who is T'Challa's right hand lady in Wakanda. She just always seems like she's trying too hard to be tough. The other person I don't like the casting of and has me sort of dreading End Game is Brie Larson who plays Captain Marvel who is supposed to save everyone in the next movie as we got the little Egg in the final scene after the credits of Infinity War. Other than that the cast is great. The balance of all this different colourful personalities of super-hero's seems to be spot on here. I highly recommend watching this 10/10 high-octane, super-smash, block-buster hit!!", "Even arter watching all of the other movies, this is All that you can expect and much more! Not going to Spoil it. I am just going to say great script, great acting, great cgi. An emotional rollercoaster: Impecable!!!

Greetings from sda!", "I've grown up on Marvel comics and really thought the first Avengers was the coup de grace of comic film-then I saw Winter Soldier and Civil War.

Unexpected ending that no one could have predicted. My favourite three characters, being IRON MAN, THOR & CAPTAIN AMERICA got an amazing arc in this movie. While all the remaining Avengers are used suitably.", "Everything in this flim make u so excited to the next one", "A huge production that became one of the most expensive movies of all time and with that huge budget they created something big, something superb. The movie is simply astonishing and epic, having a crew and cast filled with people that is extraordinary at their job. It's my second time watching this as I'm getting ready to see the anticipating sequel, Endgame which I believe will be better than this one. The Russo Brothers created a masterpiece in the superhero genre and will hopefully be remembered for years to come in the film industry. The visual effects are astonishing, probably the best Marvel have ever done after the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. At first I thought it didn't deserve 10/10 but after re-watching it I've to say it really does as it's incredible and the writing are actually perfect, one of the best Marvel stories to date as it's unpredictable and unique. The ensemble cast is superb, simply beyond great. Their chemistry is what makes the characters work as they show how good they work together in the fight sequences and overall at anytime. The fight sequences are perfect, giving us well choreographed fights with the characters working in ways that wouldn't be possible if there wouldn't have been a bunch of movies of them teaming up together and getting to know each other personally. Josh Brolin is the true star as the villain Thanos, a character so evil but he manages to make him a character with emotion and human, mostly for the writing but his acting and performance is special and goes down to the best villain of the Marvel movies.", "One of the great movie ever in my opinion.\nGreat plot, great villain, awesome ending.\nNo other comic based movie could come close to this.\nDefinitely waiting for the End Game.", "This movie was and is a big game changer for MCU. Avengers Endgame needs to be more than perfect.", "Incredible work by the Russo brothers, no character felt really overlooked and the movie has good paste, a good structure and plot. It's near to perfect for me. I think why this works is because this movie is mainly thanos his movie. Instead of avengers they could have based the title of the movie around thanos as well. Really well done and a very good setup for endgame (but it stands on its own as well).", "Tony Stark: \"You're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.\" Bruce Banner: \"There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?\" What.

Can not wait til Endgame!", "Avengers Infinity Wars is an excellent movie. Very well done in every way. I saw this in the theaters, and the one complaint I have is that it was hard to watch. In the opening scene, we see the ever powerful Thanos trying to get the Space Stone, while the Hulk, Thor and Loki try to stop him. They can't and so he retrieves the stone and begins his quest for the rest of the Infinity Stones. What follows it seems, is the Avengers pulling out all of the stops, trying to defeat Thanos and fighting a losing battle. Very cool, but hard to watch. Not sure, if I'll see it again. If by chance, you're one of the few people who haven't seen it, I won't give away the ending. The good news is that Captain Marvel has joined the Avengers. I'll have to see Endgame!", "The action is like nothing I have ever seen before can't wait fir endgame and whatever it takes", "Although I hated when Thanos snapped his fingers, and deleted some of our favorite characters, this movie is the beginning of the end of the infinity saga.

It knocked the wind out of me, on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I needed to know. It was very exciting and intriguing to watch them. Almost everyone started breaking into sobs while the ending happened, now, I'm not going to tell what happened, because I hate when someone spoils a film for me, so I won't do that for other people. It was intriguing, and packed full of action. It was amazing to see all the Marvel Avengers group together and reunite. Some things were completely unexpected, which made it so worth it to watch. If you haven't, watch Infinity Wars.", "I liked everything about this movie... the story was great and original.. the characters were all integrated well into the story too.. it had nice blend of emotional scenes and action... Chris Hemsworth gave one of the best performance so far of any of his movies playing Thor.. RDJ did a nice job.. the visuals were excellent... Thanos as a Marvel supervillain was fantastically portrayed by Josh Brolin.. he's fierce, menacing, and relentless... there was so much content in this movie yet it flowed perfectly from scene to scene which is not an easy feat in film making...", "This movie is teetering between PG-13 and R for how absolutely disturbing it can be (for PG-13 that is), but thats not bad. Its gripping in fact, for a super hero movie, it's just what it needs. Thanos is possibly THE best super villian to ever grace a superhero film, he isn't just someone doing it for fame, glory, wealth, or because he just loves to wreak havoc. He has a clear goal, and some of the things he does over the course of the film hurts him, and that shows how much dedication he has to doing what he thinks is right, you sometimes feel for both the villian and the hero, as it SHOULD be. Recommended, excellent.", "One of the best films of our decade. A wonderful combination of every marvel movie before it and so much more. With the best villian since Darth Vader. The action scenes are enjoyable, but none majorly stick out for being perfect. Character are great but a few feel useless (ex: Groot, vision, pretty much every GOTG)\nOverall fantastic movie not one to miss", "I was so hyped for it and I wanted to have the full experince so I went to IMAX and it WAS like a dream true, the hype was real and so amazed by the what the Russo brothers had accomplished on making a new adventures for every characters and they were all conected together by their own hands and letting the evil Thanos to get through and destroying their world, Thanos was their most fear that came true on ways they never imagined, everything was perfect the music the sense of humor even when it gets dark some times was for the greater good, in the end the work is not done yet, and I think that \"Endgame\" well be the perfect ending for the \"Infinity Saga\".", "Avengers Infinity War was the culmination of 10 years worth of hard work from Marvel Studios. Did it live up to the hype? Yes. This movie is fantastic and extremely entertaining. The movie starts of with the opening Marvel credits, but with a twist. Mysterious and eerie music plays while the Asgardian Vessel begs for mercy. Right of the bat we see how intimidating Thanos really is. The beats Hulk with ease, kills Heimdahl(butchered the name?) and crushes Loki. This is all while Thor is watching. Chris Hemsworth did a great job acting as you feel sadness and pain for Thor. I could go on and on, but I'll stick to major scenes.\nThe scene where we are introduced to Caps \"team\" is good. Caps intro was awesome! My only real complaint about this movie is Thor's side quest. The first time around it was entertaining, but after that I always skip it. It really slows down the movie-but is still a good scene.\nThe final battle was amazing! Really insane!", "The ambition alone is astonishingly crazy and a huge risk for both Marvel and Disney to really get this done and it really pulled it off so well. Great plot, amazing acting, life like CGI, beautiful visuals, great humor and writing, and most importantly the perfect villain in any super hero movie ever made", "I was erect for at least half the movie. Hulk can smash me anytime he likes.", "This simply should not have worked. Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most ambitious films in cinema history. I have so much respect for the Russo brothers for managing to make a film with this many characters and this many plot points feels cohesive and endlessly entertaining.

So many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, such a big story arc to be told in one movie (Ok, the rest is to be told 26 April 2019, but they covered a lot of ground in this one). Things that caught my attention: great performances by all the cast, real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. Laugh out loud lines. A real threat demanding great cost. Spectacular success for the Russos in a Herculean endeavour. Just really well done!

Great job by all actors and actresses", "This is by far the best superhero that has ever been made, even beating Dark Knight. In fact, even the Villain is better than the Joker. Let me say that the acting in the movie is top notch, especially where it needs to be. The look on RDJ's face, the determination on caps face when facing the army, the resolve in Thanos's eyes. The movie lacks in CGI for sure, but there is so much soul in this movie and it will make you think for days after you have seen it.\nThis movie is the high point of the MCU, how can it ever get better?", "Great movie with awesome character the only bit that I give it's the jumping between scenes", "I can definitely say this is the best movie I've ever watched. I strongly recommend it.", "I've spent over half of my life following these movies waiting for this moment, and I'm not the only one. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is probably the most ambitious project in the history of cinema, and Infinity War is part 1 of the 2 part finale (sort of). With that said, it does NOT disappoint. I have never cried so much in a theater. I have never loved an ensemble of characters so much in any art form (except possibly the comics these films are derived from), and nothing has ever inspired me more. These films are why I became a filmmaker, and you're doing yourself a great disservice if you don't see them.", "I'm not a huge over the top marvel fan by any means but I do like some of them. I loved Wonder Woman and this one as well. There were a lot of characters and storyline but I wasn't bored and was quite impressed actually. Good emotion, heart, comical moments and of course action. I liked being introduced to the Guardians of the Galaxy because I've never seen any of those movies. Overall I liked this one and was very entertained!", "Can't wait for Avengers:End Game \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\nThis movie was just amazing. Before you watch this movie, first go & watch all other Marvel movies to know each Avenger. Expectations for Avengers:End Game is much high after watching this movie", "Rarely have I watched a sequel film that fully lived up to the hype. This one did for me from the opening minute through the credit scenes.", "Such a great movie! can't wait for the new one to come out this year!!!!!!!!!", "It's all been building to this. Every movie, every new hero, every cosmic artifact and alien civilization. It's all been leading to the big showdown. And it is magnificent. The battles, the team-ups, the twists and turns, every moment of it is spectacular. This is what we've been waiting for. Infinity War wastes no time getting started. Beginning right where Ragnarok ended, it hits the ground running and never stops. The fights and the deaths start in the first scene, and momentum builds and builds from there as Thanos's plans are set into motion and the heroes rally to stop them. From New York to Wakanda to the edges of the universe the action is almost nonstop, pausing just long enough to let us catch our breath. The numerous brawls and battles are fast paced, beautifully staged and photographed, and varied enough to never get tiresome. Black Panther's climactic battle in Wakanda was awesome. Infinity War's is at least ten times better. This is also a movie brimming with character. And characters. Virtually every hero and anti-hero Marvel has introduced up to this point. No time is spent on introductions because know them already. If you don't then you have some serious catching up to do before you watch this. Chris Pratt is still as shameless, vain, and hilarious as ever as Star Lord. Tom Holland is still spouting movie references and trying to impress everyone as Spider-Man. And teen Groot is your average moody teenager, only with superpowers and a three-word vocabulary. And with all of them thrown together there are some awesome team ups. Iron Man and Doctor Strange. Spider-Man and Star Lord. Thor and Rocket Racoon! Even with so many characters in play every one of them gets their chance to shine, both in battle and with the lines they deliver. The chemistry between them all is remarkable considering that many of them have never appeared on screen together before. Of course great heroes need great villains to fight, and Infinity War delivers. Though most viewers have never heard of them, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Black Dwarf and especially the Ebony Maw make an immediate impression with their sense of menace and deadly skills. But nothing compares to Thanos himself. He's not just Marvel's most dangerous villain, he's their best. He is incredibly powerful, undeniably brilliant, and absolutely mad. Not raving lunatic or spontaneously violent mad. His madness is cold, calculating, and filled with certainty that every ounce of death and suffering he inflicts serves a higher purpose. With his power and single-minded determination, he is an absolute force of nature and watching him in battle in simply incredible. For those who worried that Marvel was getting too goofy, fear not. The tone here is as far as you can get from Ragnarok and still be in the Marvel universe.\nThe humor is still here, and it still works. There are lines that will have you laughing out loud. And thank goodness, because otherwise all the death and destruction would get DC level brooding. Infinity War is a movie that knows the value of a little comic relief, but it really knows how to be serious- even somber- when it needs to be. It can be a real emotional roller coaster, so buckle up and don't get too attached to anyone. Now I'll admit that the story is mainly there to string together the big superhero fights. That said it's pretty good, with multiple converging plot threads and a fair number of twists and turns, some of which are downright jaw dropping. Peter Dinklage's mystery appearance is better than anything we could have hoped for, but there are much more shocking reveals as characters and plot threads that were seemingly forgotten years ago reemerge. And the ending... well not everyone will be pleased, but it took guts, and it's one hell of a cliffhanger. Part two may only be a year off, but the wait is going to feel infinite.", "This movie was pact with emotional roller coaster, dry humour, visual effects and full of thrill. I wish they had an interaction between Tony and Steve but it's worth waiting for the next one. It was really interesting that they had space for each character and their significance. Their participation was as important as others. As a whole it was really awesome and I'm hyped about the sequel.", "To be honest, I've been watching these Avengers movies since I was 8 years old. It was actually the first PG-13 movie my parents let me see, afters piles of weeks of heavy convincing. I remember going to the theater with my older sister, and my friend Dylan. Over the course of these last few years, as i've grown up, my friend and I have always gone back to the movies to see the new Avengers movies that had just hit the silver screen.\nWith him almost a year ago, I saw Avengers: Infinity war. I was blown away by this movie, from the incredible acting by a star studded cast, to the plot twist at the end that will leave any person in the theater speechless. When the lights turned back on, everyone around me was either crying or their jaws were laying on the floor from being so shocked by the ending. From the astonishing editing, to the great camera work, this movie swept me off my feet.\nI usually admit whether I'm biased towards a certain something or in this case a certain franchise, but there is no need to admit being biased in this case, this was hands down of the greatest movies i've ever seen.\nThe plot of this movie is that Thanos( the most powerful Titan in the universe), is trying to get rid of half of Earth's population. The only way he can accomplish this is by retrieving all 6 infinity stones (these 6 stones are the only reason the universe is a thing, at least in this made up world). Thanos believes that our world's population is becoming too large, and killing off half our population will solve so many problems. After bombarding asgard( basically like heaven in this world) and killing almost all their people, Thanos retrieves the second out of six infinity stones. This is when he orders his army( the black order) to go to earth and retrieve 2 more stones, while he goes out into the depths of the galaxy and gets the two someone only of his power and stature could get. Meanwhile on earth, the almighty universe protectors, The Avengers, are going through a rough patch. They recently broke up( or as the hulk says, Like a band, broke up?\"). They got into a huge argument about if they wanted the Avengers to be government run or if they wanted to continue running themselves. Playboy Billionaire tony stark(or iron man) is basically retired, but is then forced to come out of retirement due to being contacted by Hugo Strange(Dr. Strange) an is told that by both him and Bruce banner(Hulk) that Thanos is coming and won't stop until he gets all six infinity stones and ends half of the living population on earth as a whole. After fighting off the Black Order from earth, Stark and 16 year old Peter Parker(Spider Man) follow a spaceship up into space to take back a kidnapped Dr. Strange and the almighty time stone he carries and protects with his life. After saving strange and killing the wizard from the Order( Ebony Maw), they crash land on Thanos's homeland, Titan. They then develop a plan to lure Thanos in and kill him. Meanwhile back on earth, the hero's from the other parts of the world keep trying to fight off the Black Order, but the Order fights back and the battle for the infinity stones commences. Who wins? You'll have to watch to find out!\nThe acting in this movie blew me away. The star studded cast (Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Josh Brolin, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, etc.) made the movie the blockbuster breaking film it was. I could really feel the sadness of when Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) had to leave his wife from earth to go and try to save the world, instead of staying behind and starting a family like he promised in the very beginning of the movie( and i'm sure before then as well).They always say great actors make movies what they are. I have to say without this all star lineup of a cast, this movie wouldn't of been close to being as good as it is. Also, I believe less people would have paid to see this movie if the movie had actors (and actresses) of a lesser caliber.\nI have to admit, i'm surprised this movie didn't take 10 years to make. I say that because I was shocked about how realistic the aliens and the other made up characters looked in this movie. I have to tip my hat to the film editors, their job was outstanding and i'm surprised they didn't recently win an oscar for best film editing at the Oscars. The perfect example is the final fight scene on Titan with some of the Avengers vs Thanos. All that camera work goes unnoticed(you'll have to see it to know what i'm talking about). The camera work in this movie was also great. In the intense action scenes, both behind the camera or behind the computer, this was one of the main reasons that i'm praising this movie.\nIf I had to compare this movie to another movie like this( not counting the other like 30 Avenger movies made), I would compare it to it's crosstown rival, Justice League. I compare Infinity war to this movie because of the similar plots and the similar use of superpowers in both stories. I also compare it to The Dark Knight Rises, because it also relates to the topic of being a superhero and protecting what you believe in. That is what I saw almost automatically when I saw this movie, and that is why I wanted to compare these movies together.\nAfter this movie, I think totally differently about movies as a whole. This movie change my way of thinking due to the fact that the ending was so shocking. ALso, in this movie, the directors and writers make you believe one thing will happen, that this movie will end like every other superhero movie ever made. But then suddenly, it totally switches, and the plot that you have been led to believe doesn't happen. Trust me, by the time the credits are rolling and the lights come back on, your eyes will be wide, and you will be shocked. This movie was spectacular in every way possible, and I can't wait for part two!", "Best movie from Marvel! Can't stop watching it. Just Brilliant!", "I recommend \"Avengers Infinity War\" because unlike other movies it shows that you should fight for what you believe in and to keep the things you love close. Another reason to watch this is because even though this has more of a serious and detrimental like tone/topic, it encompasses humor into the movie.\nThe movie \"Avengers Infinity War\" is a movie created by Marvel. Marvel continues the story of the first movie, Avengers. In this movie it shows how the hero's fight for their beliefs at all cost as well as fighting for others and their safety. This film has a relatively young and energetic cast that displays the connection and expressions of the hero's very well. The story of this movie is the hero's trying to stop the notorious Thanos and his dreams of destroying half the Earth for a result of world peace.\nI've seen all the Marvel movies and many more and i recommend you to watch this movie because of how it shows the will power they show of fighting for hope and the safety of others no matter what comes their way. I like how it shows this theme in not only some parts of the movie but throughout the whole movie. This cast does a good job of showing and emphasizing what their character believes in and has close to their hearts. They show this in the movie by fighting this superior being (THANOS) for the safety of the people on Earth even though all odds are against them.\nAnother reason why i recommend this movie is because it has a way its own way to include humor and joy even though this movie has a serious tone to it due to what is at stake and the results that could happen if they failed to do their job. Thanos is a superior being who is known for destroying planets in order to get what he wants and desires, the Avengers are known as Earth's trusty protectors. They were just meant to meet and have a battle. In this serious circumstance they have moments that inflict comedy and ways to show that in dark times we have ways to give others hope and comfort.\nOverall i think this movie was great to watch and a movie that i think you would enjoy if you are a marvel fan and like action packed movies. I recommend this movie if you have seen all the marvel movies so that you are able to see the smaller details and so that you have a better understanding of the movie. I can't wait for the second part of the movie, \"Avengers End Game\".", "I always love popcorn movies with deep reflections on real problems. And Avengers: Infinity War is, IMO, not THE best, but one of the best Marvel movies ever made. If you want to know, I think Captain American: Winter Soldier is the best in MCU. Let's take away the grand world and fancy effects, this is a movie about a very serious social problem: booming population and limited resources. How do we choose to solve this problem does not make us a villain. It just makes us humans. It also brings the question that does ends justify the means. If you really think about it, this movie has more to offer. Infinity War builds an epic world. It introduces us to the entire Marvel Universe. It also builds an epic \"Villain\". Thanos, after seeing him in previous easter eggs, I worried he was going to be a classic villain with no humanity. But he's not. In Infinity War, Thanos is a human. He has his background, he has his value. The fact that he only kills to bring balance to the Universe after his world was destroyed indicates that he has human feelings and he wants to solve the unsolvable problem. Most importantly, he has the terribly strong will to act on it. This makes him one of the most well built \"Villain\" in history. Music, scenes, battles are pretty well designed in this movie. And the shocking ending really gives us huge anticipations for the sequel.", "The Russo Bros. Inc. have done a three for three! What a nearly perfect movie they have delivered. Unfortunately for those of us who have been reading comics for 40+ years, we have to deal with those without the knowledge of how epic a movie this is. What a superb job they did in melding this large group into a movie that is in most parts, seamless. Like Age of Ultron, the more I watch this movie, the better it gets. It is brutal in the death of Loki, it is humorous in Stark, Starlord and Spidey's quips. It is heart wrenching in Gamora's sacrifice. It is devestating in Thanos' victory. Action packed and a thrill ride of a movie with substance. With my opinion worth a grain of salt, near perfection. Sit back, pop some popcorn and enjoy. Personally, Winter Soldier is still my favorite, but only by an inch and narrowing with each watch.", "17 movies in the Marvel universe were the setup, and now \"Infinity War\" is the ultimate payoff. Marvel leaves your classic superheroes and their quests behind and rapidly plunges into a much darker story of ultimate sacrifice that is much more deep than any before, the quest of Thanos. \"Infinity War\" is the story of Thanos and his journey to collect 6 infinity stones, gems that possess incredible power with no equal. If he succeeds he can wipe half of all life from the universe with the snap of his fingers, Thanos' idea of how to create ultimate peace. By lowering the population in a mass genocide, everything wrong such as poverty, hunger, and all else can be solved with a new mass abundance of resources that will create ultimate peace, but it takes the ultimate cost. The protagonists we have all come to love or hate so far must join from across the stars in a effort to stop Thanos to save them all. Failure would be catastrophic. That's just the plot. The movie truly shines in its use of character building, comic relief, and it omnipresent themes of family and sacrifice. To see jaw dropping effects and environments, characters unfold within astonishing action scenes of heroism, and to see them also suffer from their previous mistakes which haunt them makes for an astounding spectacle to behold. Trust me when I say, 'You don't want to miss this one.' \nThe characters in the movie have been kept greatly the same and you can still see them change in their changing environments, which is amazing. I really love to see what MARVEL will do with each new instalment into the franchise and now we finally get our first pay-off. We can see all of are beloved heros and villian come together and it's just amazing to watch and awe at. To see all the characters come together for a massive battle made me really giddy sitting there in the theater. It moved me to the edge of my seat, but that's the surface of it, the plot. Each character has their own outstanding personality and they interact with others in there own way, and that makes me love this movie even more. Characters aren't just along for the ride, they all show who they are and that attention to detail in every moment is truly an amazing piece of work. Personalities are not glossed over for action, but expressed upon and even bring out new themes that wouldn't have been apparent such as family and loss as mentioned before. Another major point with their personality is the comic relief, and it wouldn't be MARVEL without it. The characters are funny, and not just filler for a boring plot. The jokes don't take away from the quality, they only add to it. This is different in a good way compared to many others. Even in solo sections or in scenes where multiple people are together, the personality of each character is very apparent. Star Lord, Spider-man, and many others keep their quips and charm and even others provide wanted humor just from their bluntness or lack of awareness make for a funny moment or two. Its funny to see characters meet each other and express that. I would write a joke, but I'm keeping spoiler friendly here. I just want to express how they creators crafted them together and it doesn't feel fake or needed. It perfectly placed and I'm glad to have it. Another key difference and major change in this movie is the main character. No it's not one of the heroes, but the villain Thanos. This movie focuses on his journey, his quest, his goals, his regrets, not anyone else. Sure they develop the other characters, but he's the focus. Now don't make the mistake of thinking that he's the protagonist, but he still is focused on. It's a super enticing idea. This makes for a really interesting impact on the movie as a whole too. It subverts expectations and feels exiting to the audience since no-one else does this and no-one else has ever before. (At least not really) This just adds to the ever building pile of greatness for this movie. \nTo conclude, this movie is truly spectacular. I've never seen and probably will never see anything like it again. Years of work and detail to smash into an ultimate plot, impossible twists and surprises, great story and characters, a villain as the main character, intense ideas and themes, they all make this movie an all time great. There have been movies with similar elements before, a villainous main character such as Maleficent (but not really), great action scenes like many others such as movies like Star Wars or The Dark Knight, great themes of bonding and sacrifice, but none before now have put them all together. All MARVEL fans can appreciate this movie, and you can even if your new. You can see this movie by itself and still be blown away, though I recommend watching the others so you understand who everybody is. I can't recommend this movie enough. I could ramble on about it all day and night, but the main point here is you'll never see anything like it, and you don't want to miss out. You need to see Infinity War, and you won't regret it.", "I have been watching Marvel movies for a while now, and I can pridefully say that this sequel might be my favorite. All of the movies in the MCU, which has been developing for the past decade, have lead up to Avengers: Infinity War and its second part, and I can confidently say that this is the first Marvel movie to make me sit at the edge of my seat while it delivers its beautiful expositional plot full of twists and turns that are quite uncommon in the genre. The film is able engage its audience by not just describing the consequences, but by actually acting on them. This is the first time that we have seen our beloved protagonists fight for something that holds real value, as opposed to the fake repercussions that were described but didn't actually hold a presence in past movies. For example, in the original Avengers, we are expected to be panicking or wondering about how our heroes could possibly beat these \"all-powerful\" aliens from another world. However, in a similar format to most of Marvel's past releases, the heroes find a way to beat the villains, and while it is depicted as though there was a substantial struggle, in hindsight, the Avengers were able to beat the villains in a simplistic and rather easy way. The Avengers were going to win from the start, and while this wholesomeness might be fun for many people, I believe that it is very negative for the plot, and I think that it makes the storytelling too stale. In contrast, the new addition features many of our admired characters facing grave outcomes for their failures or shortcomings. For example, we see a key character from one of Marvel's largest franchises, Gamora, die at the hands of Thanos, and this is very beneficial for the story because of all of the characterization she had gone through in other movies she has been featured in, which makes her death especially sorrowful and sad. Another character that dies is Loki. Throughout the series of movies, I, personally, have come to really like the character. He is first introduced as the central villain in the first Avengers, and in later iterations as a recurring character that brings comedic relief in the movies, and he his character arc from a villain to a mischievous and playful person is very entertaining. Surprisingly, however, he dies in \"Infinity War\" while trying to assassinate Thanos, and it really comes as a shock because, as I said before, these kinds of fatalities have never really occurred to such an important character in the MCU. Thanks to these sacrifices the film made by letting a few characters, who had received considerable and extensive development in their characterization perish in return for a more immersive and rich narrative. For instance, the world in this continuation seems a lot more realistic and appealing due to it being much more believable, in regards to the characters facing true obstacles that greatly threaten them. Simply because of the world and narrative in Avengers: Infinity War, I have fallen in love with it, and I believe it to be a brilliant movie that is a fresh take on the genre of superhero action, and I would recommend it for people who like action movies like Justice League or the Star Wars series, or just for people who want an entertaining experience on a night out.", "Knowingly or unknowingly the team have built a stronger and reasonable THANOS.I don't know a way to think how could they break him down in ENDGAME , if suppose happened it would be by showing much greater villain (aaw!wait he ain't a villain, right)...", "This movie is just mindblowing, epic, spectacular and funny all at once!!", "This film is better then I could have ever imagined", "Already watched more than 10 times waiting for endgame now", "Don't Listen To These liars! This is movie of the year contender!", "This movie is just insane! No words! I can't wait for Avengers: endgame!", "Wow. Just wow. The cgi and colours are amazing. The mega arcs by all of the movies are amazing. But captain america could have been in more.", "Well made movie bringing together last 10 years of MCU , well written and directed.", "It was incredible this movie.\nThe Thanos, in my opinion, the best villain ever.", "Awesome, just awesome! I especially liked the special effects...", "There is nothing bad in this movie. This movie is spectacular. Enough said.", "Throughout this movie everything is unrealisticly biased against Thanos and his crew. One second Thanos twitches his hand and disarms any threat as if hes flicking away a bug on his arm, the next second hes completelly incapable of defending himself or use the same powers. Same story with the rest of his crew. The CGI could be better especially for Thanos as he walks as a cartoon caracter almost howering above ground weightless, but overall great! The story is interesting but couldve been more spicyvalthough easy to follow and entertaining and the acting is great as is the sound and music. Only thing bad about this flick is the political message and social engineering through its bias in story and acting. Its not overwhelming as in the racist flicks of Black Panther or as sexist as Captain Marvel but its there.\nYou know how the follow up will end thanks to this bias making everything Marvel produce annoyingly predictible and booring.", "This film is so long and large that you don't know what's going on!\nYou've got so many characters each doing different things at different places. You really have to have a blank mind to really concentrate on this. It's definitely for a Marvel fan but be ready to have so many questions they could build a hulk buster!", "I was extatic through the whole movie!\nHad to see it 2 times in the cinema!!!\nThors moment was..... explosive!", "Infinity War Review (10/10)\nAvengers Infinity War is a lot, but in a good way. Marking the passing of a decade since the conception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Infinity War acknowledges that Marvel's audience has grown up. There's a seemingly hopeless amount of characters packed into this story, but the Russo brothers make the bold decision to establish big bad Thanos as the primary protagonist, and the film is all the better for it.\nThe film is very fast paced in the beginning but then it smoothes it's self out and slows. The insane amount of action and characters means that not everybody gets enough screen time, but most make an impact on the story, in some form or another. Some of the new relationships and conflicts work extraordinarily well - Doctor Strange and Tony Stark make for pitch-perfect rivals, and Star Lord's gut-wrenching jealousy toward the sculpted, hyper-masculine Thor is hilarious.\nEvery single member of the team tries their utmost to prevent the apocalypse, and occasionally, even come infuriatingly close to overpowering Thanos. But it's never quite enough, and one important distinction between Thanos and the Avengers is repeatedly highlighted - our heroes are emotional creatures, unwilling to sacrifice their friends for the greater good, while Thanos is stone cold.\nThe final act, including the post-credits sting, brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. Infinity War is the first half of the final installment in the series, and it concludes with a premonition of finality. Its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual, unmarvelous world.\nUltimately, Infinity War is a great film and one for the ages. This movie goes right into the top 5 of MCU movies and it just might be in the top 5 of all comic book movies. I recommend seeing this movie on the biggest possible screen, to experience it in it's full glory.", "Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. This movie keeps what the mcu have been promising for years.", "Whether you like Super Hero movies or not, this is a classic. Can't wait for the next one.", "I just dont have words to describe . I would say best hollywood multistarrer ever.", "Avengers: Infinity War is absolutely everything that every comic book film ever wanted. It had the action, humor, and heartbreaking scenes of their favorite characters died in the film, and I can't tell you who dies in the film. I really enjoyed Part 1 of Infinity War, but If you have not see Avengers: Infinity War, go see it. And don't miss one post credit scene. It might surprise the audience. Thanos will return", "It's difficult to codify something like Avengers: Infinity War (2018) without including everything that led up to it. In reality, it's probably more along the lines of the 19th episode of a television series that's taken ten years to realize fully. Because of the interconnected nature of these previous movies, it's difficult to view it alone without the backstory tied to it. However, there are enough brief moments of exposition to help most people fill in the gaps as to what is happening. Still, as is the case with many finales for television shows, the epic nature of Infinity War is at a level all its own. The scale of such an endeavor is daunting, but with as little backstory as possible holding it back, Infinity War moves at a pretty good pace, jumping between a couple of groups of Avengers. Of course, we can't just directly jump to fighting the main villain, so the \"lesser\" bad guys stand in the way for a moment, but mostly fill time until the penultimate battles. At least during this waiting period, we get to learn the motivations of the heretofore mostly mysterious Thanos (Josh Brolin), which ends up humanizing this terrifying villain who thinks he's doing the right thing. While the action is probably a little too shaky at times, the team-ups are what sell this movie. No longer are there coy little cameos and winking nods to references from other Marvel films (although, there is a somewhat shocking cameo about half-way through), but instead full-blown connections that expertly ties up the disparate parts of the 18 previous films. With an ending as shocking as this one, I'm a little curious where Marvel goes from here, but I have my hunches about what the future will bring. An ambitious project that deftly delivers on its many promises, I give Avengers: Infinity War 4.5 stars out of 5.", "Infinity War is a fine summation of the MCU so far.\nThanos is the best enemy, he has reason and motivation in his destruction. Josh Brolin was the best choice for his voice.\nEvery hero has his/her part in this movie.\nThe worst thing about it was the end, the movie has a very good cliffhanger, i can't wait for the second part.\nIf you are a superhero or comic fan it is a must see movie, but to understand it, you have to watch every MCU movie from the begining (until Black Panther).", "Esse \u00e9 um dos melhores filmes de her\u00f3is em minha opini\u00e3o", "I have followed the MCU and its characters all the way through ten years, and was never so pumped when I sat down in my red pluche chair in front of an IMAX screen. My expectations were met, and sometimes even blown apart; this is one of the most emotional and thrilling movies I have ever seen, and one of Marvel's best works. Acting: The core players in the form of Robert Downey Jr. , Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johansson are all in excellent shape, each providing a strong performance with the traces of ten years of film on all of them. Not every one of them has a compelling arc (it is hard to say if you can even call arcs in this, since it is essentially part one) but they all have their own glorious moments. The newer players like Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Chadwick Boseman and Anthony Mackie are just as good, and just like the core Avengers, some are more compelling than others, each one having their bright moments. The Guardians are an interesting bunch; because the teams are so vastly different in style and personality, it is fun to watch these weird guys play off against \"normal people\" from earth. They all do a great job, particulary Zoe Saldana in one of her best performances yet. The one who truly stands out above everyone else however, is Josh Brolin himself as Thanos: the motion capture, while not flawless, is ridiculously impressive and brings an essential humanity and vulnerability to what is essentially a genocidal maniac. He is aside from Killmonger perhaps the best villain yet to come out of the MCU. Direction:\nThe Russo Brothers once again deliver a visceral and tense experience that carried over from Winter Soldier and Civil War, while equally providing intimate and soft emotional moments, balanced out by hilarious quips. Where they fail however, is handling the Guardians just as good as James Gunn. Their scenes often feel vastly different from the rest of the movie, and sometimes like a sore thumb, not nearly as funny as under the original director. Cinematography:\nTrent Opaloch, who worked with the Russo's on Civil War and Winter Soldier, has brought his A-game to this movie, not just filming action in a visceral and intense way, but also composing beautiful(digital) imagery filled with characters in their most challenging moments. Plot:\nWhile this movie is essentially a giant third act, it delivers greatly on entertainment and thrills, with each group of characters having an interesting plotline, culminating in fantastic battle scenes and an ending that will leave you in shock for hours to come. The pacing is quite breakneck, but never bothering. Music:\nAlan Silvestri returns as the composer from the first Avenger movie, and while the score is not quite as rousing and fantastic as in 2012, there are great themes present, with the emotional scenes drawing nearly all their strength from these beautifully composed pieces. Editing:\nConsidering that the construction of this movie took ten years, it is quite a miracle that it flows all so cohesively and smooth within two and a half hours. The \"big scene\" transitions are especially effective. Sound:\nNot particulary noteworthy, but by no means bad. Many sounds don't stand out. VFX:\nThis movie has a LOT of CGI, some executed brilliantly, some looking quite unfinished. The CGI for Thanos embodies this duality to the fullest. In the end, the nomination for an Academy Award is understandable, but not deserved. Production Design:\nWhile a lot of it is blue screen, the atmosphere and scale of every location is carried over well, and you can't help but be impressed with every setpiece. Costume/Make-up\nAll the heroes come together in their signature outfits, with some nice new additions like the Iron Spider and the Wakandan tribes. Not much different from what we've already seen though. Action:\nThe action in this movie, while mostly digital, is spectacular in pretty much every sequence, and there are a lot of moments were your jaw will just drop in awe because of the massive scale and sheer awesomeness. Tone:\nFrom the first five minutes, it becomes clear that this is the darkest and most serious MCU movie yet, and that the stakes have never been higher. The feeling of dread and danger never leaves, and when the blood starts flowing, you feel every death carving a mark on your soul. The humor, while genuinely funny, feels half the time out of place, and particulary the scenes with the guardians feel like they belong in a different movie. General Concensus:\nA massive blockbuster that Marvel can be most proud of, and while it can't represent each character in the smoothest way, it's scale and gargantuan action completely blows that flaw away, aided by great chemistry from the cast, a compelling villain and an absolutely shocking ending. 8.6/10", "Perfect movie\nThe best movie in 2018\nThe best movie in MCU\nThanos, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor and everyone in movie was a great", "Everyone in here partying it up.

Thanos is a terrifying villain which you dread seeing because you know once you see him, something bad is going to happen and there will be major consequences. Groups are split up and sent on different missions but are all for the same goal. The characters we know and love aren't really developed anymore considering they've already been developed before, but the most development comes in Thanos who for a CG character who is trying to murder half the universe, is a sympathetic character who thinks he's right. The acting is brilliant, standout being Josh Brolin as Thanos who makes the character feel real. The visual effects are mind-blowing as everything feels so real, it should feel goofy and ridiculous but it isn't. The music is decent but nothing mind-blowing the Avengers theme is a nice touch to hear often. The movie sometimes struggles in terms of cutting back and forth between many characters. It is a nitpick as it basically juggles all the characters perfectly. Expectations are subverted, all your awful theories are wrong as Marvel is very creative and utilizes it's advantage in having many movies before this one. It was worth the 10 year wait.", "Great story. Great build up. Thanos as the complex civilian was great. Great CGI. Great fight scenes. Just a great movie", "Avengers: Infinity War is a movie we have never seen before. Having been 10 years in the making Infinity War does not disappoint! There is so much going on in this movie that you will have to see it at least twice! The action is fantastic, the special effects are amazing, & the pacing is perfect. Just when you think \"It's been awhile since I've seen....\" they bring them right back into the action. Every Marvel film has led to this. While it does end with an amazing cliffhanger, it's going to keep us on the hook desperately waiting for Avengers 4. Acting standouts are Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Robert Downy Jr., Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, & Josh Brolin. Not that anyone else wasn't good, these were just the people we saw the most. I CAN NOT WAIT till the next one!!!!", "I love this movie not quite perfect but would rate it a 9.5 if I could love the villain probably my favorite villain in a movie and one of my favorite endings of all time", "Watching this movie is very enjoyable. Collecting actors and very popular characters are the reasons for the success of \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"", "WOW! No wonder any movie related to any avengers character would be a guarantee box office!! Every character has his own charm. The computer graphic is so over the top!! Well done~", "The Marvel Cinematic Universe has changed cinema. Since Iron Man in 2008, Marvel have been constantly adding to this universe, slowly building up to the biggest cinematic crossover of all time. Everyone is in this. The Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and some other characters (Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Wong, etc.) This itself is a huge feat, and the fact that Infinity War is as good as it is is a testament to the Russo's skills. The story is that a Titan called Thanos wants to collect all six Infinity Stones, each containing a power. When he collects all six, he can snap his fingers and wipe out half of all life in the universe. The Avengers find out about this, and set out to stop him. The big twist is that they fail. For the first time in a superhero movie, the heroes lose, and the villain wins. He gets the stones and kills 50% of the universe, including a lot of the main characters, like Spider-Man and Black Panther. This is impressive, because you go into these movies expecting a couple of hours of action, then a nice resolution at the end. The way The Decimation is filmed is great too; there's no music for the entire scene, and the camera lingers on all these beloved heroes fading away. It's beautiful and depressing, and if you don't know the Marvel schedule (Spider-Man, Black Panther, and the Guardians all have movies coming out in the next few years) it's traumatic. Everything else about Infinity War is great too. The visuals have really improved, only a couple of years ago was there some controversy over the fact that many Marvel films look \"dull\" and \"bland\", but this movie is beautiful. It's so colourful in the action sequences, so dark in the Decimation scene, the use of colour really adds to the movie in a big way. Another common complaint about the MCU has been that there's no memorable music, but Infinity War once again fixes this issue by having a genuinely great soundtrack, topped off perfectly with the Avengers main theme. The writing, acting, and fight sequences are all great too, which I've come to expect for these movies, but seeing all these characters together in the same film is amazing, and probably the biggest draw card. Overall, Infinity War is incredible. My favourite movie of 2018, my favourite MCU movie, and possibly my favourite movie of all time. Go see it.", "Increndible movie. So important for the next history end game.", "The rhythm is a bit bad, especially the garbage of the Galaxy, which is stirred up in the middle of the mess, let's die quickly. In the end, the close-ups of eliminating hegemony are too short to fully show the complexity of picking up everything but getting what you want. This is one of them. How can Hollywood always deal with the third part of the series now?", "If you haven't seen this movie your mad. The ending will send chills down your spine and will see you racing back to the cinema for the sequel. The whole movie from start to finish is absolutely incredible.", "Idk how many times I've watched this movie. I just cant get enough of it. It's now my fav movie of all time... Waiting for \"End Game\" so badly.. This movie is just love. If you haven't watched it then what on earth are you doing!", "The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been going strong for a full decade now. The superhero film genre has never been bigger as it is right now. Sure superhero films have existed for decades (even way back in the 1960s with Batman), but only one would come out once every few years. In the first half of 2018 alone, we have had Black Panther, Deadpool 2, and Avengers: Infinity War. With all of these films from this specific genre, fatigue has started to set in. Superhero films follow this archetype: average person falls victim to a mystical force that gives them superpowers; hubris of someone they know causes them to get similar powers of their own so they become a villain that the good guy could easily beat; forced deadpan jokes and an extensive use of CGI plague the rest of the film for well over two hours. Ensemble superhero films (i.e. The Avengers) follow this formula: a mega-villain tries to destroy the world so the assembled good guys team up and fight back with a tremendous amount of CGI and forced humour. Seeing these traits again and again will sooner than later leave audiences wanting a refreshing change. Predictability is all-too present now. Luckily, the third instalment of The Avengers breaks this monotonous motion. It seemed as though it wanted to start a new trend in the superhero genre. The tenth anniversary of the cinematic universe seems like the perfect time to do so. Right away, the film opens up with the villain--Thanos (played exceptionally by Josh Brolin)--laying a beating on Thor, Hulk and Loki after getting an Infinity Gem and ready to get more. This opening has some heroes in trouble and the villain easily getting the upper hand on them. While most of the MCU villains has attitude and are cool to see, not many of them pose a real threat toward the villain. We know that the good guys need to remember something crucial or use a little extra force to destroy the villain. Judging from how easy Thanos had his romp, one question will cloud the minds of those that watch the film: \"how are the Avengers able to defeat that thing?\" This baffling question remains throughout the film. The wonderment will keep the viewer entranced. New Marvel superheroes joining the Avengers are Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Spiderman (now portrayed by Tom Holland), as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy. The combination both teams works quite well. The teamwork and friction between the factions increase doubt to how Thanos will be overtaken. But at the same time, the writing between the teams is so well done, we want to see them working together and their journeys to victory. The minor flaw in this would be that there are too many characters and too many backstories to follow. So this may require multiple viewings. Anything wrong with that? Not at all. Avenger: Infinity War also takes itself more seriously which is something I am personally very happy for. The jokes and punchlines are forced way too much and the deadpan nature makes it worse. That is almost completely gone here. Then there is how deep all the characters are. All of them face doubt, but they know they must save the day. And Thanos actually has justifiable motives. While we want the good guys to win, we hope nothing too bad will happen to Thanos. When was this last time a villain in a superhero movie was developed this well? As usual, the action and special effects are amazing. But since the amount of humanity is at an unusual high this time around, the violent scenes seem more intense because there is so much stuff on the line. This darker sequel to the 2012 blockbuster is a true sight to behold. The darkness is a nice change of pace that is needed to spice things up. And the use of depth and humanity are two things every great movie in history needs. Infinity War certainly has them. Everything in this are just in calling Infinity War a masterpiece as well as one of the best superhero films ever. 4/4 stars", "Great film with plenty of action, adventure and did i mention action packed ? . Yes this is a film for the saturday night roster enjoy", "Lost for words. This movie is simply amazing.. The cliffhanger...the thrill of it all!", "2018's best, the russo's have done it yet again, recommend to comic fans and anyone who knows these characters", "I cannot emphasise how good this movie is. It's ridiculously brilliant. The plotting, pace, script, acting, FX. The screen time given to each, of what must be the biggest ensemble of A List stars ever, is nothing short of miraculous.\nThe film is above and beyond the usual superhero fare, the villain, Thanos, is expertly envisioned, played and brought to life by Josh Brolin and is quite possibly the best movie villain ever.\nAs you can imagine, I am biased. I obviously love the genre but that's irrelevant. Before this movie came along, the 1933 version of King Kong was my favourite movie. It may still be when the Marvel Cinematic Universe runs its course but this movie, at the moment, is at No 1.\nHow on earth can Avengers: Endgame top it?", "The End is Near... Or is it? The long awaited Superhero event of all time is finally here! The full might of the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes full Circle as the superheroes of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy team up to take on their greatest enemy ever. The Mad Titan Thanos! But does this film live up to its decade long hype? Read on to find out... Plot: Avengers: Infinity War is set at least 3 years after Captain America: Civil War. The Avengers are scattered and divided. Tony Stark (Iron Man) and his team continue to fight under the governments wishes. While Steve Rogers (Captain America) and his team are in hiding in Wakanda operating freely in the shadows. All the while, the Titan warlord Thanos is on a quest to retrieve the infinity stones with Earth and it's heroes in his sights. After the Hulk supposedly crash lands back on Earth, he warns Tony and the Avengers about the coming threat. If Thanos finds all the Infinity Stones, he will have the ability to control the fate of the Universe at his fingertips. With the help of Doctor Strange, Spider-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy, The Avengers will attempt to stop Thanos at any cost. The Likes Well here we go. The big unveiling. First off, IT WAS AWESOME! Better than clunky Age of Ultron! Sorry. Was that too short of an explanation? Okay, I'll run you through the long version. Avengers: Infinity War is the combination of all your favourite Marvel super heroes coming together to fight a common foe in a very emotional, risk taking story that fuels you're anticipation to the max. First off, the action sequences in Avengers Infinity War are literally the best I've ever seen in a Superhero movie to date. Every sequence is perfectly filmed, edited and performed so well that you can almost feel you are literally seeing a comic book panel come to life. The locations and cinematography are immensely improved, we get a much more needed look on Wakanda, we get to see new planets. We got some massive space-ships. Seriously, we get so much cool new things in this movie. The story is balanced, unpredictable, heartfelt and well-written into the source and characters involved. Even the villian Thanos himself isn't afraid to make his motives clear unlike Ultron before him. And you find that everything he says and everything you see him do carry's a much more humanised villain, even for Thanos being an alien. And with Josh Brolin behind the scenes portraying this Mad Titan, you couldn't have gotten a much better choice of an actor! My absolute favourite thing about this movie is how well the characters from across the MCU interacted with each other. From Thor and Rocket Racoon embarking on a perilous journey to fix his hammer, Iron-Man and Doctor Strange's clash of science over magic, Star-Lord trying to mimic Thors accent and diss on Iron-Man's plan. And my favourite, Groot meeting Captain America back on Earth. Where he says the usual \"I Am Groot\" catchphrase and Cap goes \"I'm Steve Rogers\" without care. It's all brilliantly inserted. SPOILER AHEAD!! Did the Avengers win? Nope, Sorry the Avengers lost, big time... WAH WAH. As many had predicted, Thanos had won and finally succeeded in his plan to annihilate half the Universe. Along with the many Avengers who'd died fighting to stop him. But as far as that spoiler goes I am NOT going to tell any of you who we lost in the movie, but I'm telling you right now, a lot of them die in this story. But likely they'll all come back from the dead in some kind of Death of Superman resurrection plotline or something. So don't give your hopes up just yet! The Dislikes Now I think you already know what I'm going to say on this and yes you are right. It's the long running time. A problem that beats down upon Marvel films like a drum. But it's not actually as bad as some might be made to believe. As mentioned above, you get so much wonderful and exciting things happening at every turn of the movie you can so easily ignore it. But because this is a massive crossover story we're seeing here with so many characters and personalities clashing, the running time is both a blessing and a curse. The large amount of characters in the movie can confuse the primary focus of the film at times between acts. First it follows Thor and Hulk, Then Iron-Man, Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, then Thanos, then to the Guardians of the Galaxy, then to Captain Americas Avengers and the list goes on... There is just no true point of view at all for us to follow through. Overall, it just feels almost like a 3 hour long crossover episode of Arrow where the focus shifts too fast. The Verdict With this history making film breaking more box-office records than the first Avengers movie alone, Infinity War lives up to every expectation on the list. You have all your favourite Marvel characters (except for the X-Men, Deadpool or Fantastic Four, Agents of Shield and Daredevil's Avengers), you have visually breath-taking sequences, sensible storytelling and heart stopping drama, a well-portrayed villain, many moments of thrills and suspense at every moment makes Infinity War the best Avengers sequel yet!\nBut as far as this goes, will its direct sequel in 2019 also be able to live-up to the same expectations witnessed in this one? Only time will tell. But for now, Infinity War is the greatest superhero mash-up for the ages.

The tone and feel of this movie is matchless when comparing to other MCU movies. No other movie in this universe so greatly portrays what you're supposed to feel through this movie. The dark and eerie feel portrayed through the coloration of the movie and the music helps put you in the mood you're supposed to be in. They also throw in great comic relief throughout. Every single detail and aspect of this movie is so well thought. The Russo Brothers succeeded very well with this.

Some things just seemed unlikely or like the easiest way to make the plot continue the way they wanted it to. \nNot once I got emotional or felt surprised.

Also it wasn't clear to me why some of the known characters didn't use their powers and abilities to full potential and what the Infinity Stones, besides 2 of them, exactly do. Maybe it's just to tease us for following movies.", "This was a fun film and a great achievement on behalf of the scriptwriters to give at least some dialogue to all of the 1,563 superheroes in the film, even if at times it felt like the real title should have been \"Thor: Infinity War\". I do believe though that they could have kept the secret of whether those that vanished come back a little longer.", "This movie is everything and more of what we fans waited for. Not many movies make you feel bad for the antagonist, but this truly did. Amazing plot. Amazing story. Amazing way to top the check board that has been rising for years and years. Marvel, you have done it again!", "After 10 years of the current era of the Marvel universe, 'Avengers: Infinity War' marks the beginning of the end for the stories of many of the characters we've grown attached to throughout multiple film entries. What else can you expect but a gargantuan cast that brings together nearly every single major superhero and supporting character? It's difficult to keep track of everyone in 'Infinity,' as different factions team up with each other, whether it's the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' crew splitting up with the likes of Thor and Doctor Strange or members of the original Avengers crew heading to Wakanda for a last stand of sorts to protect an infinity stone, everything is all over the map. But regardless of where our heroes are physically in the universe, they are united in their mission to defeat big bad guy Thanos before he can wipe out 50% of all living things in the universe. Despite the obvious bloating that 'Infinity' experiences, the film works very well. It feels as grand as it's billed, and lives up to the hype. There's plenty of material here, from the stylized action sequences we come to expect from Marvel fare to humorous banter between the old friends - and some new ones - when everyone crosses paths. In this sense, 'Infinity' feels more like a space opera than it does your typical superhero blockbuster. There's also an ominous tone that 'Infinity' takes on as it becomes clear that the situation is dire, and it's a hard pill to swallow when events transpire, including the final moments of the film that leave many breathless. One of the few criticisms of the film is that it moves too quickly - the story could have unfolded much better as a Netflix series, but of course the filmmakers did what was necessary to get it to an appropriate runtime. The Russo brothers deserve much credit for being able to tame this beast of a movie, and it's likely that 'Avengers: Endgame' will be a must see when it hits theaters in April.", "One of the best of the Avengers movies. It felt like we actually dove into the the plot and lived through it with the characters on screen. Looking forward to Avengers End Game.", "Great action movie. I love it to watch. I watch it on Amazon Prime and the movie is so marvelous to watch.", "To be honest, with 10 years worth of movies backing this movie, it makes it hard for newcomers if this was your first movie, but the Russos did an amazing job on this movie \"yes it works!\" Amazing color, actors, story(though doesn't follow the Infinity Gauntlet comics at all), design, BGM.\nEvery scene in this movie screams \"epic\" !\nNuff said. Pretty sure everyone has seen it by now...", "The most different film i have ever seen among Marvel movies.", "I watched Infinity War for the third time, and the first at home on my television. The impact was no less than in the theater. It is a sprawling epic, made contextually satisfying if you have seen the lead-up Marvel films going into it. The characters are familiar yet evolved. Tom Holland as the teenage Spider-Man is especially refreshing as both new hero and fanboy. But most attention goes to Josh Brolin's motion-captured Thanos, a villain who is formidable, but engaging; evil but charismatic. No punches are pulled in the finale of this installment, leaving most exhausted and introspective. It affects more than a comic book adaptation should. My personal wish is that this was the end - no more sequels - as what a story it would be.", "I gotta say this is one of the best super hero movie so far. I watched this movie 6 times in Cinema. And I even bought the Bluray to see it again. All cast did amazing job the writing and direction is super. Cant wait for next title", "Ok, don't get me wrong I did like this movie, it was fairly good, BUT I'm not sure it deserves to be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. Yes it was dramatic and better than a lot of marvel films I've seen. Good special effects as always and some really nice views, but I wouldn't call this top 250 worthy. The ending is honestly pretty predictable and honestly very stupid, Thanos literally could've just used the gauntlet to make more food instead of killing off half the universe. It's just a cliche and stupid ending. I do think it'll be cool to see what happens in the next movie though, still ending was just bad, even if it's not the technical \"end\" still over all it was decent, and worth watching.", "Many years ago amblin did this trick in E.T where they intentionaly\nkilled the character and got impressionable young children crying\nas an way to say you thought we killed him Fooled you and brought\nhim back towards the climax of the film and now both disney and\nmarvel exects have done it with infinity war by trolling the audiences\nwith fake deaths of treasured heroes when it's quite clear that Sam\nL Jackson already teased about the climax of Endgame about Captain\nMarvell is going to bend time the same trick was used in salkinds\nsuperman where the titular character reversed time to prevent current\nevents from taking place because of generating concerns and complaints\nof parents that thier children is deeply upset and the all the avengers will\nreturn along with the rest of the guardians team going forward to guardians\nof the galaxy vol 3 that's currently on hold and what i have seen about this\nmovie via reviews on youtube i can't deeply recommend this to young children\nboth kevin feige and marvel should be ashamed for toying on peoples emmotions..", "Finally watched Marvel's \"Avengers: Infinity War\" this weekend. Oh, snap! Sorry, Sorry. Terrible joke. Couldn't resist. Anyway, as someone who's not such a big fan of the Marvel films, I found this movie unexpectedly thrilling! My only complaint was that the REMAINING HALF of the Marvel cast didn't ALSO die! No no, but seriously folks, I enjoyed this film far more than I thought I would. Infinity War is both a thrilling tragedy and a sublime joke - Marvel trolling their own audience, entertaining Marvel skeptics like me by letting the bad guy win, and killing-off many of their most beloved heroes (even if it's all only for now). The fact that it works, and feels like it has real stakes, even though we all know this is just Part One of a two-part story, is a testament to the skill of the storytellers. In some ways, one might consider Infinity War to be the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Just as \"Empire\" is celebrated for being the dramatic pinnacle of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy - the only film in that trilogy to leave our heroes stranded without a plan, at the end of an Act Two crisis without a third act in sight - Infinity War finds its cast of heroes outwitted and outgunned at every turn, their plans failing, their desperation mounting, hope always dangling just out of sight. The promise of good triumphing over evil is always there, until suddenly it isn't. For a tale with such a sprawling cast and such a multi-threaded narrative, Infinity War does a fantastic job of keeping the story clear, even while moving along at a snappy pace. From the very first scene, the narrative zips along faster than might be expected, as we follow Thanos in his quest to possess all six Infinity Stones, and the various groups of heroes who are scrambling to stop him. Part of the thrill, I think, comes from the fact that the heroes are behind from the get-go, only really grasping Thanos' plan after he's secured a couple of the stones -- and even then, we have various groups of heroes flung out across the galaxy, each group knowing some things that the others don't, and each unaware that the other groups are out there. And so it's a thrill, for instance, when the Guardians of the Galaxy encounter Thor, and are startled to find that they're pursuing a common enemy -- and then must find a way to establish trust with one another so that they can work together. The film has a neat trick of having its setups arrive at payoffs much sooner than you expect. In an early scene, as Iron Man and Bruce Banner are meeting Dr. Strange for the first time, and the three are frantically sharing what they know and trying to come up with a plan to defend Earth, suddenly it proves too late for plans as invading ships land outside. It's a neat way of upping the suspense, having our heroes taken by surprise like this. It upends the usual formula, where the heroes have time to strategize before the \"real action\" begins. It happens many times during this film; it seems the bad-guys are always arriving exactly when you don't expect them to. It's a great hook. This all creates the illusion that this two-and-a-half hour juggernaut is moving along much faster than it actually is. To be honest, I found myself riveted, thinking that I was just watching the opening scenes -- until I checked the time and found that the film was half over. For as weighty as \"Infinity War\" can seem from a distance, given its runtime and its huge cast and its \"tragic\" arc, it's remarkably fun and light on its feet. There are also several elements of the story which transcend the superhero genre, in the way that only the best tales of this sort can muster. The fact that Thanos is a compelling villain who truthfully believes himself to be a misunderstood \"good guy\" captures the insidious way that evil people often operate in the real world. In Thanos, and in the allegiance he inspires in his followers, we can glimpse the kind of world-leader who commits violent acts in the name of a so-called noble cause, and whose rhetoric soothes the ear of many a constituent. Likewise, it's fascinating how each time the heroes lose a battle, it's ultimately not because of physical weakness or secret vice -- it's because Thanos exploits their love for one another. Time and again, the heroes grudgingly fork-over a stone because they think it's better to let Thanos win this particular battle than to let one (or more) of their friends die. And unfortunately, this puts them into the endgame sooner than they expect, at an impossible disadvantage. It is a virute -- love -- that ultimately proves their undoing! This is all great stuff! So tragic! So ironic! So much fun to watch! This is the stuff of real drama, even if we *are* dealing with a comic-book film, and even if it *is* the first part of a saga which we feel pretty sure will turn out all right in the end. ...In fact, maybe it's *because* we know there's a Part Two coming that makes the tragedy of this installment so thoroughly enjoyable. So anyway, I had a really great time watching Infinity War. As many problems as I've often had with the Marvel approach to filmmaking (and even though I still think their films look weirdly flat and ugly, this one included) -- this film really worked for me. I laughed, I cried, I wanted to watch it again. I knew how it would end before I started it, and it STILL reeled me in. So that's a pretty good film, I think.", "Avengers are the best heros .

Well, at least since the 1st Iron Man film came out in 2008. The film begins right after where our most recent Marvel films left off. For the best enjoyment of this film, I strongly recommend you are up to date on your Marvel movies and have seen both Thor:\nRagnorok & Black Panther. It's truly incredible to see every character (well, just about all of them) we've seen so far from the Marvel universe all smashed into one film as they discover a new enemy, Thanos. I was also impressed to see the return of some of the minor characters as well as the big leads. Our heroes this time are somewhat shuffled around and are forced to work with different groupings than normal, which only grew my curiosity as the film progressed. The director has done a great job at \"pairing\" characters to ensure the right tone and comedy is delivered during the film's duration. Without spoilers, some Avengers will make choice or react in a way that felt, well... somewhat out of character. Sure, it could be due to the situation they are in, but I couldn't help but keep feeling like it was slightly out of place. This may have something to do with the script, or perhaps some direction given from the director, not the actors. The action and visual aspects are stunning as the Marvel world and story continues on. Our new villain, \"Thanos\", is heavily focused on and the CGI work on him helps create a deep and fear-inspiring character. Overall, he alone is impressive for a villain. For this film, you will continually feel that the Stakes are high and no Avenger is safe in this movie, in particular when Thanos is present with them on screen. Like all Marvel films, there is always time to laugh and applaud the action scenes, but you will also be shocked at certain outcomes for some characters. Overall, for a film we have all been waiting for so long (only 10 years lol), Avengers Infinity War is the biggest super hero film ever made. The film has done an outstanding job of controlling all the characters but also shaking things up to make the film still fresh and fun. I enjoyed the new villain and was very impressed by some of the CGI work here. You know the rule- stay for the credits... 8.8/10\nWalkden Entertainment", "An event builded for 10 years with no worries of developing deeply most part of it's characters (a merit) an.d sometimes (mainly during wakanda war) lacks balanced tone and for that, becomes some few times a cgi mess. But, even with the advantage of not developing, every character has personality and we fear for their lifes. The action scenes are balanced and well done except wakanda battle and when it embraces tension is awesome and well done. The cgi is good for the most part, thanos cgi is amazing.\nThanos is the best part, the movie is about him, he's the protagonist. It shows his rise in snapping and \"killing\" half of the universe and his emotional fall. Gamora gets a lot more of deep (something that really lacked in GOTG 1 and 2) to.\nA great accomplishment for marvel, russos and for the superheroes story in cinema.", "I as a fan I would give it a 10\nBut as a critic I give it a 9\nIt has the emotional effect after all this years of the MCU\nStory is perfect. The antagonist is perfect.\nFinally we have an end\nBut just the half of it\nCause we have to wait for the second part in 2019", "Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.", "The movie is fantastic loved the Story line and cinematography", "While a tiny bit of the CGI looked odd, the rest of the film was incredibly stunning. The screenplay and overall flow of the story and plot was very good. The handling of over +50 characters blowed my mind. The antagonist, Thanos, is arguably the best villain the mcu has so far. The cinematography and acting was amazing. I enjoyed the humor although sometimes I disliked it. Nonetheless, this was amazing.", "Years ago when the first Avengers movie came out I quit watching half way because I was confused and super bored. Too many characters and too many story lines all at once to invest my time figuring it out when I care 0%. I prefer Samuel L. Jackson with a purple light saber than an eyepatch. Over the years I've caught pieces and snippets of other Marvel movies and they weren't bad! Guardians is fun! Black Panther is cool! Then Netflix got Infinity War. We watched it on Friday night. Whaaaaat? It's so good! Today is Saturday and we just finished watching Infinity War for the 2nd time. Exciting, fun, even if you don't have much of a backstory. Good times all around. Gonna check out what other Marvel movies Netflix has. 10/10", "I got more than I wanted. I expected a good action movie but I got a great and emotionally over welling films", "When all superheroes were combined, and introducing a new villain, I had a little doubt whether this will be successful. But it is an excellent movie. Especially the whole crowd silenced when thanks snapped his fingers and destroyed half of the universe. All the scenes were heroic and the intro scenes were marvelous.

I strongly like the movie because it have many superheroes working together as a team to go against Thanos, even though the heroes failed and Thanos succeed.", "Wow. Marvel Studios threw this beautiful work of art onto the big screen. Its great in every way. They used every character out of every film they made and made them actually have some good parts. Some characters did not have many lines, but it's because they crammed all these characters (in a good way) into a masterpiece movie. The crew at Marvel Studios, thank you. The only thing I did not like about this was killing off half of the characters in the end. I know they ended the film on a cliffhanger, but it was too sad. Why did they choose Nebula to live over Drax or Groot? But most importantly (to me) was killing Spider-Man. Normally, getting me to cry over a movie is tougher than trying to lift 1 ton. I almost was ready to fill my popcorn bucket with tears. Plus, he has been my favorite superhero since I was two. But anyway, Marvel Studios nailed it.", "Amzing movie best of marvel\nOver the past decade marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic book origins.\nThe 18 blocbusters movies produce since iron man first blasted of into the atmosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre.", "Otherwise this movie gonna suck\nThis movie had great scenes But with these great scenes there where also plot holes.Spiderman for me doesnt fit in the avengers he has no experience .", "With a premise so high, for the most ambitious crossover ever. It is really refreshing to see a movie, that can take that premise. and make it big like marvel can.", "Of course, it's a great movie! However, it saddens me because my fave supers were among the half of the universe wiped out: Vision, Stephen, Peter, Wanda. They were such powerful characters in the comics. I wish to see more movies on Dr Strange and Vision and Scarlet Witch! I also hope they will come back in Avengers 4!", "To say this movie was awesome is an understatement. This movie was an emotional roller coaster that I was perfectly fine with dealing with. At this point, I think I've seen this movie about 4 different times. This movie had me dying of laughter one second and then choking on my own tears the next. The action was awesome. The special effects were perfect. The comedy was actually really good. I loved that we got to see more of Peter Parker. Everything really fit like a puzzle.", "Marvel has been building towards this movie since the MCU began in 2008, and this movie meets every expectation for such an ambitious climax. This film doesn't get a 10 from me because I never really felt a particularly awe-inspiring moment such as I did during Captain America: Civil War, although this movie still produces plenty of scenes that make any invested fan experience a range of emotions.", "As someone who mostly enjoys the MCU, Phase Three has been really hit or miss for me. On one hand I loved Black Panther along with this film, but was very disappointed by the dismal Civil War which hardly brought anything new to the table and I absolutely loathed the nonstop comedy and horrible character writing for the main villain in Thor: Ragnarok. You can imagine I was a little cautious about this film, but it managed to exceed my expectations. First and foremost, I would like to thank the directors/writers for finally bringing another great villain to the table. Unlike the majority of Marvel villains who are just evil for the sole purpose of being evil and are mostly carbon copies of Loki (cough, Hela, cough), Thanos is actually a great character who not only has motivations but is a villain who you can root for at times. And at the end, he actually wins. I was also impressed by how the Russos handled the comedy in this film - so much better than the God-awful Ragnarok which was practically destroyed by its own comedy. Here the Russos not only knew how to use humor but they also knew when to tone it down. Most of it came naturally by nature of the situation and wasn't just one-liners thrown in for the sake of one-liners. Thor's arc in this film is exactly how he should have been handled in Ragnarok and his banter between Rocket and Groot was great. His arrival in the Wakanda battle was perfect and they did a great job establishing his motivations for wanting revenge against Thanos. Doctor Strange also had some great action scenes here and he was so much more memorable in Infinity War than in his own movie. From a narrative standpoint, I can understand how this movie would be considered a failure among nonfans/critics because the film doesn't really get enough room to breath when it comes to characters like the \"Secret Avengers\" (Cap, Widow, Falcon, Bucky, etc.), but given how much Civil War made me not care for them and given how bland most of them are (save for Cap who I hope gets more moments to shine in Endgame), I wasn't disappointed by that. Thor and the Guardians had enough time and those characters were part of the main plot points here. The entire Outrider battle in Wakanda was just as chaotic and eyesore-inducing as your average Bayformers film, but thankfully it got much better once Thor arrived. Otherwise the only thing I was a bit disappointed by was that the Black Order were honestly lame villains that might as well have been disposable canon fodder aside from Ebony Maw who had some really cool scenes. Overall just really well done, and unlike Age of Ultron and Civil War which were mostly soulless \"Avengers Junior\" episodes that began the way they ended, this movie actually leaves you feeling like there was a real consequence at the end. While I have concerns for Endgame, I am just happy that I can add Infinity War to my top 5 favorite MCU installments.", "As a big Marvel fan, this satisfied everything I could ever want out of an action movie. Josh Brolin did an incredible job playing Thanos and he became my favorite Marvel villain. I loved that we got to see all of the characters come together to fight Thanos in Marvels most epic battle yet. The jokes are funny, the actions sequences are intense and the characters all have their moments where they shine. The ending will leave you wanting more and very impatient to get it. Not only is it Marvel's best, but probably one of the best movies I've ever seen period.", "One of the best avengers movie from the triology. Don't miss this one", "Amazing movie making experience tying together all all of the various Avenger themed films into one, huge super hero adventure. It was kind of fun remembering which character was with which. The film is long, with some of the expostional dialogue dragging down the spectacular set pieces, but I still enjoyed it and the script has plenty of humour. In my mind Marvel still out weighs DC when it come to character development and story telling", "This film is fantastic, certainty not perfect but it is an enticing humorous film. The twist actually made me want a sequel.", "The latest addition to Marvel's onslaught of cinematic masterpieces really does its job of icing the Marvel cake. The acting and dialogue was superb, the special affects (as always) were amazing, and perhaps the best thing about this movie was its ability to NOT BE predictable. Josh Brolin's performance as the main antagonist Thanos was excellently executed and managed to get me to see things from the villain's point of view (I never do that). The other performances were as well fantastic. There is little to say in the realm of so-so for this movie, other than the fact that Endgame can't come more quickly.", "The dream movie for all Marvel fans. Lots of action, emotions and jokes. Although nkot great. And it does not surpassed Winter Soldier (my favorite MCU movie). Too much changing of scenes that might confuse anyone who haven't watch ALL MCU films. I'm hype of the continuation of infinity War.", "Avengers Infinity War is my number one favorite Marvel comic book movie of the year with loads of fantastic CGI and many superheroes banded together the stuff the maniacal monster Thanos the Mad Titan and his black order. I loved how Infinity War takes place right after Thor Ragnarok as a crossover story in which today's movie Industries crossovers are the new thing and sequels are very obsolete. My only complaint with this movie since I read the original Infinity Gauntlet from 1991 they did not follow the 616 universe because there's no Adam Warlock or magus and especially mistress death in this movie. Also I guess this is more than one complaint Doctor Strange was killed off, Iron Man was Left Alive in the movie while in the original Infinity Gauntlet Tony Stark was killed and Doctor Strange remained alive throughout the six issue Limited series. They were not completely that inaccurate the writers and producers and directors of the movie because Spider-Man did actually died and The Infinity Gauntlet along with black panther, and half of the Guardians of the Galaxy except Drax the Destroyer. Drax the Destroyer has remained alive throughout all the infinity Story lines in the Marvel comic books I have no idea why he was killed off also why was Black Widow kept Alive when she actually died in the Infinity Gauntlet 616 universe. The Russo Brothers did an excellent job on Infinity War except that is not based on the 616 universe.", "Just one thing how can anyone dislike the ending, it was probably the best and most unexpected part of the movie. Thanos snapping his finger and removing half of the universe along with many of our beloved heroes is just unexpected and a bit dark. though yes, many charcters will return in avengers endgame but still this movie stands on its own.\nand finally don't listen to all those 1 or 2 star raters.", "I loved the movie and I think it had a good story line but at some points it was hard to follow and it got a bit confusing because there was so much happening. But overall I loved it and would watch it 10000 times.", "It was highly anticipated and waiting for the second part.", "Avengers Infinity War id the 3rd movie in the series and is surprisingly better than the first two. Although that does not make this a spectacular movie. The fight scenes are great and the actors are top of the notch but this movie does not engage it's audience. Avengers 3 is a movie to watch but does not match the other top movies of the year.", "I was not expecting an ending like the one this movie gave me. It shattered my heart. I loved this movie so much and hated it because it made me sad.", "I enjoyed this movie. There were great acting, action, effects and lines. But putting that many heroes into one movie didn't quite work as well as anticipated. It wasn't much of a story because for most of the film it was just the heroes teaming up against Thanos and his armies.", "Yea, this movie is it. Super engaging plot, hilarious characters, and dramatic beats that feel earned by the end. I love Thanos--he's one of the greatest villains in recent times because he's actually a threat. Cap, Iron Man, Bruce, Spidey, T'Challa, the Guardians, Thor, Vision, Wanda--they're all great and this movie wouldn't be what it is without them. I don't know what to say. I've seen it 3 times at this point and liked it more every time. Marvel has been hitting it out of the park for years and this really is the crown everybody calls it.", "Im not an avid Marvel movie watcher but Ive casually watched them on tv or dvd over the years, but this one topped the lot! Very impressive set pieces and banter between characters. And what an ending!! There seems to be a lot of negative user reviews for some reason but maybe its because you need to have seen most of the previous ones and they dont know what the hells going on! I knocked a couple stars off due to the poor animation of the henchmen of Thanos, particularly the female one, her face looked like a ps3 character! Im getting this on blu for sure :)", "This is a movie 10 years in the making. And it shows", "Avengers Infinity War is the long awaited confrontation of the entire MCU, built up since phase one. Ever since the first Avengers this film has been hyped up; six years of hype. Is it worth it? For the most part yes, in my opinion. I will say this is by far the best Avengers movie. This probably now in my top favorite MCU along with Civil War and Winter Soldier, which the Russo Brothers directed all three. I will say, Civil War is still probably my favorite MCU movie, but Infinity War is close. It's either number two or three. The general plot is simple. Thanos is on a crusade to obtain the infinity stones so he can destroy half the life in the universe. Now it's up to the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him. That's the simplified plot. There's so much this movie does right. First of all is the size of it. This is a huge movie, which it should be since it's based off a huge story arc. This movie felt like a comic book event story come to life, which no other comic book movie has done before. The effects are on point. The action is on point, particularly the big fight in Wakanda. Everyone gives a solid to a great performance, especially Josh Brolin as Thanos. The music was good as well. It perfectly served the film. The film does a great job balancing characters too. Having to balance a cast of this size, from all these other movies, is a daunting task, but the Russo Brothers managed to pull it off for the most part. There were a couple characters I wish had more time, but mostly the characters were all well utilized. Thanos is the easily the best villain in the MCU. Before it was Loki and Zemo, but Thanos blows them out of the water. He is easily the most powerful villain in this universe thus far. The sense of danger is always present with him. This guy has a body count; a high body count. He's not your typical one-dimensional villain either. He's an actual character with some depth, like Loki and Zemo. The ending is also quite ballsy for Marvel. Given that MCU films up until now have been fun and have played things fairly safe, with the possible exception of Civil War, I was surprised they ended like this. I'm equally shocked Disney approved it. If this ending actually sticks going forward; if it's permanent I will commend Disney and Marvel for having balls of steel, but it won't be. We all know this ending will be undone in future movies. However, even Marvel knows they can't just undo the ending and call it a day. What would be the point then? People would say it's a major copout, and would render this film irrelevant. There has to be more. I'm curious to see how Marvel will handle this down the line. I honestly don't know where this is all going, which I guess is a compliment to the film. I do have grievances with the film. In the grand scheme these are minor complaints, but they bug nonetheless. First is the lack of Hawkeye and Ant Man. They do mention both of them, but neither appears in the film, which is a disappointment. I know Ant Man and the Wasp is coming out, but I would still like them to be here since this is supposed to be the movie to united all the heroes from the MCU so far. They were both in Civil War, so they should've been here. The Hulk doesn't appear much either, which was really surprising for me. He has a cool moment at the very beginning, but then never appears again. There are some scenes of him in the final battle, but they're not in the movie. That sucks, because the Hulk is one of my favorites. He did more in Thor Ragnarok. On that subject, this film does make the ending of Ragnarok irrelevant. I don't love Ragnarok, but I do like it, so it was slightly disheartening that Infinity War essentially made that film irrelevant. Also, Thor's power level was kid of all over the place in this film. This guy was able to survive in space with no air and without freezing. I didn't know he could do that. He also took the force of a dying star and lived. The man has some insane plot armor on him in this film. Thor's entire subplot in this film felt a bit pointless. If there was a slightly boring and filler-like bit in this film it would be Thor's quest. It ultimately didn't amount to much. There were a few plot contrivances too; one involving Star Lord and his group. I can't get into that without spoilers. Another is an issue that always comes up in any story when you introduce a villain like this. When you have a villain this powerful, where he's essentially God, there shouldn't be a fight. Thanos should destroy everybody with no struggle and the movie would be over in ten minutes. But they have to nerf him a bit to give the heroes a fighting chance. That's really a nitpick, but it just bugs me a little. Overall, despite my issues, Infinity War is an amazing ride. It's one of my favorite MCU films to date now. My problems are really minor, and mostly my personal grievances. The film was very much worth the hype.", "When I was going into this movie, I was kinda scared that I would be a disapointing movie. I was SOOOOOO WRONG!!!!!!!! The 10 year build-up for this movie was entirely worth it. Every character got a shot on the spot ( well not really the Black Panther characters cause we saw them in their movie). And in this movie, everyone's a badass (especially Thor). And this movie was filmed entirely off of IMAX cameras and that gives a huge advantage to this movie over all the movies because this entire movie is huge. And the action. OMG the action. This is the best action i've seen in a superhero movie and it's so exciting, destructive, and intense. But the main reason why I love this movie so much is because of-none other than-Thanos. He's literally the Darth Vader of Marvel villains. He has so much cinematic depth put in his character that even though he was a evil guy you gave a damn about him throughout the movie. And he had the most screentime out of all the characters in IW. And this movie had lots of emotion put in Thanos' character too. Like when he had to kill Gamora to get the Soul Stone, when he was crying, you wanted to cry with him also. And his motivations to get the Infinty Gauntletmade a lot of sense. They were cruel but they made sense. And this movie leaves you on such a cliffhanger ending that you can't wait for the next Avengers movie to come out which everyone is talking about. And lastly, don't listen to the haters for this movie. They're either drunk, high, DC biased or people that hate superhero movies. Do me a favour, buy it on Blu-Ray in watch it.", "The Story telling, effects, action, way of thinking the decisions...they were all amazing.", "The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.", "This is the best movie ever lololololollololol9llllollllskskskskskskskskskskskskskskksskakakakakaka Shaka k lol I don't know why I'm so sorry to be mean and I'm gonna I was like oh my", "Seeing all these characters interacting with each other on the big screen was such an amazing experience.

Brolin is very scary as Thanos and the rest of the cast is fantastic! Very heartwarming and heartbreaking film", "The only problem with this movie is too many Characters. And since these characters are big in other movies and most people love them,they didn't really have time to enjoy their acts. Because literally everyone was fighting for a space. No wonder sometimes they argue who's plan to use. Thanos defeated them because they didn't have a strategy and no leader.", "You clearly don't understand that the only good movie DC ever released, was wonderwoman. And i'll give it to you, but marvel breaks the ice here. 18 movies now, and all were better than your hugely dissapointing justice league.

And for those 80 year old grandma's who went to see this with their kid... just stop", "I won't say superhero movies are my favorite genre but I watched most of them as I like easy entertainment sometimes and that's exactely what you get with Marvel and DC Comics charachters movies. In Avengers: Infinity War you get what looks like the end of an era. The ending and explanation of alot of questions from other Marvel movies. You won't get bored with this movie as almost all Marvel characters figure in it. Not only the story is entertaining but the CGI's are like always stunning. They clearly spent a high budget on the CGI's and it shows, it's all quality.", "Marvel has started its universe in the uttermost incredible fashion with the start of Iron Man back in 2008 and continued to implement its origin stories and sequels for the next 10 years setting up an iconic film, Avengers Infinity War. This movie turned the tide of what's considered a marvel Villian and produced some staggering scenes that took courage and consistency by Joe and Anthony Russo. This was indeed a Thanos film focused more on his quest for dominance and the infinity stones. It literally felt like 3 films in one bringing over 50 characters together and actually making this work well. I have never seen a director bring so many actors together and create such a memorable masterpiece!", "It was beautiful in some ways and lacked some minor details in other like Ebony Maw was supposed to be extremely powerful and his death could have been improvised.. Also how Thanos's idea to save the world was completely dumb and there was no other idea the writers could think about.

For examples, Thor lost one eye in the previous marvel comic and this one he got it back. So how did he lose his thunder hammer and eye, you had to watch the previous movies.

Could it be some where along the line? one of the heroes went back to the past and change the future... Will wait and see.. Over all, the special effect, story line is okay, not so great. The ending is very disappointing.. like you are seeing the end of Marvel Comic Movie.", "I loved the film but I wait for the second part to comment on the whole.", "The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.", "Excellent Film .. It's enjoyable film.. Everybody hopefully enjoyed it with lot of excitement.. \nIt's another beautiful movie by marvel ..", "After 18 films in the making it has all lead to this. An epic showdown of cinematic proportions on a scale that will never be replicated. The Russo's dons great job at juggling each band of hero's as they try to stop the mad titan. One of the best directed senes was the first big reveal of the black order in New York. The opening is cold and horrifying letting the audience learn how truly powerful Thanos is with just one stone.\nThanos is an awesome villain that is both powerful and sympathetic. He doesn't have a lady death like in the comics. His motivations are set out and make sense as a whole and Josh Brolin's performance is awesome and in my opinion Oscar worthy. \nThe supporting cast as well is nothing to scoff at. They all support the main groups in a good way and each getting time to shine. An outstanding performance comes from Paul Bettney who is amazing in the role and plays off Elizabeth Olsen very well and makes their love more real. He in my opinion turns in an amazing performance that again I feel is Oscar worthy. He shows a wide range of emotion that effects the audience. Chris Pratt has an amazing moment with Zoey Zeldana and his duty to the one he loves. There are so many emotionally charged moments that effect the viewer well after you walk out of the theater. Though the ending is a little down for some unprepared viewers it still doesn't detract from the spectacle and scale the movie is on. The film demonstrates how low our heroes can go and the stakes that were there. Even one of the last lines is depressing yet hopeful. The film is a marvel (no pun intended) of cinematic and storytelling spectacle and how to pull off a great 3rd act of your series.\nThough sometimes slow and characters lacking in substance and reason for being there it still is a great film that is one part emotional and another a war that lives up with its name. Final Score:\n11/10", "Big hip for this movie I'm going to enjoy this movie", "Im truly sad for ending.... But the whole movie is just awesome... Acting, directing , writing, everything is almost perfect. i have to say that marvel doing great job, great plan for these 10 years. Everything connects to previous movies. Directors made it best as possible", "This is going to be a highly downvoted review due to my criticism of the movie, which feeds into what I'm about to get into. First off, the movie was good and was well worth my time and money to see it opening weekend. Marvel has always amazed me with the scale and inter connectivity of the MCU which has never been seen before to any level of this extent, and this movie was certainly one of the most demonstrative one of Marvel's ability to connect together these heroes into one timeline.  However, apart from this demonstration of their ability to connect so many characters, the movie was just a standard super-hero film. It was far from the best movie in the MCU. The soundtrack was okay, far from the level of the works of say Hans Zimmer or James Gunn. The cinematography was decent, but Thor Ragnorok definitely gave Infinity War a run for its money in this department. And the plot itself was expected and anticipated: big villain shows up and throws people around, not much different from the poorer attempts of Sony to make a good super-hero movie. The movie itself made good pacing for its long run time, and I found it hard to find a slower scene in the middle to use the restroom after accidentally ordering something larger than a small drink. It constantly kept me on the edge of my seat and controlled my emotions for the characters.  Overall, watch and enjoy the movie. However, don't go around citing this as the greatest movie of all time as a lot of the die-hard marvel fan-boys have. If you think this is the best movie of all time, go diversify what you have watched and ensure you've seen a lot of the movies on IMDB's top 250 list.", "Wow, Thanos is just sick in this film! AMAZING how they teamed up all of the marvel heroes! Now I am excited for Venom!", "Marvel's innovative way of telling stories has led to the build up of one of the greatest movie cliffhangers and franchise full of heroes known and loved worldwide. Marvel has always been known for its superhero stories ever since the beginning of its first comic which featured the Human Torch in October 1, 1939. Since then, Marvel has continued to strive to develop its characters and bringing its audience on an emotional journey through the death of their favorite heroes or as they conquer their rivals after their arduous journey to become stronger. Marvel's standard of excellence continues to hold true as they released Avengers: Infinity War. This new Avengers movie has split audiences apart some believing that the build up did not match the quality of the ending while others fell head over heels for this emotional action packed conclusion. Avengers: Infinity War success was attributed to its realistic CGI, lovable characters, and concise plot that seamlessly flowed from one scene to the other that left viewers on their feet as they applauded the satisfying conclusion to movie. \nAudiences have a keen eye on the screen as CGI can either carry a movie or ruin it. Throughout the entirety of the film, the hard work and dedication of animators and artists were on full display as Thanos and the rest of Marvel's animated cast fought throughout the universe. The sheer amount of animation is something to marvel at as explosions, characters, landscapes, and powers filled each scene demonstrating the strength on both sides of this heated battle. Marvel also came out with new designs and skills for some of their characters like Iron man and Spiderman with their new suits and their new abilities. Mistakes if any did not affect the first viewing of the movie and after several more screenings I still haven't found any. \nIn addition to Avengers:Infinity War flawless CGI, the movies charismatic characters grabbed the audience. It is hard to ignore the hilarious dialogue between some of the world's most recognizable characters such as Drax, Thor, and Peter Quill. For example in one scene Drax is impressed by the physique of Thor's body as he lays unconscious on a table in Peter Quill's ship and tries to explain to Quill in an argument that Thor is what a real man looks like. The spirit of each character also stayed the same adding to the overall cohesiveness of the movie. \nWhile our favorite characters prepared throughout the universe to fight Thanos the journey to that point was seamless. With a long list of superheroes, the amount of fighting and preparation happening is almost like sensory overload. Luckily, Marvel did an excellent job creating transitions into scenes tying the two parts together using visual transitions and dialogue. As the plot continued to progress, the suspension kept rising like an unstoppable force until it met Thanos the unmovable object. The fact that the conclusion of Avengers:Infinity War had fans sobbing or debating over what will happen in the next movie speaks to the genius behind the plot. The only reason people would speak up is if they are emotionally invested in the movie while if the movie had no effect on them at all they wouldn't feel inclined to say something at all. In the end, I believe this reveals a flowing journey that achieved its goal to captivate its audience and set up for what's to come.\n Many believe that Avengers:Infinity War had poor CGI writing, had poor characters, and had a weak plot with numerous plot holes. Contrary to that belief Avengers Infinity War has shocked the world with its groundbreaking CGI and lovable moments with Rocket acting as a dad and teenager Groot as his eyes are glued to his video game. While there are people who do not like the movie, most shout comments that the movie ended in a meaningless conclusion amongst of sea of other retorts. Who knows what direction this story will take, but the show will go on as it rides the hype created by millions of fans around the world.", "At the very moment of the movie, it was thrilling. This wonderful movie was not only the best of Marvel's movie, but also the most entertaining and exciting movie I've ever seen.", "This movie is entertaining. It has good acting, good action and a great ending.  But it's not a masterpiece like everyone says. Its not the best superhero movie and its not even the best MCU movie in my opinion. It's just a fun movie. That's it.  I would recommend this movie to Marvel fans or someone with some free time.", "I am flabbergasted by all the incredibly negative reviews of this movie. Is it the best movie ever made? Of course not. Is it, as some puerile reviewers imply, the worst movie ever made? Nope, it ain't that either. Somewhere in the depths of reviewer land there exists a rating that is much more reasonable, say an 8 or so. So that's the rating I'll give it. I enjoyed this movie. It kept me entertained, and, excuse me, but that's all most movies should aspire to.", "Even if you've only seen a few of the other Avengers movies you won't be disappointed.", "It's goning to blow you and break your heart and make you watch it for 20 more times. Every thing in the movie is perfect, from costumes to direction.", "If you want a movie that makes you rethink everything that has happened in Marvel, Infinity War is the movie to watch. Marvel's \"Infinity War\" was one of the best movies I've seen. Almost every fan favorite hero from Marvel made an appearance in the movie. With every minute, there was a different scene that made it more exciting. From the emotions triggered to the plot, some people were not happy with the outcome. Sprouting many controversies, some people were mad to the point that they never wanted to watch a Marvel movie again. Though, these reviews on the different parts of the movie seem to have negative effects, the majority loved it. Although \"Infinity War\" is a controversy, it is a well written movie that targeted viewer's emotions and intrigued many through the portrayal of the plot.\n At first, I was not really into Marvel. It was not that I disliked the comics or refused to watch the movies, I had never been into them and knew very little about the heroes in them. I had heard about it from my father and my brother because of their countless banters about which hero is the best. Though I was opposed to the idea, my family went together to see the latest movie, Infinity War. I knew most of the characters from the movie such as Captain America, Dr. Strange, Spider Man and Iron Man. A couple of the characters I did not really know, so, I kept nagging my brother about who was who. By the end of the movie, I was engrossed by the entrancing plot. Of course, my brother and my dad were talking about it after, and this time, I could chime in too. Infinity War is one of the last comics in the series. All of the past heroes join together to beat evil and everything turns out well. Wrong. In this movie, most of the fan favorite heroes \"die\", or so we think they did. This movie started to cause controversies about what the ending should have been, and what it is now. Each character was written into the story for a purpose, which they either fulfilled or didn't. Thanos, the main villain of the plot becomes the single most powerful person in the entire universe, eliminating half of the existing population. Because of this, people were confused, hurt and even offended by the outcome of this movie. Patiently waiting for part two of Infinity War, fans are still questioning and debating the ending of the film. There are comics in print of the movie that it is based off of, but it somehow strays so now the movie and the comics are different. Though they are different, the movie still shows everyone's favorite characters. It even includes some that have not even been released yet, such as Captain Marvel. Infinity War is an exciting movie that should be watched. It should be watched and is one of the better movies I have seen in a while. With each scene, there is a new mood and tone to the story. The ending is a huge plot twist for many, but still gives people something to talk about. I, among other fans patiently wait for the sequel of this movie, and cannot wait to be surprised.\n Infinity War started off as a slow movie that was a little bit confusing. As the plot carried forward, there was more of an intriguing feel. After over half of the movie was finished, the audience was captured by the story. With a lot of action, every second left the audience questioning what possibly could happen next. By the end of the movie, people were captivated and amazed. The only thing that caused controversy was how it ended. It left many people questioning what would happen next and if the heroes would actually save the day. After countless debates of wether the movie should have ended like that, there was still confusion and assumptions about the ending. Personally, I thought that it was amazing. Thanos, the main evil character changed the life of Marvel characters forever. Without him, there would be no plot at all. At the end, some of the favorite characters from Marvel disappeared. This targeted the viewer's emotions which some were not in favor of. This was an attack of emotions to the audience. They were furious that their favorite character died and wanted answers right away.\n I think that this movie should be watched because of all the aspects that make it a truly, great story. Though some parts are disliked by viewers, the movie is still jam packed with action that gets you at the edge of your seat. With each line scene comes a different feel to the movie which makes it a butt-clenching ride the whole way. I would highly recommend this movie to people who don't know much about Marvel, because maybe, just like me, they will start to love it too.", "Most films that are hyped are ussually heartbreakingly underwhelming- but for once the MCU didn't disappoint. From the heartbreaking ends -( some unexpected and some foreshadowed ) to the stunning visuals , Infinity War pleases all audiences and genres moving away from the fantasy sci-fi to a drama action that has its emotional highs and lows.", "I was in the movie Theater like a kid at 1cent candy store lol loved it", "I was left speechless, shocked, surprised and i was really looking forward to the next part.\nIt's a complete movie as well as a part of a whole at the same time.\nMust watch, but make sure you've watch previous movies to fully enjoy it.", "Now based on the title card. I'm not saying this is the best movie I've ever seen nor am I saying that this is my favorite movie. However, from beginning to end I was hooked and impressively entertained with all of the scenes in this movie. Avengers: Infinity War will have you laughing, crying, and filled with rage. Combining all of these elements into a very emotional film. All of the payment from the last 10 years of Marvel movies is definitely worth it in this movie. The performances are great, each character serves a purpose to the story, and it probably has some of the funniest lines out of any Marvel movie apart from Thor: Ragnarok. The plot doesn't have a lot of depth and seems very simple. But if you've seen all the previous movies leading up to this one you won't even care. Please do not watch this movie if you are being introduced for the first time to the MCU. You will be confused and not care about the characters. Go watch all the MCU movies before seeing this one. This movie was one heck of an experience and I know I will be seeing plenty more of it in the future! WAKANDA FOREVER!!!", "Marvel made a full blown event the fans connected the characters what we saw in harry potter but less marvel completed his 10 year heritage this without all its characters its due to copyright the authors did a great job this superhero character is in an incredible frame but Mr Kevin Feige did this movie is full of emotional and lasting moments and especially action unexplained Thanos he is visually awesome and has a veritable goal in short unrivaled", "This was without a doubt the best superhero movie I have ever seen and possibly the best movie period. I have grew up alongside the MCU I seen iron man when I was 6 and have followed both the comics and movies ever since. I was sceptical, 21 movies I have loved all coming to a climatic end, I wasn't sure marvel could pull it off, but they did....\nThe action scenes alone where on a massive scale and outstanding to watch unfold, the character building of thanos was emotional and he kept me at the edge of my feet every time he appeared on screen next to a hero.\nThis movie will forever be remembered and rightly so", "If I could give this film an 11 rating I would! Since Iron Man 1 I've been hooked on the MCU and eager to see where it was all leading. And 10 years later this certainly doesn't disappoint. From the opening scene to the last I was gripped. Josh Brolin portrays the Mad Titan Thanos brilliantly. And now I can't wait to see how the remaining Avengers come back from \"the snap\".", "New and fresh, extremely ambitious and yet still familiar, the final act is absolutly insane! And you will remain on edge for hours after the credits roll, Here The Russo brothers have managed to blend the typical Marvel movie with an Oscar worthy experience of a lifetime", "This movie is beyond imagination,best movie ever,cant wait for new avengers", "Infinity War is a wildly ambitious and entertaining ride. For the first 90 minutes it pulls it off. However i was bored in the last 60 minutes. It's very funny, and many of the characters are on good form. Thanos is an intimidating villain, cunning and cruel. But like so often with Marvel he does come up short. And blink and you'll miss Black Panther, bar the fantastic Wakanda battle,  Everyone floats away at the end, and it will do likewise in my memory.", "The only comic book movie that can rival The Dark Knight", "Have u moved over it yet bc i sure haven't and it's on my nightmares like tHE AUDACITY WHY WOULD U DO THIS TO ME HHHHHH", "It's a little bit boring from the first time movie start.

Besy villain in the MCU. Generally upsetting in places. Laugh out loud moments. Amazing effects.", "Really a great film to watch. A lot of action and twists in only two and half hour long movie. A new anti-hero, whose character has been crafted for over six years in previous movies and post credit scenes, is at the rise and his powers are becoming unstoppable. The cards between heroes and anti-heroes are dealt very well and a great balance between them are established. You can be excited for a lot of traumatic deaths in this film. But who knows if there be a resurrection. The ending is just hilarious and unpredictable. The DC Universe seams like a rubbish in compare with the Marvel Universe. I hope that the next movie will be at least as good as this one. Though, If you miss some Marvel movies in the past, you may have some problems with the understanding of the plot of this great movie. However as a Marvel fan it is a super movie that honourably ends a third phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I am really excited for the next part.", "The BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE SINCE THE DARK KNIGHT!!!!", "About Infinity War No, I'm not giving you any spoilers in this post I honor the moral code. \u2764 First of all, \"Avengers Infinity War\" is a misleading title. Even though there were Avengers in it, it's still a Titan film; Thanos's film. The antagonist with gentleman qualities who shall not disappoint you. Much like fans, like us, like me, Thanos too was waiting for this moment, which in his own words, \"Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.\" AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. The war was worth waiting for.\nOut of Avengers, Thor was the centre of attraction and my personal favourite in the film. (Jabse ye Ragnarok se aaya hai bada comedy ho gya hai.) Thor gave super-humor positive vibes though the tense moments. Truly a God. Other than him, Iron Man's new armour with nano-tech was too much animated but nevertheless quite mind-blowing. \u2764 \nThe film mainly focus on emotional element and to be frank it's definitely heartbreaking. Russo brother's blend of humor, action, emotion, in their storytelling was beyond my imagination. It was 'so-damn-perfect.' They earned it.  PS: There's an end credit. Only for those who wait. \"Valar Morghulis.\" -Thanos", "I watched Avengers Infinity War last night. This movie was 10 years in the making so I was very hyped to watch it. Fortunately it lived up to my expectations. To start the movie is pure eye candy. All around the movie had amazing CGI. There was something happening every few minutes that was near breathtaking. It really captured the magic of the comic books. The movie was also completely epic in scale. Everything was bigger for this movie. The fights were intense and in your face and really showcased everyone's super powers. I also thought the movie did a good job with character interaction. Everyone's favorite superheroes all had their moments to shine. It was also great to see all the superheroes interact with each other. I really liked Thanos as a villain also. I think he really lived up to the hype as a good villain. I'm really looking forward to the next movie to see how his character evolves. Story-wise the movie wasn't bad, but let's not kid ourselves this movie was an excuse to see all the superheroes together. The movie did exactly what it said it was going to do. Provide a fun and intense superhero Blockbuster. The movie does have a very steep learning curve though. It requires you to have seen all of the other comic book movies to really understand the scale of what's going on.  This is also one of the few Marvel comic book movies that isn't quite kid friendly. The movie is pretty dark and lacks the humor most of the new movies have. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is easily the most epic comic book movie ever made. A 8.5 out of 10.", "First of all, those having difficulty in understanding the movie have not watched all the 18 movies prior to IW. Everything in this movie is outstanding, and what most people ignore while rating is the fact that the story is yet to be completed.\nThe movie, as a whole, is written very nicely. Some details have been purposely kept out as they will be highlighted in the next Avengers movie, due to arrive on 2019. The character development is fine, as the makers have not shied about revealing the humane side of the superheroes. Thanos is the big baddy, and he dhows the megalomania we all love in a classic villain.\nOnce again, watch the movie and judge yourself regarding the hard work of the whole cast and crew.", "Spoiler Free review of Avengers: Infinity War. A chef, famed for his art is threatened to make something he has never attempted before. With a gun to his head and the life of his family on the line, he kneads the dough in tears. What he creates is filled with heart and sorrow and is the best there will ever be. The chef and his family survive and should be celebrated for what they have achieved. Avengers: Infinity War is such a creation.  Thanos for me has become the most complex and the most passionately developed character since Dark Knight's Joker. Josh Brolin killed it, even though he was mostly CGI'd, his voice alone was an alarm for danger. Even with most of his backstory that would explain his motive is left out, you will still understand him. Some part of you will accept what he wants to achieve and you will respect him. He personifies the failure that you do not need but its inevitability makes you want to like his existence. Every single character in this movie was devotedly given a purpose. Some succeed, some fail, but their efforts will give you goosebumps throughout the movie. Thor makes an entrance that was so cool that it almost made me tear-up with joy. The kid in my heart was alive and elated. Marvel has created a formula that they so intricately yet mildly tweak every time that they end up creating something so diverse, it stands out on its own. However, Infinity War is a whole new ball game. It is unlike any other Marvel movie because it does what I like about DC and why I am a DC fan. It is DARK! It is dark, it is grim and it will fill your heart with anguish until it gives you the closure that you so desperately need at the end of the story. I read comics and I have read infinity war in 2013 when it was released. I am glad that they are taking the Marvel Cinematic universe on a completely different tangent. This is nothing like the \"Infinity\" story arc and it is equally massive and entertaining. The chemistry of all the characters is Marvelous (hehe). Seeing all powers work in unison is a sight to behold. Their resolve unbreakable, their masterful maneuvering seems beyond compare, only to be met by a God that keeps on consuming power. The unstoppable force met the immovable object here and the collision was as big as the universe and devastating yet beautiful. I do not think it was possible to make the movie any better than it is. Infinity War is different and I loved it. The hardcore fan, the kid, the comic book geek, the movie buff will all drop their jaws in awe and will enjoy this to their heart's content. It's going to get \"massiver!?\". The post-credit scene confirms that there will be Captain Marvel to intervene in part 2 of this Universal War. Captain Marvel is going to be played by Brie Larson (Oscar-winning actress for Room). Ms Marvel is confirmed by the writer to be the most powerful member of the Avengers so far. Can't wait! 10/10 will chew on my fingers along with the popcorn again. I bought popcorn. In a theater. POPCORN! That's how good the movie is.", "I expected to be disappointed, but this movie delivers on all fronts. Thanos is genuinely a revelation and thankfully not only feels completely real in the CGI sense but also capture every last detail of Brolin's performance. I was completely engrossed for the entire movie. The Russo's wield their own Infinity Gauntlet over the Marvel Universe with absolute control. My only reservation is whether the consequences will stick in the next part; I hope they remain brave and leave some in place. Superb!", "This the same marvel flick we always enjoy , yet personally it's the best one yet because of the suprises it packs. This is most possibly the most darkest film in the Marvel Universe yet. It marks the start of the new era of marvel cinema , and possibly every Marvel movie you will see from now will be much darker and wilder. There is everything in thid movie :Drama , Aomedy , Action , SciFi , Thriller , Adventure , Romance , an ending that will twist your mind. \nIf you've heard that the ending is bad , that's because it slightly is , but the next avenger will only give true Justice to this ending. 8/10 if you've never seen any Marvel movie before", "OK great to entire marvel heroes beat Thanos; missing part we need Agent of Shield, Iron FIst Defender and Captain Marvel and Fantastic Four.

Visually it is superb with excellent special effects and settings throughout, and there is the right amount of humour spread across the characters. The plot transitions from the different group of heroes well, and manages to balance the story with the action - the slower, emotional scenes often have the same impact as the large scale and explosive actions scenes. However, the same criticisms of the Marvel series of movies are still there - the heroes are thrown about seemingly to no consequence, the plot just trundles along at times with little respite, and some of the fight scenes are so quick so you can't see the action.", "Iam RAJESH KUMAR.C From INDIA. \n43/582.PRAKASH NAGAR KADAPA- 516001\nANDHRA PRADESH INDIA \nC.RAJESH KUMAR", "Thanos, the villain, is the real main character of this movie.

This film has everything and then some more from the kitchen sink. I was half-way expecting a cavalcade of Disney characters to come romping through this movie. Where were the Transformers? Where were the Jaegers from Pacific Rim? I feel cheated!!  I had cinematic issues with some very derivative visuals / plot issues: The initial villian assisting Thanos looks an awful lot like Lord V from Harry Potter. The nasty animals trying to overrun Wakanda towards the end were directly borrowed from Lord of the Rings (the CGI looked identical, too). In the scene where the Avengers seem so close to overpowering Thanos, it was wildly over-telegraphed that Starlord was going to ruin it...and that cliched scene has been repeated over and over elsewhere. Yawn.  But can we talk about the overarching plot here? So, why is Thanos a Malthusian? What's the evidence for an overpopulated Universe anyway? What's Thanos' beef? Consider: At least with Hitler and the Germans, they had a legitimate grievance (no matter how incredibly exaggerated into unconscionable and despicable action) regarding their treatment after WWI. We hear Thanos pontificating at various points to justify his quest to indiscriminately wipe out half the Universe...geez...that makes a lot of sense. It makes NO sense and he espouses no coherent viewpoint or justification, no matter how ill conceived, to back up his request. Well, is that any different than any insane villain? Perhaps not...but I thought the stones would at least give him some smarts...clearly not.  So, I'm giving Infinity War eight stars based on the rapturous FX and outrageous character mashups but still find the plot unnecessarily weak on the essentials. BTW, I have no beef with the sad ending: It's about time reality struck. The Earth is on course to an overheated oblivion, too...we better get used to unhappy endings.", "I was on movie theatre to see my favorite heroes (infinity war) , I realised that they are not only my heroes but they are heroes of world .", "The amazingly satisfying payoff to a 10 year super saga.", "Marvel studio outdoes itself once again in the Avengers series. How is it that a film of this nature could be so grandiose and powerful? Can be so heroic yet funny at the same time? The malleability of the team is simply incredible and you just feel the culmination of years of hard work paying off in this masterpiece. The antagonist's ambition and motive may be simple, but it feels realistic and most important asks questions about humanity and mankind, making him one of the best villain the series has showcased. The film is also a treat to the eye, and perhaps the best showcase of modern cinema. The only negative is perhaps the lack of closure, the feeling of yearning for more. There is no doubt that the film is a cash cow for Disney, but if anything it is a gorgeous golden cow, just keep milking it please.", "The best thing about my watching this movie at home was the BluRay (from my public library) presentation, super video and audio. In the last Avengers movie the focus was on Ultron. Here the focus is on Thanos, played very well by Josh Brolin in motion capture to create a menacing character. What is lacking, for me, is a good story that unfolds nicely. As some reviewers have said, just putting large numbers of characters in a story doesn't necessarily make it a better movie. The story is pretty simple, Thanos wants to get all the infinity crystals, that will give him the power to destroy half of the universe, as a way of saving it from too large a population. But it often isn't easy to follow and understand the meaning of all the story elements that lead up to the final scenes.  For action junkies this movie has lots of it. Almost nonstop action, fighting scenes, big battles, in fact often too much so that the mind becomes numb to additional gore. Now I see there is a \"an untitled\" Avengers movie in preparation for 2019. The franchise marches on.", "When the trailer is out.. i'm very exciting!

I hope marvel can make film like this again", "It's ro dark with a perfect cast it's to amazing \ud83d\ude0d", "Love Thanos... I feel sorry for Thanos instead of Avengers", "I read part of The Infinity Gauntlet (the comic book story that this is loosely based on) and admittedly, I was a little apprehensive about this movie. Not saying the comic book was bad, it was actually pretty good, but a bit much for it's own plot. That aside though, to be fair, I've always hated crossovers for a long time, and Avengers was no exception (I haven't watched the other two movies). But when I saw this movie, it gave me a newfound respect and love for marvel movies. It's probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen (aside from The Dark Knight). I'm still not really a Marvel fanatic, but this movie changed me from being a Marvel hater. I liked a lot of stuff about this movie, it wasn't so fast paced that you wouldn't know what's going on, no so slow paced that you get bored. I really liked how it could have awesome action and yet still take time to build up it's characters and story. Speaking of the story, I usually like my stories dark, and I liked how this one departed from the typical \"funny\" marvel feel for a darker and more intense tone, it made the movie more relatable than other superhero movies I've seen (with, again, the exception of The Dark Knight trilogy). Also, when I say it's better than it's own source material, I mean the source material might've set the foundations for it, but it doesn't come close to it's greatness. Thanos this time is a villain who's compelling, dark, and even somewhat relatable, everything all the good villains should be, the heroes in this movie were great too, but Thanos really made it for me. The production values were also, as you should expect from a Marvel movie by now, off the charts. The visuals all looked so real that I was surprised when my 3d animation teacher showed some behind the scenes footage of it being a greenscreen, I honestly could not tell the difference between a set piece and a green screen with this movie, it was that good. That also give the actors credit, because not only are a lot of them some of my favorite actors (Benedict Cumberbatch being my most favorite out of the bunch), but also that they could act so well in front of a green screen and characters who would be animated in later. I used to have this spite for the vast amount of special effects marvel has (which I sometimes deemed unnecessary), but once again, that all changed with this movie. There are a few flaws with this movie though. For one, though Thanos made up for this, I found a lot of the side villains to be forgettable, cliche, or underdeveloped, they felt more disposable than pretty much any other one-movie marvel villain. They still lead to some pretty epic fights, I'll give them that, but as characters they were kind of so-so. Also (and I don't mean to put any spoilers in here), Thanos, while being a memorable villain, seemed to be a bit too overpowered for my taste. Sure, tough villains are kind of my thing, but he kind of pushes that envelope. For the most part, he seems to succeed mainly not just from his infinity gauntlet (I'll give him credit for actually using his power, overpowered though it may be), but from some of those cliche \"guy gives up something vital to save someone else\" tropes than from his own power. That being said, it's still a fantastically made superhero movie nonetheless, it deserves a top spot on anyone's list. Definitely give Avengers: Infinity War a try, even if you're not a superhero, action, avengers or whatnot fan.", "This is one of my favorite Marvel Movie, I love the cast, acting, humor, emotionally. I can't wait to see what would happen in Avengers 4", "One the the most amazing movie ever \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0d Best marvel movie , really loved the story especially Thanos story and how the Avengers reunion again.", "The movie is a must watch.

The film is written in a way that has 1 huge advantage and 1 huge downside. The action packed, character packed movie offers a great experience, especially in a IMAX movie theater, time flies by and lots of awesome moments occur. \nThe scale of the movie also means that some of the favorite characters get undercut heavily tho.  8/10 because they delivered on one of the biggest productions ever", "Amazing movie with constant action! Probably one of the best marvel movies ever and it was good that they had so many different characters in it!", "Always love Russo brothers' films and Avengers series. now they both combine to one so makes me expectable! the box office proved I and Marvel supervisors were correct.

Although this movie is rated about an 8.7 on IMDB, many user reviews claim that it is overhyped and confusing and they are simply wrong. This movie is everything it promises and much more. It has great emotions, plot, and above all a great villan. This is the best avengers to date and in simple terms, a must see film.", "As a big marvel fan, i can say that this is the best marvel movie so far in the MCU!  Now there will be those that disagree but we all know MCU has been building up to this for some time now, and it did not disappoint, with the witty comedy and typical superhero moments... I would heavily recommend this movie and franchise to anyone wanting to start a new mcu journey, or for those to rewatch as I can guarnatee you missed something!", "The storyline begins it's end run with Thanos (Brolin) on his mission to collect ALL the infinity stones. The film jumps around quite often but engages the audience with the Avengers spread out and fighting separate battles. The question WHAT does Thanos really want. The answer is not trivial as we see in his dialogue and speeches, world domination and to kill half the population with the snap of his fingers. The fight sequences as usual are tremendously done and the CGI is completely amazing. There are some funny quips along the way, inside plots and story's we see expanding. I truly liked the film BUT I was not prepared for the loss of heroes we had to suffer. I look forward to the next installment to see what happens. I give this a 9 out of 10.", "This is best movie i ever seen... I can't find words to say about it", "I absolutely love this movie, it's something I have been craving to see ever since I was a little kid.

I can't add much to the other positive reviews on here except to say, if you haven't seen it then you won't be disappointed. It's brilliant.", "That a movie like this is possible these days is a real feat in and of itself. Years of films and series content have built a rich cinematic universe spanning multiple independent threads and subplots, each with its own style and feel and tone, and full of rich characters both big and small. The character development alone makes this capstone film a culmination not just of a closely knit and well-maintained continuity, but evolution and deepening of the heros playing their parts. I would have thought something like this would be doomed to failure, being too big, too ambitious, too broad in scope and grand in vision to work. But, they did it.  Somehow it doesn't disapoint. The same actors reprising the same roles, all this time later, and those roles have not only blossomed in their own rights, but the dynamics between them as well. And now we are treated to new dynamics and chemistries. Seeing the likes of Star Lord on the same screen as Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark was a particular treat, as was seeing the special kind of comedy that Thor and Drax both add to the screen, side by side. There was a lot of opportunity here for personality clashes and disharmony, but for the most part that doesn't happen.  There's also plenty of spectacle, given the huge amount of special effects and epic visuals, but the most adrenaline-prompting aspect of the film is the mere prospect of the contest we're finally witnessing. Seeing vastly powerful characters built up over all this time finally coming face-to-face with a villain who not only carries the sheer might, but the screen presence to truly match and best them. It's dark, but not as dark as the Dark Knight, nor anywhere near as cynical or gritty as Watchmen. It blends action, comedy, and all those carefully built inside jokes, relationships, and character quirks with a sweeping plot based on perhaps the best comic storyline of all time. It manages to be easy watching, but epic and deep, simultaneously. The Thanos we get on screen is the ultimate nihilist, and yet his character brings as much stark humanity as it does merciless destruction.  And the punches don't get pulled. We see beloved characters fall, break, and fail, and it's breathtaking because these are characters that if you've plowed your way through the MCU films have so much history and past behind them, and into which we've invested so much of our attention and consideration, if not affection.", "As a fan of this franchise, I'm still in shock from this movie.\nThe super heros, vilians, and all the strange creatures have finally meet their faith, in the form of the toughest sob to ever appear in any of the related movies.\nIt doesn't matter who you adore, Thor, Captian America, Hulk, Black Panther, Spider Man, or even Groot - they are all here. And it's not easy.\nWhat I loved in this movie is the amount of shocking scenes, and the twists. Excellent plot, script, directing, animation & effects.\nThis movie is a must watch.", "I loved the first two Avengers, I thought they were amazing. I feel like this one suffered inspiration. The jokes were more irritating than funny, there were too many Super Heroes at different locations and the dialogues were poor.\nThe only people I was into, were Thanos (amazing) and Gamora. It's difficult to be invested in that movie because right from the beginning, you're already in the middle of some actions, and it never stops, feeling like you may have missed something.\nThere isn't a real plot, more of a philosophical approach that sustains the film, but a pretty good one.\nThanos was frankly genuinely amazing. The dialogues between him and Gamora were the more interesting. The battles seemed too inconsistent, too many effects, too little story. The ending on the other hand was fantastic. It saved the film. I was expecting the usual ending (good thing Thor didn't go for the head lol), and was very surprised. \nHope to see more of Gamora and Thanos on the next episode.", "One of the most intense movies I've ever seen. I was thoroughly engrossed with this movie and for me that is a rare thing.", "I really enjoyed the movie with all its great twist and turns of all the different teams of other movies coming together and really showing the excellent writers did to make it entertaining.

Since DC/Warner is still not understanding how to do it i am looking forward to the next 10 years on how Marvel is developing and interpreting the comics. @MCU Directors/Producers: I believe I always knew where it should go and there is still more potential for raising the \"level\": What really must/should happen is including the x-men universe especially with LEGION. I have heared there are plans telling the stories of the celestials, galactus, eternity... and Sony seems to plan something big too (Life, Venom, ?(Mysterio aka Gyllenhaal) etc. which is long overdue, but the most important element that was missing until Avengers (and Batman Dark Knight) was drama. Legion is fortunately taken care of by Hawley (as a series) which is something really special, but the potential movies would have with Legion is indescribable.\nAnd one last thing.. the music defines 50% of the movies. Please get inspiration from Tarantino movies, Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy.", "Let's get started. I'm not going to compare Infinity War to any other film. This is just a review of Infinity War itself.  In Avengers Infinity War, the Avengers unite to protect the powerful Infinity Stones from the mass murderer Thanos who seeks to destroy half the life in the universe to restore \"ultimate balance\" to the universe so suffering may cease.  That seems like a good idea, and it's actually a fairly classic superhero plot. The problem is is that it's exaggerated to a point where you have to believe in fantasies of a whole new degree. I mean come on, how old is the idea of half the life in the universe disappearing? To me it's way too kiddish and cheesy.  But let's get started on what I like about Infinity War. Infinity War takes the idea of uniting the Avengers beautifully and it leads up to a nice and ballsy ending. The CGI of Infinity War is quite spectacular and everything does look alien as it should. The native looks native and the alien looks alien. The battles are thrilling and the cinematography and special effects are off the roof. The acting is brilliant as well.  Then why am I rating this movie a 7/10? Because it makes a good film to watch with friends and family. Not a film you'd want to watch on your own and that makes you feel more completed as a person.  Infinity War felt like one of those action films you can watch as a high school or college student and enjoy thoroughly. I watched it recently with my friends and generally superhero movies were supposed to be like that. An enjoyable family friend experience. But nowadays, the meaning of superhero movies has changed into something different. Superhero movies aren't just about blockbuster action and thrilling special effects nowadays.  Infinity War took the classic route to Superhero blockbuster action and I can say. We've had too much of it lately. It's not a movie I'd probably even thinking about watching alone at home or late at night in my room because it doesn't make you feel any different anyway beginning to end. Too many plotholes exist and lilttle character development take place. And PLOT and CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT are key to a spectacular movie.  But I won't deny that I enjoyed it. I certainly did enjoy Infinity War, but I felt that it lacked in too many places. I'm saying this as a true movie head as I love films which touch the heart and have thrilling action. But Infinity War only has thrilling action. Nothing much else really. An incredibly thrilling movie to watch, but not a spectacular movie in any other aspect. It's a good movie to watch for the adrenaline and nothing else really. Comparing this to other cinemas, I'd have probably rated this movie a 6.8/10. This movie is a blockbuster movie and it wont retain it's place in time. That's my review.", "Like most people, I was really looking forward to this movie, as the first Avengers movie from 2012 has great meaning to me, as I believe it was the first PG-13 movie I ever saw in the theater, and my dad wanted to see it and I was unaware of it. Ever since then, I have seen every MCU movie in the theater with exceptions of \"Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2\", \"Doctor Strange\", and Ant-Man. I saw this in 3D opening weekend. We got there an hour early and by the time the movie started, the area behind us in the theater was almost completely filled up. This was one of those big movies that are a special occasion. 2 examples are \"Marvel's Avengers\" (2012) and \"Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens\". This will be another short review, but this movie gave us the Iron Spider suit, one of my favorite Spider-Man suits, and gave us Thanos, something they've been hyping up since 2012 as a post credit scene to \"Avengers\". This is my second favorite MCU movie, and the first is \"Avengers\". I could probably see myself watching this once or twice a year. This was so good, but I didn't feel for any of the characters that \"died\", as I knew they were coming back. But overall, this is a great MCU movie and definitely worth a watch.", "Enjoyed it, but too many comedic lines which made it rather corny. I loved the depth of Thanos character, but hopefully this is just a set up for the second part to be better. Hopefully less of the corny lines. This was borderline C3PO in the Star Wars prequels, overkill comedy.", "Everything  \nIt has everything  Just watch it \nJust do it \nThe only self gain in this world to cure your crushing anxiety is this movie \nSo overall  \nIt's F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S", "Althoug i dont like fantastic movies, i like this movie. It's impressed to me.", "One of the best movie or super heroes movie of the year. \nIt content so much unsatisfied feeling because it have not released many seens.", "I love this movie and you will too. Everything about it is fantastic.", "I NEVER LOVED A MARVEL MOVIE LIKE THIS.\nI was surprised that every character did his role in an amazing way, it's not just storyline now.\nHope next part is as good as this, or better :D", "Best marvel film made to date, my favourite comic film bar the dark knight. This film has everything! I was blown away.", "Infinity War is by far one of the best, if not THE best MCU movie so far.  The writers weren't afraid to take risks by killing off half the cast as well as a hand full of heroes before. They also made Thanos into the best villian in the MCU by showing the emotional side of him and how he feels he's doing the right thing. It was a nice change from the generic bad guy who wants to destroy the wold just to destroy it. I also like the ending. It was original. In most summer blockbusters, the good guys defeat the bad guys, but in Infinity War, it was the other way around.  I liked how it was different in general. My heart skipped a few beats when I watched the opening scene. I knew it had to be different, but I didn't know how different. After that scene, a sense of dread stayed with me for the entirety of the movie.  There are a lot of criticisms of the characters turning to ash at the end when some have solo adventures later on, but this stays true to the comics. Characters die all the time in the comics and are revived one way or another.  Many of the criticisms are about it not exceeding expectations but the fact is, it won't If you've imagined it a certain way. I did this as well but my ideas were crap and I'm glad it turned out the way it did. Overral, Avengers: Infinity War was a stellar movie and I can't wait for Avengers 4.", "If you look beside that Wanda, Vision, Sam, Black Panther, Quill, Spider-Man and many more either dies or vanish.... then this IS, by far, the best Avengers movie of them all - no doubt about that. A lot of action, the usual funny comments from Thor and and many emotional scenes.\nIf you haven't seen it, do yourself a favour nd do it....", "It's surprising how thor the God of thunder sparked the neutron star again and made it to glow I mean how it is possible. A star is died and sparked again I think that's a great thing to do.\nJust like little Groot holds the stormbreaker of THOR which is actually is a kings weapon.\nWell as we know it , in MCU everything is possible. Loved the movie, and excited to watch upcoming avengers.", "The is one of the best movies in the MCU line up, based purely on a storytelling and action. The villain(s) are great and the visuals are astounding. However on a personal level I lost a lot of enjoyment based solely on who was more of a main character than who. A lot of the characters I find annoying or boring had more time to do things in this movie than those I enjoy. Also Ebony Maw was dispatched too quickly. Movie loses its appeal the more time passes. Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 6/10\nMovie Score (LetterBoxd): 7/10", "Alright so obviously this culmination event film is full of awesome action, hillarious comedy, and some heavy feels :'( and it would be crazy to say it isn't a good movie or even potentially a great movie. That being said there are problems one of which id like to focus on. The power scaling is so crazy throughout the whole movie, when Thanos fights hulk 1v1 with only the power stone(it does give it's bearer increased strength and durability) and bests him easily I was shocked. Later in the movie Drax and Spider-Man holding Thanos is enough to subdue him albeit with some help from the others too but physically paralleled strength seems weird compared to Hulk and Thor. Another example of this is the scene when Iron Man is fighting him primarily on his own on Titan and he cuts his face while also being able to go toe to toe while he had the power, space, reality and soul stone. I suppose we don't know the biology of the alien members of the guardians and clearly Star-Lord retains his half celestial lineage aka his physical durability is better than a regular human but it seems crazy that they even held him off for that long. That being said it obviously sets the stage for what happens when you have Hulk(hopefully not as weak/not ready to fight), Thor(with a new weapon), Iron Man, and Captain Marvel working together as the probable strongest avengers still alive at that time(and potentially in general aside from Doctor Strange and if Star Lord ever taps back into celestial powers) working together to fight him instead of being separated. Honestly at this point the rest of the team is really there as support. Other than Captain America and Vision(who depending on what happens with him could have different powers and/or weakened ones) who could put up a little bit of a fight everyone else(Black Widow, Hawkeye, War Machine, and Okoye don't compare to a full Infinity Gauntlet Thanos. The brains of the Mcu still alive(Shuri, Iron Man, Rocket, and Bruce) will have to help in other ways too.", "Many people glorify too much graphics. But the story is too messy. The water is rotten again. I have been subjected to evil. As well as being right", "This movie is bad as a alonestanding movie but i think in the series it is ok", "Sometimes you just want to hang in the couch and watch something and not think too much. Just be entertained and relax. Well, this movie isn't that relaxing. Lots of action, fighting, fast dialogue, many characters and change of locations. A dwarf, a racoon, a black panther, a spiderman, a robot, aliens and hulks. And all have some kind of supernatural power. Great kids stuff. Quality of acting or character development are not really main aims here. Effects, animations and stunts are really good. So, turn your mind off, grab some popcorn and enjoy. An hour after viewing you'll have forgotten you've seen it.", "Meh. At almost 2-1/2 hours, A:IW is a mish-mosh of tangled story threads that have no place in the same film, barely able to justify their absurdly overlong fight scenes, each of which includes ludicrously inconsistent strengths and weaknesses on both sides. Early snarky dialog gave me the impression that there would at least be the edgy humor that characterizes the best of the Marvel films, but the gaps between instances of such writing are huge to the point of boring. The story is thin, hard to believe (even for a Marvel film), and will be largely incomprehensible unless you remember almost everything from the eighteen other films in the franchise (or, as I was, are willing to pause repeatedly to Google up the answers to your questions). My teenage son often watches videos on his iPhone while simultaneously playing a game on his Nintendo Switch. I find it hard to believe he can really pay enough attention to know what's happening in a video while also playing a game. After watching \"Infinity War,\" however, I would recommend having a toy in your hands if you plan to see it.", "Marvel has become stale and repetitive. The plots to a lot of these movies seems to always repeat it self only under different characters and the CGI stuff is just fake as ****. Unfortunately I liked this one and I don't even know why. Maybe I'm on crack. I don't know. Anyways I really don't want to say anything more because I hate myself for even saying I like this garbage.", "(All of the Avengers plans involves massive casualties like Dr. Strange foreseeing the only possible future outcome out of 14 million and whatever stupid ass number the stupid ass writers of this thought up is to LET THANOS GET THE INFINITY STONES and kill everybody???? Or half of everybody I mean.... We need new superheroes/new writers in Hollywood/I Love This Movie!) Infinity War is 1 of my favorite movies. I love the 1st Avengers & I really love AoU for some reason but as much as I love this franchise (3rd favorite franchise behind LotR & Star Wars) this was a massive letdown. There's no intuitive story like the 1st 2. There's way too many jokes but Infinity War is hilarious it's just full of jokes that totally whiff like Starlord asking if his grenades are gonna blow off his crotch and Thor calling Rocket a rabbit not once, twice, but three times. Why is Thor such a dick? Why is Gamora such an idiot she runs right out into Thanos' trap and goes straight into his grasps so he can use her to sacrifice her to get the soul stone? Why is Starlord such an assface he punches Thanos right in the face just when their about to get the gauntlet off? Why is Hulk Bruce Banner???????? Why is Iron Man so strung out? Why is Spiderman such a doucheregal? Why is Dr. Strange so cynical? Why isn't Captain America and Black Panther and Black Widow in it more? Why are ALL the side villains computerized a couple of them should of been real persons?? Why are War Machine, Nebula, Falcon, Okoye, Wong, Winter Soldier and Shuri so badass in this movie 'cuz they are? Why aren't Groot and Rocket doing much together? Why is Loki in it? Why are Vision and Scarlet Witch the only Avengers that are acting in a manner that make sense????? \nWhy is Thanos so big and in it soooo much??? I love when Drax is acting like he's invisible and Mantis is like \"Hi, Drax.\" hahaha this movie really is hilarious Drax and Mantis are the best there's just way too many jokes and the action is beast but it's not very plot driven like the first movies were and THE AVENGERS NEVER REALLY ALL GET TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A PLAN AGAINST THANOS. I don't like that. That's really stupid. As much as I love this movie it was a huge letdown, God nobody cares about Thanos he's evil as ish. Just stop him. I care about the Avengers.

We have a kind of love-hate relationship. One moment I'm really enjoying the character or the story. At that time jealousy bubbles up and I wished I had those specific powers in my daily life. And sometimes I have absolutely no feelings about the superhero or I find the story not so fascinating. I surely can enjoy a Hulk movie because of the devastating power this superhero possesses. From \"Spiderman\", I like that youthful enthusiasm that Peter Parker radiates when discovering his new power. And in \"The Guardians of the Galaxy\", I appreciated the humor. Finally, \"Deadpool\" and \"Ant-man\" were refreshing. But when I watched \"Thor: Ragnarok\", I simply fell asleep. \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" I found so terribly confusing. After 20 minutes I no longer understood what it was about. And the whole \"X-men\" universe left me indifferent because of the lack of affinity I have with this club. It will be due to my not so great interest in superheroism. And every time, I come to the conclusion that all those superheroes are connected in one way or another, which makes it look like a web of facts and events. But \"Avengers: Infinity war\" was entertaining. First of all, because a large part of the Marvel clan appears in it. It's like a grand finale of all Marvel heroes. Together they try to join forces to prevent Thanos (Josh Brolin) from grabbing the six Infinity stones, so he can destroy half of the population in the universe with the snap of a finger. A simplistic idea of this super-villain to make life more pleasant on overcrowded planets. A purple environmental activist. He quickly gets hold of the first stones. However, the other two remaining stones are on Earth and require a little more effort from Thanos because they are surrounded by the remaining superheroes. What follows are sometimes hallucinating-looking battles and superhuman confrontations. As we are used to from the Marvel clan. I have to admit it. I was able to follow the story without difficulties (and that might have something to do with my age). Usually, the story isn't so clear for someone without much knowledge about this world of superheroes. You could even call the film exciting. That's no self-evident fact when it concerns unbeatable superheroes with unprecedented forces who seldom fear to be defeated. And you know they are going to use the well-known trick of resurrecting the seemingly defeated hero. Even though the situation seems hopeless, you can be sure that one of the heroes will put his butt on an intergalactic toilet where, after the necessary superhero-pushing, he'll produce some super weapon with which they shrink the bad guy to the size of a smurf, such that the universe is again saved from a catastrophe. To keep things simple, they've split the whole into a number of different storylines in different locations where a group of heroes each has their own fish to fry. This ensures a pleasant change and amusing interactions. Personally, I thought the conversations between Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.) at times quite hilarious. Even the inner battle of Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) with his character Hulk caused me to chuckle. Only occasionally the coincidence is really laughable. But isn't this characteristic of such a superhero flick? For example, Hulk is catapulted from an Asgardian spaceship and flies several light years through the universe, after which he lands with an immense smack on earth. And where? Through the roof of Dr. Strange's house. What a coincidence. When you think there's an oversupply of movies with superheroes in a latex suit and that the point of saturation had already been reached, then you can call this film an orgasmic highlight. And hats off to the makers for transforming this heterogeneous mixture of characters into a colorful whole. Certainly not a simple task. And even though I'm not a big supporter of sequels and I'm allergic to anything that smells like serials, I still look forward to the second part of this epic story. I wonder what one has to come up with in order to exceed this. That will be an impossible task. Even for superheroes.", "Is it just me or Mark Ruffalo just came from downtown to shoot some scenes and went back to shoping. In some of the scenes he is holding himself barely to burst into laugh. Like shots were filmed without cuting anything with him. Really awkward performance, like he have nothing to act at all... Went too much funny and puns for his character.\nThats just sums him up, rest of the movie is good, but expected more to be honest. There were many mistakes in CGI (in 20018), and saw better visuals two Avengers ago. Some part of story aren't logical and seems like there was many other ways to sort some plan/issue or whatever else. Not worst Marvel movie in past few years, far from best but at least killed 2 and half hours with it.", "Just a quickie. This film does well to hold up the standard of MCU films up until this points. The Russo Brothers to well to emulate the different feel of each and every character from other films like the Guardians. Most of the characters were pretty useless all in all. Cap did next to nothing, and to think this was meant to be the last film on his contact. There was a ton of action which, at the end, felt like noise. It feels like they pushed to have every single hero here whilst most were unnecessary additions. My main gripe is the deaths: Spoilers for Ant Man 2 btw. I realise that half the population on earth is about 3.5 billion but I think killing off pretty much everyone apart from the original team and Rocket was a bit overkill and convenient. All the Guardians are dead as well and the entire Ant Man team apart from Scott becuase the snap doesn't affect the quantum realm. Even Fury and Hill are gone. It's essentially just a big set up for Avengers 4, which is what annoys me. This film was hyped up for ages and as a fan of comic books and comic book movies in general I was really bloody excited but then it ended up being a huge set up with no real consequences. It's 100% obvious that anyone that turned to dust will be back. Holland is already filming Spiderman Far From Home, all the Guardians are filming Vol. 3, this was pretty much confirmed when Bautista threatened to quit over the Gunn controversy. Jackson and Smulders are filming Far From Home. It was annoying to say the least they these deaths were bigged up when they're all fake. Disney does not like to take risks. Loki dying is a grey area because I don't believe they would kill their most profitable villain and he's died before. Vision I believe is pretty much dead. Gamora is back for Guardians 3 so I'm unsure about her. We're all fairly certain that time travel will be involved in the next Avengers as well and one theory is that Shuri figures out a way to destroy the Infinity gems (yes I say gems because that's what they should be called) because she basically figured it out in IW, they go back in time and destroy all the stones before Thanos can get them which basically means Vision won't be coming back unless some sort of time paradox happens. Either way, the rate of the ones left alive is up in the air ironically. Basically, this film surfs on action and emotion but since the emotion is, for want of a better word, short-lived when you realise nothing sad actually happened, it basically works on action which echoes that of previous films. The emotion was high, despite as short as I felt it, especially Spiderman, but, in my honest opinion, I am going to wait until Avengers 4 to give see if this was a good or bad set up and if this was worth it. I hope it is.", "I am a huge fan of the comic series this is adapted from and was hoping it would be epic, like the comic book. It wasn't terrible (but alas not close to the awesomeness of the comic). Lately Marvel movies have been rather meh, this one was much better, maybe because it didn't focus on any on character for very long, had enough humor and action to keep the pace going. I am coming to the realization that these movies are really geared towards kids, and made entertaining enough so the parents won't be put off by watching. When I think about it like that 12 year old me would have been giving this a 10 and I would have wanted more more more. Out of the recent Marvel movies I have seen, Black Panther and Spider man, this one is the best, followed by Spiderman and Black Panther.  Looking forward to the next chapter.", "An American action thriller; The Avengers assemble for a third time and the result is an astonishing and sensate extravaganza, ambitious in scale, imaginative in backdrops and attractive settings thanks to some wonderful CGI rendering.\nThe movie's biggest accolade should be reserved for the writers who had to satisfy avid followers of the film series by featuring and distilling so many outlandish characters from previous sagas and still make it entertaining. The result was a success - the heroes' egos jam up alongside each other beautifully.\nRobert Downey Jr is on top form once more, and the Guardians of the Galaxy troop provide welcome comedic relief. Also, Thanos, is the most meaningful and personal antagonist of the series.\nAll in all it is an exciting epic, but with the dizzying array of heroes came a steady succession of overlong fighting sequences which occasionally lack a pulse and will become desensitising for some viewers who will say there's only so many times you can watch someone being kicked and punched through a wall.", "When every single superhero I'm the universe dies.", "Dark with a lot of fighting, just like all the avengers movies should have been. Of course the classic humour was not missing and was just about the right amount to keep it a good action movie rather than a comedy like the last movie, end game.", "Good movie!!The opening scene was insane with Ebony Maw's opening monologue!!But riddled with plot holes.Would have been better if the movie ended with the 'SNAP'!", "Not getting into the plot but definitely overhyped. The magic of the 1st avengers definitely lost, maybe intentionally done so but some of the acting and script seems forced. I can not think of one wow moment. CGI is great but overall the movie felt empty and without heart, again could be intentional. Let's see what part 2 brings.", "Gods of Marvel movies. Everything in this movies perfect. This movie will blow your mind.", "I was really curious if the Russo bros were able to handle so many characters into a coherent story. They were. And in a very entertaining way. Spoilers:\n", "This is probably the most heaviest movie of all time. In terms of scale, emotions and the rest. They just changed the stereotype with this one film and redefined marvel Cinematic universe.\nHats off Russo brothers.", "Another one film that touch the epic zone from Marvel. Infinity war has a superstar cast and for sure the producers has a very difficult job to do, because its not easy to fit all these characters in one movie. And the result its almost impressive.The film has also one of the most awesome villain, good action and humor. The ending was a bit ambiguous, but all the questions we have will get answer at the next avengers movie so, we are waiting!", "Really enjoyed the film pure escapeism with a few laughs would recomend", "The Movie Start Well & Ends Up Well ,, Looking Forward For The Next Avengers!!\nthe character of thanos makes you confused in a Good way !

I'm not sure why other reviews are so negative, I would just suggest watching it. It kept me entertained.", "Very interesting plot ....the ending is very sad but still very good, because it will be too much if everyone survive the infinity war", "Better than i thought it would be\nAction packed and still able to deliver the message\nExpected thanos to be more godlike \nBut all the same he is still great", "Oh my gosh all the feels that came about from this movie. I literally was thrilled and loving every bit of it and then the way it ended just made me mad/sad/angry, but all in all it was definitely a good movie and though i teared up a bit it was worth the watch.", "The movie that has been teased since 2012, and it does not disappoint. Enjoyable, fun, action packed, and tense.", "I watch this movies since i was a child.I love Marvel and I was waiting 10 years to this moment and it doesn't disappoint. The movie is awesome!!! Thanos is the best villain that i have ever seen. And see Avengers with Guardians is epic!! My favourite film.I am waiting very excited for Avengers 4!!", "Why black widow is more powerful than Capitain or Vision ??? This is ridiculous she has no super power or special cloth. They could stop Thanos many times but some people like Star-Lord o Doctor Strange or Wanda ruined everything.\nDoctor Strange saw future he could stop Star-Lord or let Stark die. Thanos couldn't bring Vision back without Time Stone and he couldn't kill half of the world without remaining 2 stones so they could defeat him.", "After 18 films and 10 years of building up to this moment, Avengers: Infinity War has finally been released. It is directed by Joe and Anthony Russo who also directed two other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Captain America 2 and 3. The film is a huge culmination of 18 films and 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Before the film was even released it was already bound to be huge as it had 2 unique selling points. The first is that Infinity War marks the first time that a feature-length movie has been filmed entirely on IMAX cameras. The 2nd is that the directors promised that several characters will be killed off which was something that fans wanted due to the argument that the films lack stakes if characters always survive. There are over 40 main characters in this film with pretty much every superhero from previous films making a return. These include: The Avengers, The Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-man, Doctor Strange and Black Panther and others as well as a lot of their supporting casts. Despite it being an Avengers film, the primary antagonist, Thanos, has the most screen time and we mainly go with him throughout his plan. This has the positive effect of making us sympathise with him and could arguably make an audience slightly agree with his points and motivation. Honestly, I believe that this was the right idea as it added more depth to Thanos' plan to collect all 6 infinity stones in order to wipeout half all life in the universe as apposed to some villains who seem to just be evil because they are evil. The film had a good level of balance. It wasn't trying too hard to be funny like some predecessors were however had some level of humor that we have come to expect from Marvel films by now. It was a joy seeing the mixture of some of the characters such as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Star Lord's ego fueled arguments and the Guardians of the Galaxy swooning over Thor's physique. Also, who didn't cheer when Thor, Rocket and Groot landed in Wakanda. There were some things that I expected to happen that didn't. For example, I thought Iron Man and Cap would reconcile after their fight in Civil War. But I guess we have Avengers 4 for that. Which brings me to the film's conclusion... At first it had me speechless. I genuinely could not believe that it was over. It played with many peoples emotions and honestly, there were grown people crying in the cinema (admitedly myself included).  Another thing that I would praise is the soundtrack. There are some parts of the films where the original score from the first film appeared such as when Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon appeared. However the theme does change later symbolising the darker tone. This is especially seen during the end-credits with the slow sound of the piano ending the theme. One negative thing I would say about it is that because of the amount of characters and amount of things going on, it is quite hard to keep up with it all. There were times when I forgot about certain characters and their motivation and I believe that this could put a lot of people off or make them lose interest. Another thing is that whilst some deaths were really heartbreaking, others were slightly less impactful as we can tell that they will return in the future which can lead you to wonder if none of these deaths actually matter. On the other hand though, we have to live with these deaths until 2019 when the currently untitled Avengers 4 is released. I would 100% recommend this film to fans of comic-book films and also to people who have a problem with them being repetitive as this film changes the norm of what would usually be seen. I heavily enjoyed this film and it is en-route to become one of my favourite films of all time, partly because of the sheer scale of it and partly because of the shock ending. This was a Thanos movie at heart and I would go far as calling him one of the best film villains of this decade. It did a stellar job of putting together a storyline that they had been building for 10 years whilst also getting people excited for the future.", "Before I get into it, I'd just like to say anyone here commenting 1/10 for this movie is straight up exaggerating. It was a colourful spectacle that kept most people on the edge of their seats with both funny and heartbreaking moments.  The storyline of this movie was interesting, but at times cliche. The whole Gamora and Thanos plot line was kind of to be expected, and half way through it I was basically saying to myself \"just get it over with!\". It shocked a lot of people, but it wasn't the most shocking death of the movie. The movie began with the deaths of beloved characters Heimdall and Loki. Loki being the more shocking of the two as a main character in the MCU and main antagonist of both Thor 1 and The Avengers. I didn't like his death because I think he deserved more than just a crack of the neck and meant to be gotten over in 5 minutes. I know it was meant for the shock factor, but I thought his death scene was lazy writing. Compared to his death in The Dark World, it seemed like he was just being tossed away as a character. The other deaths in the movie, such as the death of Vision, I thought were also dragged out. I was definitely left questioning why these characters (Vision and Gamora) got such long death scenes that wasted time but Loki was gone in a few minutes. Confusing. And on top of this, any other death in the movie was kind of average, and didn't give me a lot of emotion, because it's obvious the majority of them will be returning in the next movie. I mean, Spider-Man and Doctor Strange are dead supposedly, but they only have 1 film each so far. It seems predictable for the next movie's plot line.  The movie overall was good, except for these little things. It is also too long in my opinion, and each individual character didn't end up having much screen time since there are so many people in the movie. It had it's funny moments, sad moments, shocking ones etc. And I watched it three times in the cinema. I'm excited for Avengers 4, but the writing for this movie did seem a bit lazy at times, so that's one thing that lowers my expectations for the next one. People have all these intricate theories, but somehow I really don't think they'll come to the screen as the writers for this film didn't seem like they were thinking that deeply.", "Was expecting a lot and got more than I expected. \nReally great scenes, expanding the whole universe, bringing in aspects I've never seen before. All that was really cool. \nThe disappointing things- the major blunders come in the form of emotion overriding better judgement at clutch times. Just too trite and set-up. Thanos himself seems to be the best developed and even likable character in this movie. At least he can stifle his emotions to do what he feels he must. \nThe rest of the characters, with the exception of Dr. Strange, Thor, and Stark, seem confused by their emotions and let them dictate how they act and inevitably the end of the half of life in the universe. Yes, they are \"human\", but some aspects just seemed too derived and needless. At the end Thanos wins as his resolve is strongest, not because he is the strongest.", "Given my reluctance towards superhero movies, then I have been putting off watching \"Avengers: Infinity War\" up until now. I just simply don't do well with flying men, guys with strength above and beyond all measures, and the like. But I still watch the movies when I get presented with a chance, because of the special effects and because they do tend to have quite good special effects. I was given the chance to watch \"Avengers: Infinity War\" now, so I took the time to sit down and watch it. And I dare say that this was actually the best of all superhero movies that I have watched to date. Why? Well, because of the storyline and plot. Because this was so much deeper than a bunch of narcissistic guys and girls in tight spandex running around trying to - and succeeding every time - in saving the world and people they don't know. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" had a more dark tinge to it and it was nice for a change to see that the superheroes weren't invincible and coming out unscathed from whatever villain they take on. And the plot does actually leave you with something to think about; what if Thanos actually wasn't a villain, but one set out to actually do something that is waiting to happen, to purge worlds and give them a fresh start, as worlds are becoming overcrowded and a hazard to themselves with the pollution and such? If you watch the movie with that mindset then it suddenly becomes a whole different experience. The sheer amount of superheroes put together in this movie must be an overload for fans of the genre, I believe. Because there was an abundance of superhero characters everywhere. And personally, I found it quite refreshing to see that many of them met with untimely demises at the hands of Thanos or as a product of his schemes. Granted this being a Marvel movie, the special effects were off the charts. If you, like me, don't enjoy superhero movies all that much, then at least watch it for the eye candy in form of CGI and effects on the screen. But \"Avengers: Infinity War\" offers more than just CGI, because it actually has a plot that is worth delving into. But back to the effects; there were so many things going on all over the screen, that I think the movie should be watched a second time. The first time you watch it for the story, the second time to take in all the special effects and happenings on the screen. The cast list was just phenomenal, and I am impressed that they can assemble these people again and again to reprise their roles. But of course, with the salaries they are being paid, who wouldn't reprise such characters? \"Avengers: Infinity War\" actually presented a good and wholesome entertaining storyline that kept being interesting throughout the entire movie. I was more than entertained and was adequately surprised with the outcome of the movie. This might actually be just the kind of movie that persuades you to come to like the superhero genre. I was impressed, and that is saying a lot because I am definitely not a superhero fanboy.", "Despite watching this with raised expectations, I found it satisfactorily enjoyable.\nIn general, this movie is very entertaining. The story is great and has the kind of end it deserves. The villain is logical and realistic. The movie managed to cover so much details without haste.  I'm giving Avengers Infinity War a 10.", "Giving this movie 10 stars will be still considered under rated for me. 10 years of hype leading upto this and it did lived upto it. Can't get over this movie. Deserves a special place in heart. My favorite superhero movie of all time.", "Avengers: Infinity War is one of the best Marvel movie so far because of it's cinematography, performances, fight scenes and the ending is just too damn emotional. Iron Man, Spider-Man, Captain America, Thor & Doctor Strange was the real deal in this one! It's worth the watch and yet worth the 10 year wait since Iron Man.", "This was the ultimate best film this Summer2018! Can't wait to buy this movie and watch it again.", "The movie was average, nothing out of the ordinary. Marvel has already set the standard for the superhero movie and clearly doesn't plan on antagonizing the cash-flow formula of it's success. I will never understand the Black Panther lure and I don't consider it to be a legitimate superhero...and I've tried. Also bored with Evans as he just cannot act. Everything else was well done.", "One of the best Super Hero movies I have ever seen, Avengers: Infinity War blew me away. Seeing all the amazing super heroes in one movie was amazing, the story was great, and the villain Thanos is the great villain I have seen in a marvel movie. The effects were amazing and the action was at the edge of your seat.  Thanos, one of the most powerful beings in the universe is planning to gather the infinity stones, gems that will grant him powers beyond imagination. Earths super heroes the Avengers team up with Doctor Strange, Black Panther and the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him. Its a fight against one of the most powerful forces in the MCU. The story is very dramatic, and dark. One of the more darker stories in the MCU and its one of the best super hero movies I have seen, I am a Marvel fan and loved AIW it wasn't disappointing and it is a movie you want to see over and over again. To see a bunch of heroes in one gigantic movie was amazing, Of course I read the comic before I saw the movie and it was good, but I have to say that the movie was better. The story takes place in three perspectives, Guardians of the Galaxy and Iron Man and Spider Man, The Avengers on earth Captain America, Black Panther, Hulk ect. and Thor and Rocket Raccoon.  What I didn't know is a little bit of Ant Man and the Wasp also takes place in the story. The movie had good action scenes, and the characters had purposes. The ending blew me away with Thanos activating the Stones and having certain heroes disappear, there were some parts that brought tears to my eyes, the movie is very emotional and you don't get that a lot from super hero movies, but this one did. I can't wait for part two, the ending left me wanting more. And I believe part two will be more mind blowing then this first part.  10/10 for Avengers: Infinity War", "Ive always loved comic book movies and movies in general and this movie made me feel so many emotions. It made me laugh, it made me hyped and excited beyond belief and it made me cry several times. The MCU has been and will continue to be such an amazing journey.", "It's hard to say whether this movie would appeal to viewers not already immersed in the MCU Infinity Stones story arc but from my perspective as a die hard Marvel fan, this film is absolutely excellent. There's a lot of plot strands happening at once but the makers have done a great job of keeping it rattling along, coherent and above all exciting. Can't wait for 'Avengers 4'!", "Now. I know this review is coming more than 2months after the release of this film but I just had to say something about it. I have had more than enough time to give an unbiased view of this.\nAs the first movie i am reviewing i have to say it is one of the few marvel films i have genuinely enjoyed as this comes second on my list just after The Winter soldier\nNow on to the movie.\n1) The story is the usual conventional superhero stuff with Thanos wanting all the infinity stones to wipe out half the galaxy but how the Russo brothers convey this to the big screen is just awesome. It keeps you engaged and at the edge of your sit through out. \n2) Thanos is officially marvel's best and most relatable villain. He is very strong as potrayed in the movie's first scene and also incredibly smart amd dangerous. He has a human side to him that makes you as the viewer want to the empathize with him and oh boy does he do some damage at the end of this film\n3 The action in this movie is just amazing. Along with the acting. Tom holland's performance towards the end is one that made me tear up. Do I have to mention the captain america entrance and Thor's entrance??. Stuff that makes u clap and scream at the screen with satisfaction.\n As a whole this film is just so good especially in 3D and my only issue with film is that the cast is just too big and finding the right balance to this sometimes makes for some counky scenes especially in the beginning.\n Nicely done and props to Joe and Anthony russo!!!", "I lived the loki scenes, just that really. It is rich in characters, subplots and dynamics, much better than other avengers, but Loki is the best. Too bad what happens to him, in such silly way.", "This movie will break your heart in many ways, and the scene that hit me the most is the Black Panther always seen powerful saying this is no place to die and trying to stand up and disappearing.", "All round it was an excellent watch with plot twists that blow the audience away, this movie was a fun adventure with all of our favourite characters", "Infinity War is one of the best Marvel movies (and of the Superhero genre in general), but is not perfect. \nThe way the Russo brothers entangled all the stories of this past ten years is pretty good, and seeing all the near 30 characters of the MCU in one movie is a really cool fan service, but let's be realistic: the movie is a complete fan service. The weight of the movie is carried by 2 groups of heroes, leaving the rest of the cast there without doing something else that doesn't add much to the plot. One would expect to see all the characters together in the same scene, but some of these never met in the whole movie and didn't even do or say something remarkable. \nThat's the BIG flaw of this movie, but there are so many good stuff here, like the villain, Thanos, the best character in the whole movie. His motives and actions are very well justified and portrayed by Josh Brolin. He is a strong character with a strong personality, and he steals the movie. \nThe visuals are also very good, with a minor issues in some characters, who look like videogame PNJ. The music is so intense and is an emotional homage to the original Avengers soundtrack. \nAnyway, Infinity War is an enjoyable movie for superhero fans, and will be arguable considered as the \"best superhero movie ever\" by some easy-to-please fans and critics, but that's just a tag far from the reality.", "'Avengers: Infinity War' shouldn't have worked. It has over 20 major characters and only 149 minutes to fit them all into a cohesive story, but somehow Anthony and Joe Russo (along with screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus) managed to not only make it a good comic-book film, but one of the very best. The fact that it brings together multiple different franchises is a groundbreaking achievement in its own right, but the film actually accomplishes more than that. It's a film that's not afraid to take risks, one that takes audience expectations and completely smashes them, delivering something that stands out from the rest. The majority of characters are well balanced (apart from Steve Rogers, in my opinion) and the pacing never drags, aside from a couple of side-plots being slightly too long. The film also has a good handle on tone; it knows when to be funny, but never loses its sense of drama and fully delivers on its most serious moments. The action scenes (while mostly GCI driven) are all exciting and grand in scale, and the score by Alan Silvestri is one of his best in years. On top of all that, the film is always fun and has its fair share of epic goosebump-inducing moments. The ending of the film initially felt disappointing, but reflecting upon it made me realise that it was actually perfect and one of the things that makes the film so great. It's not the best film of the MCU, but the way in which it takes real risks and offers a genuinely unique experience elevates it to be one of the very best in its genre. 9/10", "I feel like this review needs to wait until the second part but the biggest thing I feared was putting all of the marvel characters in this movie was going to be forced but they tied this story very well to the other stories which they were planning on for years.. Definitely well thought out. Plus acting did not seem as cheesy as some (not most) marvel movies. One of Curious to see how 50% of earth/ avengers comes back to win. My only hope is that the follow up is not too cliche and that they are not afraid to kill off main characters, I rate this an 8 our of 10 for now unless the follow up flows very well with the whole story of thanos.", "The movie has unexpected end, and it was long but full of action and moments that would keep on edge. Overall, I really enjoyed how they related different heros from diffent places, and related the story to previous movies. 8 our of 10 Very Good.", "How can people give 1 or 2 rate for this wonderful movie?", "Did you like that catchy title? I just came up with it, and it's the opposite of what I thought this movie was. Never was I bored. Never was I without likeable characters. Never was I without good CGI (which is literally the entire point of any sci-fi/fantasy film. Overall, great. Worth the buy in 4K.", "Guys this is average movie at its best with pointless or cringeworthy scenes cheesey at times. ScreenRant channel of youtuhe has reviewed it in the best way possible. It feels like 80's melodrama at times and jokes are lame made only on character names. Instead of going smart way they go dumbest way possoble to kill Thanos. I urge viewers to be smart otherwise they are going to shovel the same shit down your throat again!", "This is an entertaining movie - or perhaps I should say, Half-Movie, because it's clear they have a lot of mopping up to do in the next installment. I see that as the major flaw in this movie. A secondary, but related problem is that though all the other Marvel flicks were interconnected, they were still fully independent stand-alone films. This one is not. If you haven't seen the other Marvel movies, this one is not going to make a lick of sense. I'm not going to rehash the flaws other reviewers have commented on, but I am wondering why more viewers aren't troubled by the fact that more than half the cast is over 40 and showing it - in some cases (Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey, Jr.) really showing it. That's a major problem for actors portraying superheroes. Even Scarlett Johansson, who is not one of the over-40's, is starting to look like somebody's mom (just check out those close-up shots in the Wakanda fight), and Chris Pratt truly is \"one sandwich away from fat\" these days. Benedict Cumberbatch is safe for a while - Doctor Strange was always gaunt and graying. The foregoing is not intended to be taken as age-discrimination, but rather as a possible answer to the question of why the movie ended as it did. Perhaps we'll soon be seeing a whole new cadre of Marvel Heroes...", "The movie gives you an amazing experience of superheroes and how some got together to stop thanos. The CGI was AMAZING!!!!! It took the 10 years to creat this amazing movie and it's worth it. The actors were awesome. It was worth every second of my life. I saw it 3 times and was not tired of it. It is the best movie of 2018 till now.", "Enjoyed this one, plenty of laughs, action and all your favourite characters. A few surprises at the end which sets up the next movie and has you wanting more. Another solid effort", "Fabulous.Marvel shows its capacity of affection,which builds up a legendary picture.", "I personally love this movie because IT IS AMAZING", "Since the first Avengers film in 2012, I've gradually fallen out of love with Marvel films. That being said, I was told this film was a must see- how right that is! All I must say is FINALLY an ending unlike any other. If you haven't seen it yet, you're truly missing out.", "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" comes at a time when I'm personally at superhero movie fatigue. With each addition to the MCU being the same fast food cinema of mediocre and enjoyable film consumption, I enjoyed \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and was pleasantly surprised at how much care and difference the film was given compared to the other members of its family.  The film is a culmination of an empire of superhero storytelling which gets seriously bogged down by its overcrowded palette of characters. The film essentially follows none of these heros but rather, to my pleasant surprise, mainly follow the antagonist and villain, Thanos, played by Josh Brolin. In many ways, he feels like the hero of the story due to how much attention the story gives him to convince the audience that this could be one of the best written villains in a superhero film every written. We understand this character to a depth that was honestly alarming and fascinating. Each scene builds on the next to carefully create a character we go from hating, to want to see him succeed.  Thanos is definitely the best aspect of this film and him itself gives the film a massive advantage over its many flaws and criticisms. In keeping in line with the film's writing, since much attention is given to Thanos, we are given a disappointing inbalance in hero characters that share the screen. None of which really developed arcs or changes we see in the film. Despite the overall disappointing characterization, stakes are higher than they ever have been. This again goes back to the phenomenal protagonistic villain and well orchestrated action sequences.  Additional complaints about the script include truly head-scratching plot holes and questions like, \"How did he get there?' 'Why didn't she just do that?\" Many of these questions, that appear throughout the film genuinely matter since they took me out of the film and made me question things I should not have been worrying about. Better care definitely could've been taken into creating a more cohesive and consistent plot that makes more logical sense that it deserves.  Visual effects on this film is fantastic and nothing else really needs to be said on this front. CGI's detail and scope is something to be studied by aspiring visual effects artists. General look definitely reflects the talented directors, the Russo Brothers. They prove once again that they understand what makes a film exciting and enjoyable to watch.  Despite my issues with \"Avengers: Infinity War\" it honestly was such a surprise and enjoyable film to watch. It felt refreshing despite its darker and heavier tone and will be much more remembered than the past 10 additions to the MCU. This finally felt like an epic story rather than an inconsequential episode to the fast food cinematic machine that the MCU has become. This one is definitely worthy of the praise and massive revenue its received.", "Well, well, well... there's no messing around in the eagerly anticipated Avengers 4 movie is there. Straight into the action, picking up where we left off in other Marvel films including \"Thor (3) - Ragnorak\", \"Black Panther\" (Cpt America Civil War\" and even \"Guardians of the Galaxy 2\". The Mad Titan, Thanos (Josh Brolin), and his minions are hunting down infinity stones - mystic gems which were formed at the beginning of the universe and which, when combined give their owner God-like powers. Thanos wants to reshape the universe. The only obstacles to him getting the stones and the power are Earth mightiest heroes, The Avengers (and friends). PRO\nWith 31 Marvel movie's before this - Infinity War turned out to be an epic come together of (nearly) all the established Marvel characters. This throws up some interesting cross-over combinations and situations and with it some fun humour. PRO\nSorry, this is a spoiler - but as I've left writing this review until the film was out of cinemas I'm sure you have heard far worse by now... it's nice to see the bad guys triumph. It gave me the same goose bumps that \"Star Wars: Empire strikes back\" did when I first saw that, many, many years ago.\nYou can't get bored - it's too quick and jam-packed to get bored. In this approach it was very comic book paced, it flitted from one scenario to another and then back again. Every frame is packed with something - from the opening to the close there is something to see or learn. By the same token this was also a negative. I'm not sure that the constant hopping around worked as well as it could have done in cinematic format, but I don't want to mark the film down on this because it was actually a bit unique in the way it handled this -with so many characters it was bound to do this to get everybody in but I have to ask, did it develop as much as it could do before moving on?. If the follow up film delivers on the situations which have been set up, then it may yet turn out to be a massive triumph. CON\nIt wasn't like the comic version of Infinity Wars - motivations are different, and characters involved are different. Despite this I have to be realistic with myself - Lady Death would probably be hard to create without looking too CGI'd, as would the cosmic entity's that battle Thanos - they would probably look stupid floating through space. CON\nOccasionally felt a bit CGI - not on the level of DC films such as \"Justice League\", but for Marvel this felt a little less than excellent which they've predominantly done so well. After reading a lot of other reviews people seem to be reacting negatively to the characters that die only to potentially be coming back - I didn't get this point of view I'm afraid. Doesn't that happen regularly in comic books? Don't characters face their doom countless times only to be resurrected? How many times has Captain America died in comic books for god sake?! How many times have Wolverine or Deadpool suffered wounds that would destroy them regardless of their healing powers? How many times has Tony Stark been captured and assumed dead, only for the shareholders trying to take over his business been disappointed that he was alive and well. It happens all the time. The way I see it is this, there's the Marvel multiverse - what happens in films isn't the same universe as the comics or the films aren't accurate in their portrayal. When somebody dies but the next episode or film they are back and there's no real explanation - it's probably just another reality or universe where everything is OK or never actually happened. If it isn't the case then all the normal humans populating earth are dumb as fudge ants that deserve to be stamped on by a might God-like entity. Anyway - I digress! Sorry. The film was epic, fast paced, good fun and action packed. I would definitely watch it again, and probably will before I go the next installment at the cinema. I enjoyed this and haven't met anyone that didn't take some enjoyment out of it. The only people that seemingly didn't enjoy it are the keyboard warriors who like to give 0's and 1 star reviews on here rather than look for something positive. I'm giving this 8 out of 10 - but I'm hanging on to a spare star till after the follow up. I solemnly promise that if all arcs are resolved and everything is placated then I will return and award that additional star, if this review says anything other than 8 - then I either haven't seen the next film yet, it's not been released yet, or it stunk! EDIT: I came back to upgrade this to a 9/10. Well done.", "Spanning 10 years and across over 18 films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's penultimate climax certainly has a lot to live up to, so the question on everyone's mind is naturally: does it live up to the hype? In short... yes (at least for me personally)! All those who felt the creeping sensation of 'superhero fatigue' may rest at ease - all the tropes, cliches and stereotypes previously associated with Marvel films are essentially thrown out the window in favour of a fascinatingly character-focused action/sci-fi flick (although the film's ending leans closer to horror). Where films like Justice League, X-Men, Civil War and even this film's predecessor, Age of Ultron, struggled to allow their large, colourful roster of characters the necessary breathing air and screen-time, Infinity War soars above and beyond in delivering a much-needed 'Empire Strikes Back' approach in splitting the crew apart into seperate factions and subplots. Even despite this, the first half of this admirably lengthy film does, at times, feel choppy. While their inclusion is otherwise seamless, jumping from the Guardians' upbeat, quirky tone to the downbeat, Earth-bound Avengers is admittedly a little jarring at times. The effects are fittingly grandiose and epic, as is the action, which helps to justify the 'War' in the title. Overall, it's a film that functions better as an event and payoff for years of ticket purchases and fan commitment than it does as a singular story, and I for one firmly believe it's all the better for it.", "Too a long time fan of the Marvel cinematic Universe this movie has the charm of the marvel movies while still pulling your heart strings", "So Avengers: Infinity War finally arrived in theaters and I went to see it after a long wait for this one. And I cannot believe what I just saw. The ending will make you think to yourself did this really happen. Every character on its own has its surprising role to it. Before I start, I want to say that this a spoiler review. So if you haven't seen it I want you to see the movie for yourself and then comeback and visit the review. So starting off we left off where Thor: Ragnarok finished with end credits scene. First of all Thanos attacks the spaceship and also Thor and Loki are there too and Loki decides to bring Hulk to fight him off. I thought that this is the best opening a film can get. Thanos then decides to send him to earth. But he also attempts to kill Loki. Moving on I was surprised the fact he died right off the beginning of the film as it was predictable too. We cut Doctor Strange, Tony, Wong and Banner discussing about Thanos coming to destroy half of the humanity. This scene was okay but the best part was about Tony wanting to call Steve but he realizes somethings wrong and he leaves. So after that the big battle happens in New York and we also see the 5 heroes in action including Spider-Man. So Peter arrives to help out Tony but they decide to pay a visit inside the spaceship. So far the movie was going good until the part where they introduce the Guardians. I thought that was too much added. It felt like a 10 minute scene which was really not needed. Later on some good action sequences happen and we see Captain America making a appearance stepping out of the dark. Steve, Romanoff and Sam are there to help Vision and Wanda. I don't get why Steve needed to help them because both Vision and Wanda are very strong. So lets talk about the action in this. The action has a very good feel to it as the battle of Wakanda happen and where half of the Avengers are in space. We see the transition between Space and Wakanda during those fight scenes. This movie also has a lot of CGI which I don't think it needed that much. So let's talk about the best thing about this movie and that was Thor's arrival in Wakanda everyone cheered so much at my theater and it was just so awesome to see. The battle was clearly the best. But one thing that was disappointing was some of the shots and scenes from the trailers that don't make it in the movie. I remember a few of them in fact there was a deleted scene of Thor getting his hammer which didn't make it into the movie so that was quite bad. We also didn't get to see Hulk in action but in fact we saw him in Tony's Hulkbuster armor the whole time. So it was very weird how the trailers show Hulk as usual but the movie is very different from the trailers. Though we never see Cap and Tony meeting each other in the movie as to they have their own duty to do. The main thing is the ending. The ending was out of place for a bit but then we clearly get to see the snap from what Gamora said that \"He could do it with snap of his fingers\" and that's what this is about as he destroys half of the humanity. And the only survivors we get were the main original avengers. To me this was kind of disappointing as to one of the main Avengers should die like Iron Man which he didn't. I thought that Iron Man or Cap would've died in the movie but that did not happen. But I think that the movie was good accept the two characters did not show up in this movie like Hawkeye and Ant-Man. The end credits was really not needed and it was one of the worst end credit scenes that I've seen in this movie and that was Nick Fury and Maria Hill just making an appearance near the end of the film and this was just bad. Later we see that Captain Marvel reference. Overall this movie was a good movie accept some of the character performances were bad like Star-Lord was just so bad in this film and also some characters like Wanda. Overall I would give Avengers: Infinity War a 7/10. I though think that this movie might get an extended cut because this movie was 2hr 30m. And I still think an extended cut will fill in the gaps by making it a 2hr 36m movie. So I hope you have enjoyed this review and that's just my opinion on the movie.", "I swear I'm not a cynic that wants to watch the world burn. I liked the movie; in fact, I might see it again, but is it deserving of the box-office Hulk smashing and saying it is the best Marvel film over the past decade? Well, I don't think so. I've contemplated doing a ranking of the Marvel films, but we can save that for later. Also, with so much going on and so much safeguarding that has happened, I'll do my initial review and then clearly mark a spoiler section afterward where we really discuss the juicy stuff if you're one of the 12 people left that hasn't seen this film. I saw it a week ago, and I still felt like I was late to it.  So many characters. It hurts trying to think of everybody that appeared in this film. Some shined more than others. The directors did a wonderful job of making sure the tone of each franchise was appropriate. The improv heavy Thor: Ragnarok shown through with Thor and Hulk, the galaxy guards felt right, and Black Panther and Wakanda all made sense. So they got the vibe down. But not all individual characters were consistent. Let's try to go down the list: Iron Man: Tony is mostly a success in this film Thor: I'd argue that Thor is the star and is given some of the greatest moments. I do have to say, however, that there is a fight scene where Thor flies up and the half second shot of him was the most egregious CGI in awhile. Captain America: He does his part. Nothing else to note really Bruce Banner: Really tried putting on the cheese, and I think of all the humor, his missed the most. Doctor Strange: Plays a nice role, but Tony Stark honestly does overshadow him. Spider-Man: More hit or miss than in Civil War, but I'm still a Spidey fan. Black Widow: Would be totally forgettable except that it's impossible to forget Scarlett Johansson. God bless. The Guardians: We'll discuss controversy with Star-Lord later, and despite some good moments, he also had his own missteps. Drax was the best part about Vol. 2, and he was the funniest thing about this movie as well-love the big dude, especially when he plays comedically off of Mantis (one of Drax's funniest lines about Gamora was also improvised, just fyi). Groot and Rocket Rabbit Raccoon are great. I like Gamora, but I was hoping for more depth. Vision: I'm a Paul Bettany fan, and he dominated the previous Avengers film, but he was trash in this film. Scarlet Witch: She brings good contrast to Vision. Black Panther: Not given enough screen time, but he's a bright side.  There are others like Nebula and Falcon, but I just can't do anymore. Oh, but one more character of note is Peter Dinklage. That guy is great. Okay, enough about the heroes. I'm looking forward to seeing Cable in Deadpool 2, but Josh Brolin is fantastic as Thanos in this film. I do get a bit tired of his motion-capture face with all the other CGI that goes on during the impressive film, but he represents a real threat-and as a fully realized character. It's truly a joy to watch, and you never know what to expect when he appears in a scene.  Look, here's what I'm most upset about the film. It didn't quite bring the magic I wanted (not talking about Strange either). When The Avengers came out and we watched that cast save New York, that was a blast. There are glimpses during some of the fights of enjoying what can happen when all these heroes come and fight together, but it never fully engaged me. And the way the story plays out, there was never really a chance for it.  I could tell there were some strange transitions due to trying to cut the film down, but I was mostly impressed by the editing. It's a gargantuan film and not an easy task. Like refrain from the large soda because it is a long movie, but it works out decently well. I will discuss more in detail the spoiler section below, but I had problems with the opening, and the ending did not affect me all that much. It's a long, CGI filled movie with so many stars that mostly are balanced out. It's entertaining, and it really is fun to watch in theaters. But is it still overhyped? Yeah. Yeah, it kinda is. --SPOILERS-  I hate what happened in the opening scene. The idea behind it is obviously that hey, Thanos easily attacks the remains of the Asgardians, and it is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the film. RIP to Idris Elba, a great part about the Thor trilogy, but I'm not 100% yet that Loki is dead. He's died before, and even Thor contemplates about it. But anyways, 2 big players die in the opening. That's supposed to set the tone for the rest of the movie and wants to say to the audience, hey, this is the kind of Avengers film this is going to be. Get ready to say bye-bye to many of your heroes... But then, that didn't really happen. Gamora had her green blood spilt, and Vision was destroyed, but that was really it. One of those was a latter half death and the other was in the climax. They almost killed Tony, but they chickened out of that death and made Doctor Strange give in (a nice emotional moment, but no deaths). If they don't clean up their act and actually kill big people off next year, I will be upset.  People are speculating all over the ending, but I'm honestly just a bit meh over it. Firstly, after thinking it over, I don't blame Star-Lord for going berserk on Titan and ruining the plan. Like the love of his life was murdered, so I don't blame his reaction. Side note-the biggest glimmer I talked about earlier with the fight scenes was the fight with Thanos on Titan. Like Spidey jumping through Strange's portals and delivering blows with one-liners is fun. And earlier seeing him use Stark gadgets to aid him in the fight is cool too. But alas. The biggest reason I'm not concerned over what the ending really means or what will happen is that Black Panther is one of the ones that dissolved. We all know for a fact that Black Panther isn't actually dead, and that alone is enough to convince me not to worry about half the population being disintegrated. And since I wasn't all that worried, it didn't really hit the emotional level it wanted me too; however, of all the characters, Tom Holland's disappearance was really well done. Also, when Doctor Strange was looking at all those futures, he mentions that of the millions of possibilities, they only won once. And right before he disappears, he tells Tony that this was the only way. So again, I have no idea how the Avengers manages to fix this, but I know it will happen somehow, and as the end credits tell, we're not done with Thanos yet-even if he is currently watching his sunset on his summer break.  Predictions for Avengers 4: I honestly have done very little thinking on this, but here goes. Unlike popular belief, Captain America won't die; he will probably hang up his shield though. Since they scared us once in this film, Iron Man won't die either. Maybe someone like Bucky, er Winter Soldier, er White Wolf will sacrifice himself. Uh, Black Widow still hasn't gotten a solo film, and I think the origin films are getting a little old, so maybe she won't die. I think Marky Mark Ruffalo will get some moments as the big green guy, but he ultimately dies. I'm not sure how stuff gets reversed, but it could have something to do with the Time Stone. What I'm really trying to say is that I have no idea what will happen. I'm not losing any sleep over it, but I will be sure to check it out next year.\nYou can find this review and dozens of others at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com", "Avengers: Infinity War Continuing the blockbuster series: a massive gang of comic book super-heroes attempt to stop the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) from obtaining all six of the all-powerful Infinity Stones which would give him ultimate power to dominate the entire universe. Like many big-budget blockbusters (BBBs), this one falls into the usual trap of too much happening and too many people to try to remember. Adding to this problem are too many corny jokes and some really bad attempts at humour. Also like other BBBs, \"Infinity War\" has superb special effects, action scenes, and other aspects of technical superiority. The pluses mostly outweigh the minuses though not always. Still, there are moving scenes in the second half that raise the film to a higher level. Credit must be given for a very bold ending which is a welcome contradiction to traditional narratives. So, despite some obvious flaws, \"Infinity War\" is still entertaining.", "Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr Bruce Banner is pitiful in this film, he comes across as a bumbling idiot in there to throw in a couple of cheap laughs for the idiots not the clever Doctor who accidentally created The Hulk. It was massively cringeworthy, especially when he is in the Hulkbuster and delivers lines like 'This thing kicked the Hulks Ass!' and having his two way conversations with his inner-hulk trying to entice him out like he's trying to convince his mate to come out on a pub/bar crawl. There did seem to be too much going off in the film with varying storylines but I applaud the level of emotion in the characters, particularly Thanos who whilst is a 'Mad Titan' is doing what he is doing for the greater good of the universe in his own mind and making his own personal sacrifices along the way rather than just doing it 'because he is bad' Take out Mark Ruffalo for the 2nd part please, bring Edward Norton back if you like but just get rid of Mark Ruffalo", "Marvel Studios laid all of the groundwork for what should've been the greatest Marvel film. But they hired the bland-as-hell directing team of the Russo Brothers again.  Minus One star for their direction which lacks focus. It feels like they are just organizing actors, not directing them. So many wide shots with people standing around just talking or fighting. Minus One star for the overdone, unrealistic CGI backgrounds. The only locales that look real are the ones taking place in NYC. Way too much green screen. Minus One star for some of the false emotional beats. I felt a little embarrassed for getting all sad about one particular character's demise when I realized they were just setting us up for a big \"Gotcha!\" moment with the next Avengers movie.", "Highly expected.But I think its plot is so simple (And imdbchinese character is illegal?)", "Avengers: Infinity War packs quite a punch and after 10 years manages to tie together its universe.  This was a good film, it had strong points and it had disappointments as well. The fighting scenes and some touching moments were well done but at the same time the elements that have led Marvel produce some of the best superhero films were not there. Granted this was a more serious film but the humor was lacking. Captain America did not have his shield, the Avengers didn't fully unite but fought in different parts. Steve and Iron Man didn't even share a scene together. What might have been better could have been having those separate fights in other realms and later having the whole team fight together on Wakanda. To me the biggest issue was pace, Marvel films excel at having great space and making great use of their time. This film had a slow pace at the start and sadly a bit boring sometimes.  To me the film to beautifully tie their universe together was Civil War. This was a great film that devoted time to each hero, pitted them in a great match up and showed off their strengths. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but after all the hype I expected more. Pretty good but not great, other films such as Thor Rangarok, Spider Man and Ant Man hit it out of the park. Thanos was a great villain and Josh Brolin deserves praise. It was sad to see our heroes disappear but I am excited to see what's next. This was surely part 1 and part 2 will be the film that might live up and exceed expectations. It was realistic to have him win round 1 to make for an even great round 2.  7/10", "First announcement of releasing Avengers I was excited especially with the unbelievable rating -almost 9!-, but it's no different then any other super hero movie except this time it's \"to be continued\".\nanyhow it's worth watching for a no brainier no emotion time, I still refuse to watch the guardian of the galaxy and captain America and Avengers require to know these character in advance.\nI'm so exited for opening movie theaters in Saudi that's why I felt generous with the rating.\nIf I could make an exception, defiantly Tim Holland, will done!", "Given that Marvel studio has already abandoned the effort to build a world view in the any sequel film. Therefore, before that meaningless random massacre came, the film basically guaranteed an effective rhythm of storytelling to the fans.\nHowever, after the construction of the story has been established, it is not appropriate to try to create a sense of tragedy with mechanical superposition.\nIt is not so much a breakthrough; it is more like an opportunistic fraud.", "There was good action throughout this movie starting just a few minutes in and some moments of pretty funny humor. There were also a few obviously stupid choices by the characters that were obviously done that way so they could drag out the story to infinity and beyond. One was with Star Lord and another stupid choice was made by Thor. I won't say what they were but if you see the movie you will know. Anyway, I was a little disappointed in the movie overall. Hopefully the sequel is better. Hopefully there is only one sequel and they don't drag it out for 3 or 4 movies.", "The movie was good by itself but the ending had pissed me off and I didn't even know about the post credit scene until three days later and I feel like the post credit scene was the thing that calmed me down", "The movie definately had some good action scenes and an interesting storyline. However Thanos' power seemed to fluctuate during the entire movie, which was often confusing. However I did sympathize with thanos and I thought he was a great villain with a clear objective.\nI was afraid that the overwhelming amount of characters would make the movie overly-chaotic, but i have to admit that it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. As I am a big marvel fan I did like this movie, however from an objective point of view the movie is often inconsistent and incomplete. You didn't really have time to relate to the characters, but the blame lies with the astonishing quantity of characters and it was to be expected. I rate this movie 7/10, because it didn't live up to the expectations whatshowever. It does however leave you with a desire to see the sequel. Hopefully they'll nail this one.", "For me it wasn't worth the wait. Captain America : Civil War had a better story line. Infinity War was not my favorite Avengers movie but at least it was better than Justice League!!!!", "Good, entertaining, creative summer popcorn flick. Nothing special or groundbreaking though.", "The Avengers : Infinity War is not going to win Best Picture, but hey as an excuse to sit in a comfortable seat in an air conditioned theater and munch popcorn, it does the trick! \nThis film is way too difficult to talk about without spoilers. So much stuff here. I will keep everything to a general nature.\nThis is a ensemble of Marvel characters, both good and bad. Amazing to see the multi-protagonist story structure done this deftly. George Lucas is a master at it, and well, it appears that the director here attempted to emulate him....it is a workable effort. The first act is re-introducing us to characters we all know (with a great entry by Captain America). The second act does the best it can, slipping into formulaic action and one-liners. But there is reprieve! The third act delivers a multi-layered, thought-out ending coupled with an awesome post credits easter egg scene that leads into the next film. So please folks, catch that last scene. *Just as a helpful FYI - as soon as the credits roll, there is enough time to visit the lavatory and return to view the final scene...about 5 minutes, I'd say.\nIt is a long film, be mindful of that. There is much violence also, parents be advised. \nMy overall impression that this film succeeds at connecting the dots (albeit we all can see what it was without the dots being connected). It is rather predictable. Some scenes, either overtly or subtly, are telegraphed to us. I am not sure if this was deliberate or desperate. You be the judge.", "SPOILER: The action and special effects are terrific, I loved it. But I was waiting so much of this movie... the end of 10 years expectations ! The characters, except Thanos, they are so dull... they don't get the chance to interact as they're use to. There is so many characters that the humour is just about childish jokes, no real talk, not even subtil humour for the end of the univers... after all why don't we laugh when our friend and everybody are diying or going to die", "First things First. This is a good movie. Enjoyable and sort of entertaining to a point.\nThey really marketed it well with the secret leaks to the ending, killing off many characters etc. etc. They surely had me fooled and apparently almost 90% of the world's population(Who have not even realized it yet). \nThe first 20 mins of this movie are seriously good and they build up nicely to an middle and an end that falls flatly on the ground. Thanos is the most important character in the movie(as the trailers and the marketing team has made apparent). He alternates between being strong and being weak, being a badass and then a softie entirely for the convenience of the plot. There are no other characters that are given that much importance, seriously. Everyone makes an appearance though, and have their comic one liners but all for nothing.Captain America is virtually absent from the movie (except during his entrance scene). Black Panther is also an observer, so is Winter Soldier and Hulk, Yes u heard it right, Hulk is not there in the movie. Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man , Thor and Guardians have a better amount of screen time. Then comes the ending, which I am confident was a late patch up thing and not well thought of. In the end you are left wondering weather you have liked this movie or not? I have liked it but only Just.", "...the nagging feeling in the back of your mind that no Marvel hero ever truly, permanently dies will undermine a lot of the emotional poignancy Infinity War tries so hard to convey.", "...the nagging certainty in the back of your mind that no Marvel hero will ever truly, permanently die inevitably undermines a lot of the emotional poignancy Infinity War tries so hard to convey.", "A very good attempt. The Marvel movies of today come closer to the strengths of comic books story telling: complex stories told on many narrative strings summing up to big finals. Digital art of today can provide the means to bring actors in real-live superheros feeling. A lot of this movie is to be liked. But the Marvel team should go back - one more time - to study further the story telling of the comic books. All good drawn stories do not go on with action scenes over pages and pages. That would be to boring and page-wasting for the reader. Action itself is done within very few pictures in comic books. One \"wham!\" and one \"peng!\". That's it. Nobody is interested in 10 pages of \"wham\" and \"peng!\". The needed action scenes are shortened in comic books (the fantasy of the reader jumps in) and the won comic book frames can be filled with in-between stories of love, hate, relation, politics, kisses, needings and longings of human beings universal told with the over-aggregated means of superheros. So please, reduce the time wasted on action scenes. Stay closer with the tellings of comic books. With each step the Marvel and the DC-teams go closer to the art of the telling in comic books, the better the movies have become. In Infinity War the grandios final would have been still more grandios with a reduction of the battle scenes to an absolute minimum. The first comic-movie that will dare to use an absolute minimum of time for battle scenes will come up with fantastic stories, I am sure.", "It definitely wasn't as good as a stand alone marvels movie, but it was okay. I thought bk that maybe they should have chosen different directors.", "The evil powerful Thanos is on a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, which will destroy 50 percent of the whole galaxys population, only a group of superheroes stand in his way. With its ensemble cast (too many to mention) Avengers: Infinity War is almost wall to wall nonstop action with comic book quips throughout. Thanos is surprisingly likeable in parts and adds some emotional weight making the story more dynamic. Viewers to make sense of chaos on the backdrop of outstanding effects, fantastic sets and outlandish costumes may want to watch Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok to name a few essentials to make sense of the sacrifice and devastation on display. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo offer an enjoyable film with surprise deaths of beloved characters (Loki in the first few minutes) scattered over its well paced lengthy running time, which whizzes by. While older comic book readers may not be able to work out why these on screen character don't have that secret je ne sais quoi of their paper counterparts, ultra geeks and readers of more recent comic series will no doubt find it a movie Marvel blast. Unlikely characters are paired together, creating some enjoyable comedy, tension and action moments as the story gets bleaker and bleaker for our heroes. With some sharp editing and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely leave Infinity War on a cliffhanger not seen since The Empire Strikes Back*. Or for those who will never watch another Marvel instalment, behold the most nihilistic ending to a comic book film ever. *There's the obligatory after credit scene where Nick Fury calls on Captain Marvel to help Marvel film fans sleep at night until the next installment.", "I recently saw Avengers: Infinity War and I thought it was a good film. I went into this film expecting to see some great actions and banter from the cast and I just about got that. I like that the story kept itself simple (although it sometimes does seem like the films in a bit of a hurry for Thanos to get the Infinity Stones) and doesn't try to be darker than it needs to be or trying hard to be funny. The cast worked well off each other and honestly it's amazing that the Russo Brothers managed to make a film like this work so well with such a gigantic cast. If it were poorly directed than it could've been a huge, cluttered mess and probably unwatchable. The visuals were decent and the action scenes, while not as thrilling as, lets say, the first Avengers film, were fun to watch. Seeing the Guardians of the Galaxy cast with the rest of the Avengers was a joy to watch and I feel that the run-time was just right (Despite being over 2 hours long which I didn't even notice). However the best part of the film is Thanos. It's really good to have a Marvel villain that not only doesn't suck and have a lack of screen time (cough 'Yellow Jacket' cough), but actually be threatening and interesting. Like a good villain should be. He definitely makes the viewing all the MCU movies worth it and I can't wait to see more of him. However the film uses the death fake-out a little bit with certain characters. Where you think one character will die only to be survive and not be killed at all (although it's not as bad as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy). I also wasn't interested with a part involving Thor, Rocket and Groot in the middle of the film and (while I did praise the film for managing a big cast well) some characters don't have much of a role within the film. That mostly being Dr. Strange, The Guardians, War-Machine and even Captain America. It's also a film that I don't see much re-watch value in. It's like Mad Max: Fury Road for me, once I've seen it there's not much reason to watch it again. Overall I thought Infinity War was a pretty good film and I suggest to any fan of superhero movies to watch it although you probably already have seen it or just going to see it.", "If you fan of the superhero action fantasy movies, you also like this film. Well, I never been comic action hero fan, and also I never been a fan of marvel's film universe. In the past I like some animation DC and Marvel cartoons. Despite this rarely have some comic adaptation, which I love it, like the V, for Vendetta, or Sin City, or Watchman. Marvel's universe really far from this, but honestly marvel's have a certain style, which is enjoyable but in my opinion a little mediocrit. However, Marvel's have some EPIC films, like the best marvel film, the LOGAN, or Winter Soldier and Civil War which is really good. Honestly I want to see this film, I don't know why, maybe the hypetrain hit me a bit of.... but I total disappointing after the film. In point of fact, the film is like many other marvel films, a sci-fi/fantasy with superheroes and funny feeling. And in this film, have a very good antagonist. Bit firsty, technically things total ruined caused by the 30 main charater. The film rushed the scenes, without transitional sceens. Over and above the forced jokes total ruins the drama factor, without the jokes it is maybe works more and more better, I thought. Some main heroes barely can we see, like Steve Rogers, he has 10-15 words in the whole film.  But talk about the antagonist, who is the best character of this marvel universe. He has a good motivation, a - little messy, but - good character development, so he is an interesting character. Nevertheless, he has a interesting but total messy plan, and ideology. Clearly THANOS PLAN IS A Crapshoot! I do not a pacifist, so if he's mayhem works do it, but it isn't.... definitely it is an exact problem, but if anybody have some expertise about History or Geography he knows that this plan isn't works.  The Overpopulation and starvation doesent solved if we cut half the population, it is delayed the problems but doesent solved.", "The Russo brothers have done it again. They have successfully brought together a massive roster of characters created by different writers into one jaw-dropping,action packed and exciting film. Infinity War is the near-perfect reflection of everything Marvel has done in the last 10 years. 3 years after the events of Civil War, the Avengers are now seperated. But when Thanos- their biggest rival shows up, the former allies have to set aside their differences and stand together against Thanos with the help of the Guardians and the people of Wakanda. The film's plot was rather simple, but it had no major plot holes and was very easy to get abreast of. It was the characters that formed this blockbuster. I loved how the Russos set up the storylines for each chracters in the film. All of them shined and you will remember every single character. The acting was obviously fantastic. But the best performance in this film goes to Josh Brolin. He successfully betrayed one of Marvel's greatest villian yet and prooved why Thanos is the biggest and the baddest villain in the MCU. He will make Keaton's Vulture and Jordan's Killmonger look meh by comparison. The best part is how different characters are set in different tones. For example, when the scene moves to the Avengers, everything gets a bit dramactic and more serious whereas every time the Guardians show up its all laugh-out-loud.That along with the epic soundtrack formed a great amotsphere in every shot. However, the Black Order was somewhat a disappointment in this film. They had very little screen time and was not as frightening as we saw in the trailers. The only negative part of the film is probalbly the tempo. The film was a bit too fast-paced, which was hard to catch up with sometimes. But I think it's understandable as there are over 70 major characters in this film. The filmmakes wanted to make sure that everyone has a spot in this epic showdown. There's just so much to say about this film, but I will have to pass because I do not want to spoil anything. Infinity War may not be the best film Marvel has made and it has some problems here and there, but it is a satisfying ending to a 10-year period of Marvel domination. It's definitely worth 2 hour 36 mins of your life. I would recommend seeing it in theaters at least 2 times because you may miss out on a lot of interseting details", "Avengers: Infinity War is popcorn spectacle of the highest order, bringing action scene after action scene with barely any respite. It sounds almost exhausting, but because of the large variety of both characters and locations, it never gets stale. Almost all the Avengers gets their moment to shine, and all add to the plot in an organic and interesting manner, though team Captain America seemed to draw the short stick because they were easily the least impactful group. There are some really cool new combinations of superheroes (like Thor and Rocket, and Starlord and Iron Man) that actually feel earned after 10 years of build up. It reminded me a lot of Game of Thrones, that after scattering the main characters they're finally all being brought back together in interesting combinations that you did not think you needed but now can't imagine not existing.  Thanos is a suprisingly great villain, both menacing and in a strange way likeable and understandable. Despite his appearance, he's a lot more than generic bad guy that just wants to destroy the world for no particular reason #6. It takes a bad film like DC's Justice League to realize that such organic and cool superhero meetups combined with a good villain is really not all that easy to achieve.  The actions sequences are mostly great, because of the aforementioned variety in characters and locations. I love how every superhero has their own unique fighting style and it really shows on screen. You never feel like 'who exactly was that?'. Every character is distinguishable from the others and work together in a grealy entertaining way. You just got to love Spider-Man making use of Doctor Strange's magic portals to give a quick example of a great team-up.  The boldness comes largely at the end, with some really daring choices made by the writers. The biggest being that the villain actually wins at the end, in this weird The Leftovers meets Inferno (the book) kinda ending. Of course you know that there's going to be a reset of sorts and that most of the characters who died will come back, but at least in this movie, the unstoppable villain actually proved to be unstoppable for a change. That's very refreshing and resulted in some rather emotional scenes towards the end.  Of course there are still some flaws in the film. Despite the film's ballsy ending, the real death count is surprisingly tame and filled with relatively minor characters. Loki is the biggest one, but he kinda had it coming after several fakeouts. I really thought one of the original Avengers would kick the bucket, and was pervertedly unsatisfied when it didn't happen, again similar to Game of Thrones and the lack of major deaths in the latter seasons. Particularly Iron Man and Thor's potential death scenes were set up to a lack of payoff. The scene between Vision and Scarlett Witch would have meant more if we cared more about these characters. As it is, we've barely seen them throughout the years and a few early romantic scenes between them didn't really add all that much to it. This is where the lack of own films for these characters really is evident the most. The parallel scenes between Thanos and Gamora were a lot more effective because we've seen a lot more of particularly Gamora, although I still think it would have helped if we had a bit more of that interaction in previous movies. And as much as I loved the ending for having the bad guy be victorious, it really is diminished quite a bit by the knowledge that there will be a reset of sorts and the deaths aren't real deaths. It's once again really similar to Game of Thrones and the main character that died but we all knew would be back the next season. I'll admit it's a bit of a catch-22 though. If instead they would have killed off some more minor characters that might believably stay dead, you'd be left with the idea that conveniently it's only minor characters that perished, whereas the point of Thanos' plan is that anyone can be killed off regardless of importance. Still, because of it being the likes of Black Panther, Doctor Strange and Spider-man of whom we know there are sequels in the making, it does diminish the impact of these moments, though I still found them quite emotional.  Despite these flaws, I was highly entertained and captivated by almost all that transpired on screen. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the better superhero movies out there. It has so many great (action) moments and a surprisingly bold narrative for a superhero movie. I can't wait to see where they are going next, as long as they find a way to not make the events of this movie seem like a complete red herring and entire waste of time.", "WOW. Is the one word I can possibly describe such a huge, remarkable movie. This is the beginning of the end of one phase to such an expended universe, and this movie makes it app worth it. If you have not seen this move, HURRY AND GET YOUR TICKETS! IT'S WELL WORTH THE PAY. From beginning to end there is just the right amount of humor mixed with emotions and gut wrenching moments that it was hard for me to sit still in my seats. Dare I say, Josh Brolin plays one hell of a villain (Thanos.) I promise you will feel this characters presence throughout the entire movie. Be glad to know Thanos has earned the spot in the top villains of the MCU which make sense since we've known he existed since 2012's The Avengers. It's all been building up to this moment and I can assure you, this movie is such a thrill that I myself plan to make another viewing soon!", "So, I'm being extremely critical of this movie in my review, and it's worth noting before reading this that as a film major in college, my perspective of movies has changed dramatically over the last several months. If this movie had come out a year ago, this review would most definitely be a 10 star. That being said, let's get into it. Pros:\nThe character interactions were phenomenal. I loved the banter and the jokes, and the serious conversations were enjoyable as well. The action scenes were amazing, and I'm so glad that I went and saw it in theater for these alone. I absolutely loved several moments of the film, especially the dynamic between Tony Stark and Peter Parker. The Guardians of the Galaxy brought a more lighthearted tone to the film, but the plot still managed to keep rolling. The villain was multidimensional, something you don't see in a lot of Marvel films, so kudos to the Russos for that. Red Skull made a reappearance (it wasn't Hugo Weaving, so that was tough to stomach) and I was pretty satisfied with the role that he played in the film.  Cons:\nIt was one giant action scene. I don't like that in a film. There were moments of character interaction interspersed within the action scenes, but in my opinion, they were few and far between. The entire movie just felt like the third act of your standard action film; just fight scene after fight scene. The dialogue was lacking, and while I said earlier that the interactions were phenomenal and that I enjoyed the banter, the main problem here is that there wasn't enough of it. Hardly anyone had more than a few lines of dialogue that wasn't shouts during a fight scene. There was very little character development. I think only a handful of characters actually changed over the film, and not for the better necessarily. And most of the ones who did develop ended up dying at the end anyways, so it ended up not mattering, which was really difficult for me to stomach. Gamora's death could have been handled so much better, but I didn't feel anything but hatred for Thanos. I didn't feel like there was a good story, and before you jump down my throat, hear me out. Plot and story are two different things. Plot is the backbone of the conflict, and story is completely dependent on character reactions to that plot. Since there was so little character development, the story suffered astronomically. I could give you a plot breakdown in two minutes flat, but I couldn't tell you the story for the life of me because the characters changed so little. The little bit of development I saw was in Dr. Strange, Spider-Man, and Iron Man. There was also some in Thor due to the events at the beginning of the film (which we didn't see). There were tons of plot holes. Like last time we saw Steve, he was in Wakanda, and now he's a vigilante saving Vision and Wanda. Tony has a new nanite suit, for no other reason than we could have cool special effects with it. Hulk won't show for whatever reason. How did Thor survive the Power stone destroying the Asgardian Ark? Dr. Strange has a sudden change of heart over the Time stone, and while I understood that he say 14 million possible outcomes of that fight, he had to have understood that with the Time stone, Thanos would have just killed them all anyways. Final Thoughts\nI enjoyed this movie; I really did. I know it seems like I'm ripping it apart, but this movie was a bit of a let-down for me, especially since Marvel has had a pretty good run of movies these past two years. I know that this is the culmination of everything that's happened the past ten years, and that most characters have already developed, and the story (or lack thereof) will likely come in Avengers 4 next year. I love the action sequences. But I was disappointed in this movie. I was expecting so much more, and I barely got what I expected. Tl;DR\nThis movie was good. I won't argue that. I enjoyed it. But it could have been so, so much better than it is. Definitely worth the hype. I would go see it again even. But it could have been so much more if they chilled with the action for like ten minutes and tried to tell a story rather than wowing people with the special effects.", "Avengers: Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo( who gave us the terrific Civil War and The Winter Soldier), is what we can term as a satisfying summer spectacle. This is not a film. It's an event. In a film with more than 20 superheroes, not once does one feel that any one of them are underutilized. \nThe plot, as you all know , is about the conquest by Thanos (who is a computer generated character and given a terrific performance by Josh Brolin), to conquer all the 6 infinity stones and to wipe out half the universe. It's all up to the Avengers along with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop his evil plans. \nThat's all I can tell u about the plot. Because revealing too much will kill the experience. The director(s) have packed in all they can - marvelous action set pieces, humour, twists and dramatic moments etc....\nAlmost all the department have done their jobs neatly. Be it the stunning VFX or the exhilarating background score , the film has it all.\nThe climax, I would like to mention, is not at all what you would expect, especially since this is a Marvel movie. Also the character deaths too will come across as a shock. \nNow coming to the performances, the list is going to be too long if I mention each and every actor. Everyone has done their roles perfectly and not once do you feel that a single character is given prominence. Hats off for the director(s) for undertaking a project of this magnificence. \nSo all in all this an experience or should I say THIS IS the Marvel movie we all waited for. So go in and have a Blast.\nMy rating- 4.5/5\nNote: Do not miss the END CREDITS...", "This movie is incredibly entertaining. The comedy, the costumes, the CGI, the music... all of it is extremely well done.The acting is incredible, and it's great to see the characters we've loved for a decade all come together in an epic war for the future of the universe. That being said, this is a bad script disguised by great production. There are plot holes everywhere, the ending is unsatisfying, and there is no character development. Thanos is incredibly well done and the backstory is compelling; in contrast, the heroes Marvel has spent so many movies developing and making real and complete fall flat because they have no real development. There is no theme. It is true that the people who are saying there is no plot are wrong- there is a plot, there just isn't any emotional substance behind it. It is action without a compelling story for our heroes. Hopefully, all of this will be fixed and explained in the next installment, but for now, this movie is entertaining without anything more to it.", "I really don't want to give a grade on this movie till I see how the second part of this story unfolds. They gave a good back story on Thanos. I didn't like how Thor immediately became more powerful w his new axe, when in Ragnorok it showed he didn't need the hammer to be God if Thunder. To me it feels like this movie's goal was to set us up for Captain Marvel than how they defeat Thanos. I gave it a seven for now, but will change it on how the story in second part plays out.", "I feel iw was way too predictable, I kinda feel like I knew what was going to happen straight away. There were no real defining moments for me where I was on the edge of my seat or where I was shocked.", "A movie that will make you owe. Quick climax to action moments where you truly feel as overwhelmed as the events going on. Overall satisfying, pushes you to ask what is next as answers are far from being unveiled.\nA notable comment is to point out how this movie tries largely to patch up Taika Watiti's mess in Thor: Ragnarok with regards to Thor's losses. Would have rathered not hearing the nonsense of Ragnarok to start with, especially if it ultimately comes undone. Anyway, one thing is certain, in Avengers 4, the Avengers must go back to their phase 1 roots and....Assemble.", "Spoiler Free Review!\nWhat an amazing and epic adventure! My only regret is not seeing it in IMAX. (I probably will) Contrary to my expectations, no characters were over done and none were wasted. A great balance of the most beloved and the \"new to the show\". This film was nothing like the \"super boring and confusing\" Age of Ultron, or the \"funny but forgettable\" Guardians 2, or the \"not as great the second time around\" Thor Ragnarok. Despite its epic scale (lots of locations and lots of characters) and loose ends it had to tie up, Infinity War was surprisingly easy to follow, and totally engaging all the way through. Fun, hilarious, emotional, action packed (with lots of real stunts and not cartoony CGI), great soundtrack and totally worth seeing more than once. The directors (the Russo brothers) may have finally dethroned \"The Avengers\" as my favorite MCU movie. Civil War is a close second, also directed by the Russo brothers. Those guys were a great addition to the MCU. Fantastic film, I can't wait to watch it again and no one spoil it for anyone!", "Funnier, more thrilling, more action, more devastating. It might go down as the best MCU movie.", "I really love the movie, the gathering was not as complete as I expected, but the action sequences were great. Some characters missings, but at the end a great movie. \nI hope that Marvel doesn't wait ti much fir the secind part, 'cuz many fans will waiting for a retribution after this end.", "I've been a big fan of the mcu for many years. But after the second avengers movie I was kind of worried that infinity was going to be bad. But none the less it blew me out of the water.  It had fantastic suprises amazing build up and an ending that was complete but still left you on a cliffhanger. Thanos was an amazing villain with believable motives. The only problem I had with him is I feel like we didn't see him much. Some of the heroes weren't really developed in the movie at all but the Russo brothers did a great job non the less. I was debating whether to give this a 8 or a 9 but I chose a 9 because it felt like it deserved a high score. The only real flaw was some character development and some scenes that were too bloated but it was a given taken how big the movie was. But I went a 9 mainly because it's a film that had a large weight on its shoulders that still managed to blow all expectations.", "How is that movie i am not expect what will happen, the avengers will win or lose in all movie they won at the end but that movie is completely different. Best movie, Best GFX, Best Acting, I was crying in that movie.", "This is a good Movie to begin with! But did it meet the expectations? To me personally, not at all. The aftermath of this movie just doesn't feel high at stakes because we already know some of the characters who died, are gonna have sequels in the future. They should've kept them alive and kill off others who were gonna feel like they were really in jeopardy of returning. And this is clearly a Part I of II. So to me it just feels like Marvel switched up the promotional campaign to make people not wait until both parts are released and intentionally have them watch it at the movie theater. Something just felt off about the movie. From the character introductions (except captain America, which gave me goosebumps) up to the story line. This left a lot of questions and it had a lot of plotholes honestly. The humor to me was average and it didn't have clever dialogue like some of the past marvel movies. So yeah.. kind of dissapointing to me. Still better than the average movie just cause it's still fun to see all these actors in action. Might watch it on Blu-ray again after the release, but no second watch for me at the movies.", "Best movie ever marvel simply do not disappointed they continuously give the fans what they deserve and want to good to be true can't wait to see the next part of this amazing movie", "I am still processing this movie and hour and a half later. Please see it in a full theatre. The reactions from everyone were amazing and what a ride. One reviewer title his review \"I need a Therapist\" and I agree completely. No beginning credits and straight to where Ragnarok left off for the emotional ride of a lifetime. I have been waiting over 40 years for this movie and somehow Kevin and the Russo brothers did it. Thank you Marvel!", "I was so excited and happy to finally see this movie and I left with wanting me. All of the MCU characters I expected appeared in this movie. The story carried with much humor and action you would expect from a Marvel movie. I give it 2 thumbs up!", "This movie was fantastic! By far my favorite Marvel movie! Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor we're all bada**... so was Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Had it's serious moments and great fight scenes, definitely had its fair share of jokes and wise cracks! Absolutely loved this movie! WAKANDA FOREVER! Definitely kind of a Thanos Origin story.. and just so you know there IS a post credit scene, people in my theater heard there wasn't one and they left but I'm a true marvel fan so obviously I held in my urine and sat through that long list of credits and I'm glad I did!", "This movie left me and other viewers speechless. While it does have a negan style ending, it does so with grace", "Very very spectacular film. It's one of the best films that I have seen", "If you have enjoyed the long road leading from Iron Man to now, the pay off is real. Outstanding. The Russo Brothers have proven they are the masters at telling these stories. I can't wait til Avengers 4 and the final chapter of the Thanos saga.", "Wow, this movie was an incredible ride! It jumps straight into the action. I loved the feeling of no characters being safe. I was legitimately worried about some of the characters lives when fighting Thanos! Thanos was the best villain we have seen so far in the MCU. The story connected together nicely! The red skull cameo was shocking and refreshing! Just all in all an amazing movie and leaves me dying to see the next one!", "SO for so many characters to be assembled in a movie, I thought it was well done without feeling too over packed. The plot developed at an appropriate pace and there was still character development.\nI was a bit dissapointed that The Gaurdians of the Galaxy so readily split apart(it just doesn't go with the family message of their last film).\nI was extremely dissapointed that Marvel has eliminated Captain America. Never was his super hero name mentioned in the film. No more red, white and blue; he now wears black. No more stars on the chest or shield. He now introduces himself as \"Steve Rogers\". And every reference is to \"Cap\" or \"Captain\" at best. Shame to see the iconic hero being changed for the sake of international ticket sales.", "Despite the potential for simply a Mr Peanut Butter Crossover Episode, the Russo brothers managed to balance all of the characters. Keeping the focus on a few main threads yet making every appearance matter was no mean feat. Whilst some of the emotional impact relies on your investment in the characters, I'm okay with this. Having spent up to the last 10 years with some of these characters I'm happy enough to walk into the screening with this pre-investment. A fantastically enjoyable experience.", "My biggest fear was that they would do the movie a bit like they made Thor Ragnar\u00f6k with a funny tone and oneliners (loved Thor btw) but they nailed it.", "I really enjoyed watching it. The movies is really recommended for everyone!", "I went in to go see this movie with butterflies in my stomach... And I gotta say it did not disappoint. The plot was on point. The characters amazing as always. And oh the big bad Titan Thanos, Lord know I wouldn't wanna mess with him Jeez. It was awesome seeing him and his goons in action on the big screen. This has gotta be by far the best movie in the MCU. Of course it's 10years leading to this why wouldn't it be!!", "I did not grow up reading comics but I have certainly enjoyed a lot of what Marvel has developed over the past 10 years. Some misses, in my opinion, but no one does superhero movies/television better than Marvel. All of that to say, Infinity War is near perfect and is the best Marvel Studios production, thus far. It is incredible and should be a contender for Best Picture and Best Director(s) the next awards ceremony cycle. I cannot wait to see this again!", "A must see spoiler free. It's a remarkable achievement that so many characters are given something to do and with enough direction and \"film\" to make us care about it. The Russo brothers top their Civil War efforts, barely, but do indeed manage to bring us a clear story arc that doesn't waste time on unnecessary issues. I will rank this below their efforts in Winter Soldier, again barely. There was more espionage intrigue in that movie that was more satisfying to this viewer. But, in the current culture where superhero movie fatigue is a very real concern, and hype regarding superhero movies tends toward inflation of its true merit for entertainment, this monument should stand as a tight culmination of just about EVERY point raised and debated from the first Thor to last year's Thor. Which I find fitting and I'll refrain from saying more. Grade: A-\nRecommend", "10 years,18 movies and 72 characters all lead up to this one movie.It was all leading up to this after 10 years in the making thanks to Kevin Feige well-oiled marvel universe, And I'm gladly here to tell you that Avenger infinity war is a really good film except for some of the minor problems which are some of the characters were not put in the spotlight but I see why they could not do this because they just had 2 hours 40mins and tremendous amount of characters but you don't realise this until you are trying to find yourself after the ending of this movie, the ending is one of the most breath taking movie events in history. Thanos is well present as a mad Titan as he is one of most powerful marvel movie villain till this date and is the only villain that breaks Marvels bad villain curse because you can see during the movie what chaos he can actually bring to the universe.All the characters are given as much of screen time they can get but truly own each scene they are in, unfortunately, All of the characters split up into teams for the majority this film but the meet up at one point or another. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, please bring a box of tissues to Avengers Infinity War because this is truly a culmination of the 19 films that came before.", "This ilm was just...... Simply put its amazing clearly a must watch !", "Has none stop action start to finish, brilliant story, brilliant CGI, everything", "I will start by saying that I came in with absolutely NO expectations. I stayed away from any speculations, reviews, and/or trailers. That being said the film, for the most part, was pretty satisfying. There are rarely any dull moments, a lot of very good laughs, awesome action, and a great villain that isn't brain-dead and simply power-hungry. I actually give it a 7.5/10 but rounded up instead because I tend to be rather nitpicky.  To start with some of the pros:\n Now to get to some of the gripes I have that made the movie a bit \"off\" and less enjoyable:\n For the most part it was a good movie and I'm excited to see what they will do in the next episode.", "The movie is great and Marvel keeps kicking out fun shows. However, the logic of this scenario doesn't track. If these infinity stones are so powerful and bad, and if gathered together by Thanos they pose a threat to half the universe, then why weren't they gathered up, taken to the super-massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, launched into the gravity well and destroyed? No matter how powerful the blow-back from the stones, compared to a black hole that swallows star systems, planets, and other black holes for a snack everyday, they would be nothing. Once beyond the event horizon, NOTHING, not even Thanos could get them back.", "It was a very emotional action packed movie that had all your favorite characters in one big amazing movie. RECOMMEND", "I always loved marvel movies but now iam living it, this was the best movie ever", "Why would I choose a review title like that? Because the movie brought so much emotions out of me that no movie has ever even remotely managed to do. Thanos has become my favorite villain of all time. Will watch it again.", "I've always been saying that this generation, whilest the Star Wars franchise is still going strong, the Marvel Cinematic is this generation's Star Wars. And Infinity Wars is one of it's finest work. Everything from the beginning all the way to the end, just resonates with action and drama throughout. I have watched this twice and I barely even noticed the two hours pass by up to the final scene. Marvel have truly made you invest in the characters to the point where you are happy or sad for what happens to each of them. And much like the Empire Strikes Back, it makes you want to see it again and come back for more when all is said and done.", "This movie was funny, exciting, epic, and emotional. Marvel rewards the fans who have been watching every marvel movie for the past decade with an epic superhero movie that will never be duplicated. By far the best aspect of this film is the interactions between the characters, which were brilliantly written and well acted. Is this movie perfect? No. Of course this movie has some trouble combining all the characters together while attempting to move the plot forward, but everything comes together perfectly with the most emotional and gut wrenching ending to any superhero movie I've every seen.", "One of the best marvel films yet CANNOT WAIT FOR NEXT YEAR!!!!!", "Avengers: Infinity War is the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. The film follows Thanos on his quest for all six of the infinity stones in efforts to wipe out half of the universe. As he tries to complete his quest, the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy band together to stop him from completing this quest.  Like most films do, Avengers: Infinity War establishes what kind of film it will be right in the first scene. The film establishes the emotion, action, humor, and the intense villain. As the film progresses none of this ever lets up and we get the most exhilarating Marvel experience to date.  The Russo brothers orchestrate this film masterfully. They were able to juggle all the characters in one film, in ways that are certainly welcomed and unexpected. They did this by taking certain heroes and grouping them off with other heroes as they try to achieve different goals throughout the course of the film. While the Russo brothers manage to juggle all these characters, they also manage to bring out the best aspects of these heroes and their previous films. This strikes a perfect balance in the film of emotional, humorous, and action-packed moments. As the film shifts focus to each group of heroes, these moments compliment each other, making for the smoothest pacing we have seen in a Marvel film. This is due to the Russo brothers bringing along other directors from previous MCU films to executively produce the film. However, the perfect balance does not stop at the heroes, as we get a great story for Thanos as well.  Not only is Thanos the most intense MCU villain, but he is the best MCU villain to date. Josh Brolin gives an excellent performance that establishes his character as an intimidating one, where the stakes feel like they are actually against our favorite heroes. Brolin's character is also the best-written villain in the MCU. As our favorite heroes try to achieve their goals, Thanos sets out and tries to achieve his own. Thanos gets the most screen time out of any villain in the MCU and his story give us insight and depth into his character. Thanos isn't trying to destroy half of humanity for the sake of destroying half of humanity. His well-written character arc shows us that he has emotion and a reason for his madness. This is the first MCU film where the story feels like it is equally told through the lens of the heroes and the villain, making for the greatest Marvel villain to date.  I can't say much without spoiling the film, but the Russo brothers manage to find a perfect balance in all of our favorite heroes while giving us the best Marvel villain to date. This makes the culmination of ten years in the MCU feel well worth the wait. This is not only the best Marvel experience I have had but one of the best cinematic experiences I have ever had. Don't miss what could certainly be the film event of the summer and possibly the year. My score: 9.75/10", "Seriously?! I waited that long for THIS?! Absolutely the worst avengers movie ever! Marvel just screwed themselves with this one.. there's no coming back from this crap!", "Start to finish just excellent. One of the best movies ever made!!", "Infinity War. There are many things to say about the film, but for the most part, I liked it. I liked several of the character interactions, some that were actually genuinely surprising. Thanos himself was also a great villain to add onto the current line up of MCU villains. There were some genuinely funny moments in the film, but the ending will leave a massive impact on you. To explain it, let's just say that when my Dad and I left the showing of the movie, practically no one exiting from the showing of the movie discussed it. It is genuinely an emotional roller coaster, with how the ending credits seem to paint the illusion to an obituary, or even a list of casualties. I knew what the end result was going to be because of the source material, but I wasn't prepared. A child sitting behind us was actually crying at the ending of the film as well.  If there's one thing that I didn't like about the film was actually how it was laid out. You have the overarching threat of Thanos trying to get the final Infinity Stones, but you also have a side plot with Thor meeting the Guardians of the Galaxy and then going on a mission with Groot and Rocket among others. It did make following the movie slightly difficult and convoluted. In addition to that, there were probably too many humorous moments. While some moments are genuinely funny, there are others that nearly destroy the more serious atmosphere that the film is trying to establish. While I understand the reason behind the need for it, it does come off as a double-edged sword.  Despite that, it was an enjoyable movie.", "This is going to be rather brief because it's difficult to discuss the film without spoiling anything. That said, oftentimes there's a pivotal moment or a reveal that drives a film's viewership based solely on hype and fervor. In such films, once the initial shock dissipates, there's little left to warrant rewatching, but it does encourage patrons to flood the box officer earlier than later. I suspect the studio push admonishing early moviegoers to avoid spoilers and inciting the hashtag movement, \"thanosdemandsyoursilence\", was likely a calculated tool to drive the hype. Infinity War, while having such pivotal moments, will probably stand as one of the better Marvel Studios films regardless of the hype.  The ensemble has matured together, and the on-screen chemistry is palpable. It's a blockbuster film that lends well to being seen in large-format or IMAX screenings. The sound mix is also one of the better mixes from Marvel Studios in that despite heavy use of low frequency effects and steady starship droning, the dialogue was crisp and clear. A friend of mine commented that the sound was fuller than other Marvel films and in many ways felt more like a Star Wars mix. I can't disagree with that. While there are jarring explosions and shrill screaming of streaking shrapnel and debris, the soundtrack was balanced with low rumbling, almost brooding, undercurrents. Of course all of this was highlighted and even carried by Alan Silvestri's score. There were a few minor editing missteps, but I feel they were done in the interest of time and pacing. Despite this, I didn't notice continuity problems. Given the various converging story lines in addition to the myriad of Hollywood headliners who all need their respective screen time, the Russo brothers held this together quite well. In the wrong hands this easily could have become a theatrical Batman v Superman mess. If you've read the 1990's Infinity Gauntlet comic story arc, you already have a good idea as to what's going to happen. Even so, I encourage you to keep this information to yourself in order to avoid ruining it for those that did not read the comics. There is an element of elitism among some comic readers in that some of them disparage those whose only knowledge base of these characters is solely gleaned from the films. I can also tell you, as a comic reader, you don't know everything that happens or even how it transpires. The film adaptation in many ways is only loosely based on the comic. However, I am happy that they stayed true to the complex nature of The Mad Titan. Thanos was always a multifaceted villain. The challenges of green-screen and motion-capture acting didn't interfere with the stellar performance of Josh Brolin. Truly mad, but never unhinged, Thanos quite literally steals most scenes. The performance was captivating as Brolin effortlessly vacillates between brutal cruel tyrant, pitiful broken father, and calculated and devious manipulator. Thanos is a character Marvel Studios absolutely could not alter, and I'm pleased to say, this favored character was done justice. In the coming weeks it will become increasingly difficult to avoid spoilers, so if you have any interest in the Marvel films, I encourage you to see this soon. If, by chance, some elements are revealed to you prior to your making it to the theater, don't be discouraged. If you're an Avengers fan, you will still enjoy this one. If you're a Thanos fan, you must see this.", "I just had the greatest chance of watching the amazing movie and man i was on the edge of my seat for the whole duration. I screamed at the entries of superheroes (More often when Ironman's and Thor's entries ) and i went emotional at the ending when we lost nearly half of the heroes. For the reasons known only to makers, only the original members of The Avengers were left alive (considering Hawkeye didn't turn to ash like others). I think they have setup pretty solid storyline for next Avengers movie (and probably the last).Till then we have all year to cook up our know theories.", "I knew this movie was going to be good going into it but I never could've imagined that this was going to be the outcome. I'm rather partial to Marvel movies and genuinely enjoy most of them but I think that this insane, wild and amazing crossover was the best of all of them. It was hilariously funny and tragically sad. I loved every minute of it.", "I was never a fan of comic book movies and I am still somewhat skepitcal when it comes to these type of movies because generally they mostly rely on CGI effects with only action included in them. But after seeing Avengers : Infinity War and think of all the comic book movies that have been made by Marvel I may be wrong. For people who have never seen the previous Marvel movies, they can still watch this movie because they can understand the gist of the story even though they may not know well the characters involved. When seeing Infinity War there is so much to savor. The story is simple : a group of remarakable people with both superpowers or fighting capabilities have to face an evil villain called Thanos who wants to control the universe by securing infinity stones. What makes this movie so great is how all these characters manage to blend together with both humor and drama involved. Even Thanos as a villain, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin, adds real depth to his character. The action sequences are great complemented by very good CGI effects. Even though the movie is long, it never seems boring at any time because there is always something happening and with all the action and drama involved it never feels dull.  Yes, the story is not yet concluded for this movie but it will leave the viewer wanting for more to know what will happen next. I am eagerly awaiting the next Avengers movie to see how this epic chapter will end.", "I don't review much but after watching Avengers : Infinity War thought to write something. So many avengers i feel could not justify every one of them. Movie is decent but they have done cheap trick and incomplete ending.\nNot impressed.", "This movie, if you're like me, has been a long time coming. And the wait does pay off, while I'm somewhat satisfied by this movie, I cannot judge it because it feels incomplete, it's only the first part of this major story and I'm wanting more so cheers to that!! My main problem is I feel as if maybe marvel is taking it in a direction to where captain marvel saves the day (don't get me wrong she's a badass hero) and I'm left asking if she does end up being the one to \"stop\" thanos, \"where the hell have you been this entire time?!?\". \nOverall it's a good movie, definitely better than Age of Ultron. Just wish there was more dialogue with some of the teams, and more explaination with the Red Skull and Vormir, kind of seemed a little out of nowhere....\nOne more year", "MCU introduced this movie as the dream project and YES!! this movie is bent on target. BINGO..!! If you have been a Marvel student since IRONMAN until Black Panther you are gonna love this movie. It is really remarkable how the Avengers and their Space allies are brought together as one team against THANOS. \nThe script looks a bit loose but the dialogues will thrill you for sure. The screenplay, background score and the visual effects are fascinating.\nRegarding the characters, you are going to love the appearance of your favorite superhero but THOR and CAPTAIN AMERICA steals all the charisma, specially the intro scenes of Captain America. Chris Evans looks are eye-catching and he is looking stunning. Thor again emerges as the most powerful Avenger. Tony Starks aka Ironman aka Robert Downey Jr. has been cool as ever with his new suit and Dr. Strange, Gamora, Vision, Starlord, Black Widow,SPIDERMAN, Wanda Maxinoff and so many others looks justifying with their roles.\nI will recommend viewers to visit the cinemas near you, watch the movie and enjoy the funride. But... but.. hold your nerves a bit tight as we are gonna loose some heros.. The heros you might love and admire..... Thank You!!", "The hype is real. The fight scene is this movie is epic!!!", "10/10 movie,\nThis movie is filled with action, amazing CGI, plot twist, and amazing acting. The entire time I was watching it I was on the edge of my seat. I recommend seeing this movie to anyone who is ready for a cinematic experience of a lifetime.", "From funny to sad . Plenty of Actions incredible !!!", "As always thor is rocking on movie, movie is awesome.\nstill waiting for next part of the movie.", "For years, people have demanded a superhero flick where the good guys don't always get there way, something that goes against the norm. And this did, it really did. This is amazing in almost every single way, I didn't like how they kept switching from groups to groups because personally I was just becoming immersed and boom, it changes to another group. This film is everything I expected it to be if not more. The trailers made me feel underwhelmed, esp when we got our first proper look at the CGI Thanos, that's going to be used in this fil. Speaking of Thanos, he may be the best villan that the MCU has to offer for very good reason, he's not just your typical, oh I want to rule the world, he actually believes what he's doing is right and goes incredibly far to prove it. I highly recommend this film for anyone, try to watch the other MCU movies and go in spoiler free, for this film to be truly impacting. 9.8/10, would watch again :)", "Boy oh boy, what great fun this film is. To think it all began ten years ago with Iron Man, and to now witness the scale and ambition is truly something special. It felt historic. Credit where credit is due, director, Anthony and Joe Russo blend all these characters in so well and seeing how they interact is as hilarious and special as always. Having spent time with them for so long now, we find ourselves attached and that's why it works and we root for them. I'd argue Thanos is the MCU's best villain yet, a character whose god complex and interesting ideology separates him from traditional notions of the villains in the MCU. Oh, and there's also the fact that he can actually compete with the heroes, with many of them feeling inferior to Thanos and his army. There is more depth to him that I first imaged, and the CGI and performance by Brolin is great. It's a treat to see the whole audience laughing, clapping, gasping-something not all films do these days. It's a testament to the creative team behind this universe, (Kevin Feige etc.) because they have simply been so consistently ambitious. If there is one thing, the humour in the film did surprise me, and with that said it does take away from the emotional scenes. It is a Marvel film however, and to think that its staple blend of humour and action wouldn't be as prominent is perhaps an oversight. When you actually think what this film has done, combing the ten years worth of stories, and putting together characters who haven't yet met, all in the space of two and a half hours, it is an achievement worth celebrating and enjoying.", "Infinity War is one of the most unpredictable movies of the marvel cinematic universe (even when it has some predictable things) The movie is entertaining and funny, is an 149 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. The performances of all the actors is really good, but I had to highlight the performance of Josh Brolin as the villain, Thanos. The character is terrifying and you can feel that something could go terrible wrong when he\u00b4s on screen, he is the character that, to me, is the most interesting in the movie, and thetas really good, because a movie like this without a great villain could not be a good movie, and Brolin brings something additional to the character with his performance, even when the character is made by CGI, the performance is still very powerful, is like Andy Serkis as Caesar in the new Planet of the Apes movies. The visual effects are, of course amazing and makes what the best visual effects do, make you believe that what is on screen is real. Now, I have to speak about the negative points of the movie. First, it is a lot, the story tat they\u00b4re telling here could have been not a bit of a mess (like it is the movie) if they were telling it as a 10 episode series or something like that, but a movie can\u00b4t do that, so the result that we have on screen is a lot, and sometimes you can forget what some characters were doing at the beginning of the movie because they appear in minute 10 and the appear again on minute 40. Of course, everything that\u00b4s going on is important, but that problem makes you feel a little disconnected with some characters. Speaking about the characters, there were some that were really useless in the movie, and they were only there because they were introduced before. Stay for the scene after the credits, it is amazing, not like the one in Spiderman homecoming. In the end, infinity war will please fans and it will make them even more anxious for the next avengers movie. Watch out at the end, maybe you'll cry.", "This is one of the best movies of all times, wow CGI, funny, unpredictable story yet believeable. it's like i remember the first time when i watched Avengers 1 but even more better.  bravo to Russo brother, it did live up to the hype.", "\"Amazing\",\"best MCU film ever\",\"so good\". These are just some quotes from people who saw this summer blockbuster before me. Don't get me wrong, it was amazing and a visual spectacle at that, but was it just me or was it just too much?\nFirstly, it's a film you need super human bladder control for, as the mammoth 150 minute feature is so quick paced you will be lost even if you miss even 5 seconds of it, tirelessly trying to keep up with the characters whereabouts. As Thanos causes destruction everywhere he steps foot, it brings all of our favourite heroes together. Special mention to Thanos by the way, easily one of my favourite characters. His primal need for the stones is engrossing and you almost want him to succeed in retracting all of them just to see what madness will happen next. Visually it does live up to the hype, I saw the film in 2D and sort of regret that decision as I was completely blown away.\nAs for the story line I loved it. However, the sheer amount of avengers/guardians of the galaxy stars crammed in, it felt that there was never enough time to get involved with anyone's story before I was thrown into someone else's.\nThis installment did not mess about with instant anquish for characters and fans from minute one and showed no signs of slowing down.\nOne word I would use to describe this film would be futuristic and that's probably my only grumble. Maybe I'm old fashioned and enjoyed the days when Tony Stark's suit was tinkered away in his man cave and didn't do things only green lantern could. Or even spider man when he didn't have huge mechanical spider legs coming from his back. Or what about the hulk was feared by all and could not be stopped once he was in full smash mode? But maybe I just need to get with the times, as all of them days are far behind us.\nAll in all it was a glorious mess and it somehow worked. Pulling at my Marvel heart strings towards the end, when Thanos makes his final blow set up perfectly for the second rollercoaster ride that is Infinity War. \nWith plenty of shocking twists and turns this film gave us a much darker setting but still snuck in the laughs we all crave from Marvel.\nMaybe I just need time to let this brave new way of seeing our comic book starlets do their thing settle. I will probably go and see this film again and I am in no way shape or form giving up on MCU. Once the second installment is all said and done, I may regret any criticism I have given; I hope that is the case.\nFrom where I'm sitting at the moment it looks like there is no way out for our dissipated heroes, so lets hope our post credit cry for help can save the day. Bring on Infinity War 2!", "No words can describe it. I've been waiting for this movie for ages. And it's finally here. I have never been so nervous to see a movie in my life. I was asking questions like \" Is it going to be really bad?\" Was my expectations to high? But of course, Marvel has created another masterpiece. First off, let's talk about Josh Brolin as Thanos. He was incredible. Every look, gesture and movement was amazingly realistic due to the outstanding CGI, but Brolin did an amazing job to making the character feel sympathetic. The best Superhero villain in a superhero movie to date. Next, the visuals. The visuals were outstanding. Gorgeous to look at. Joe and Anthony Russo must have really worked their asses of to achieve. Also we can't forget their directing. They really did kick it out of the park. And last but not least, the action and characters. Of course this movie had to have incredible action to showcase the pure brutality of Thanos and why he wants the infinity stones. As well as that the rest of the cast were amazing as usual. Robert was his usual acting just a tint better and another one of my favourites was Chris as Thor throughout the movie. We can't forget about Cap either. And that ending! For the ending alone I would recommend seeing it. It's worth the hype and a thousand times over. Avengers 4, here we come!", "This movie is great, without question worth seeing on the big screen.\nYou will have to see the other MCU movies, but for this movie, it feels like a reward. And that what i like about this movie, it knows that you have seen how these heroes was born/made, so it jumps straight into action and keeps going in a good pace. I was afraid this was gonna be Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1, you know? Only build up, build up, and more build up. but no! This could be a movie for itself. \nAnd man, am i glad this is a 2 part. This need more then just 2 and a half hours. I want to say more, but this is a movie you will enjoy more going in cold.\nOkay i will say some fun bits, so LODS OF *Frank*-ING SPOLIERS!!! Like... MANY SPOLIERS!!!\n.....\n....\n...\n..\n.\nOkay. Man i love that the dwarf Pirate Thor seeks out, is Peter Dinklage, and he's the biggest dwarf there is. XD", "The movie was great!  The 10 year build up of Marvel Tension has paid off. The comedy at some parts were hilarious and not over done. A killer beginning that jump started the movie. The Structure of the movie was great, and the entire movie is kinda split into several parts and may take some effort to keep track of. We see the journey of creating Thor's new axe hammer , the black order trying to get the other stones, the prevention of Thanos getting the reality stone , the battle at Titan, and of course the war at Wakanda.  However the ending does disappoint me a bit. It finishes off with no conclusion and true ending. It felt like the whole movie was incomplete and a drag down because of the climax. Thanos got all the infinity stones and the whole 2 hours and a half of the movie wasn't really necessary for that. I can understand if Marvel wants to split the conflict of the movie into Avengers 3 and 4 because it wouldn't be wise to cram the climax in 2 and 1/2 hours but it should at least give us something more than a loss of hope. Overall, me , being a marvel fan for years give it and 8 out of ten. The comedy ,structure and journey all added up but didn't reach my expectations. Having half the Avengers die just makes the 4th movie have more expectations and the movie could live up to its name. I hope Avengers 4 will be an ultimate climax and avenging end.", "Avengers: Infinity War is definitely a very dark movie with lots of superheroes dying. You will walk out of the cinema crying and you will go to sleep with your brain still recalling those little screen shots of the movie. You will NOT be walking out of your bedroom when you finish watching, this movie deserves to be watched in the theatres. \nThe theme reminds me of \"Logan\", where everyone you grew up with for over 10 years have grown old and many of them are dying off. This movie will remind you that soon, the old avengers will die of and be replaced with new superheroes you wouldn't want to watch because the connection won't be the same as the old guys.\nThis movie is recommended for people over the age of 10, younglings will not be able to understand the darkness of this movie. Recommended for people who have watched ALL of the MCU's movies like, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, GOTG, and Avengers.\nThis movie is NOT for people who did not watch all of the MCU's movies. You will not have the connection that everyone else has and you just won't understand the pain that we're going through, watching most of our favourite superheroes dying off.  Why not 10/10?\nI am just so sad that many of the superheroes are dying. Although, if asked \"what could be changed?\" I would say 'nothing\".", "Ok. Let's talk about most awaited movie. Infinity war.\nAs per my and my 8 friends opinion(who watched movie with me) this is the worst movie in Avengers franchise. What is plus point:\nGood fight scene.\nSome goose bumps moments.\nAnd you know cross-over. What is minus point:\n**Movie is half, i don't want to spoil but movie is officially half. Movie ends in the middle of the scene. You will finish this movie with real confusion like what just happened and what will happen.\n**Comedy is not good. As compared to Avengers 1 and 2 movie, comedy is just time pass. \n**There are so many superheroes in the movie, but no one fights with his potential. (I know Thanos is the most powerful villain in MCU as well as in comics.) Wanda Maximoff's fight scene is unexpectedly good. Iron man and Captain America are as expected. Rest all superheroes don't match your expectation in fighting scenes. Some are extremely miserable.\n**And the last, if you have watched trailer, atleast 20% of the scenes are missing in the movie. There is no possibility of such scenes. Conclusion:\nWatch it, but without expectation. Or wait for next Movie(May ,2019) and watch it togather.", "This movies dark, and you loose half of the people in the universe ... but you NEED to read the comic books before you complain, because that is what happens during this one, That is why Thanos is one of the biggest and most vial of villain .. this was the first time we have had a fully flushed out villain, the build up is amazing and i can't wait to see the avenger 4 and trust me if you want to finds out what happens next you can always read... this is the first movie that i have, cried, been angry, worried and laughed in the same movie, this has been 10 years of anticipation and it was worth it .. i will be watching this as much as i can and then i'm going to buy it .. hands down my favorite movie marvel or otherwise", "The movie overall was pretty good, but at times there were some plot holes and there were parts where I felt it was just too much. The beginning of the movie especially I found confusing as it started off with this heartbreaking moment that left audience members in shock and still trying to process what had happened. Then straight afterwards, it goes into a normal scene and we're already trying to make light of the situation with jokes in the movie. This, I didn't appreciate and because of it I missed about 20 minutes still trying to get over the first bit.  Some characters were stronger than they should have been and some characters weren't strong enough. At times it seems Thanos was almost beaten by the weakest characters but then at other times his strength powered right over some really strong and powerful characters. The first problem, going back to the first scene was the characterisation of Loki. Loki is a god, almost as powerful as Thor practically and he choses to use a knife to fight Thanos even though in earlier movies he is depicted as super smart? That wasn't right.\nWhen Gamora is being killed by Thanos we're expected to feel sympathy for Thanos or agree with what he is doing but for me personally I thought that was unforgiveable. Thanos is a real bad guy and a great villain obviously, but some of these moments were just kind of thrown in there without further explanation which made the story a bit wonky.\nThe ending of the movie was a cliff hanger, but it was kind of made obvious that some of those who died were not going to stay permanently dead such as Black Panther and Spider-Man who only just started their franchises to great success. Overall, the movie was nice to watch, at times it was hard to watch, but it is a good movie. It is not however, better than the first Avengers movie. But it is better than Age of Ultron.", "The greatest movie of all the sequel, can't wait to part two.", "Very good action scenes between the Avengers. Thor with the Guardians is fantastic. The collaboration between Spider Man, Iron Man and Doctor Strange is perfect. Thor with stormbreaker and rocket in fight of wakanda is unbeatable. Thanos makes a lot of sense to save the universe by killing half. Thanos is empathetic with Gamora, The only thing that he loves in the universe. I never expected Doctor Strange to give the time gem so easy but we know he sees the future and saving Tony was the only way. The end is quite good you feel that the heroes suffer. Half of life in the Universe died because of the gauntlet including heroes, The only two ways is time travel and prevent it or take the gauntlet and reverse everything. The problem is to know that the heroes will revive.", "Avengers Imfinity War is one of best and strongest Marvel films to date. I've been waiting for this for about 5 years since I heard it was being made, and I can now say I've seen it and made history. This movie is an emotional rollercoaster to get through.  First off, all of the characters are great. That's what makes these Marvel films so relatable; that's why we love these characters. They connect with us and we have such love for them. And all the characters, and even the villain, connect with us so much.  Th visuals in this film are, for the most part brilliant . Thanos looks so real, except for one scene where I could tell it was CG. Also, the whole Black Order were done very well, and looked very real.  Thanos himself as the main villain, is one of the greatest villains, if not THE greatest villain. As soon as you see him on screen, you know that there's going to be something very bad happening. Josh Brolin did such an amazing job at his portrayal, and his backstory is very well portrayed. You really do feel for this guy, and when he shows his emotion, it works very well.  The action sequences are long, but they're exhilarating and keep you on edge. Two battles happening at once, one in Wakanda and on Titan, the film cross-cuts between these two sequences and it is very nail biting. There is so much destruction and shocking moments in this film, it is hard to take in. And again, it is emotional.  The humour as well works very well in this film, jokes are on point, mostly revolving around the Guardians, when they're on screen.  However I have my flaws.  The film jumps around a lot during the first half, and I think this is due to the amount of characters they had on screen and in the film. I think they could've handled it a little better though, because it was a bit jumpy.  Also, the visuals were mostly good, except for, again a few scenes with Thano where you could tell it was CG.  I'm going to end my review there are not get into any spoilers, so overall the Russo Brothers made a fantastic film with a lot of effort put into it, that very much paid off. I'm giving Avengers Infinity War 9/10", "Theres a lot of stories happening at the same time so, dont lose any minute of this movie! Its breathtaking!", "One of the best superhero movies after dark knight", "Good movie with all around story.\nPeople in cinema who did not know this is part 1 got sad. If you are fan of genre do not miss just naje sure to use restriom first since this is almost 3 hours of sitting", "I hate superhero movie because it all have a happy ending but this movie ,\n OMG i was hocked \npple were like r u kidding me Thanos won and we lost multiple superhero.", "Was actually bored during first 75 mins. Much better last 45 mins. Much of it seemed contrived.", "I was about ready to give up on the MCU, to be honest. The villains were ineffectual, non-threatening, and the heroes triumphed every time with barely a loss. Civil War was especially disappointing to me in this regard - in the comic book storyline, the panel where Cap lies dead before Iron Man was one of the most personally impactful in Marvel comics. \nHowever, Infinity War does superhero movies right. It's big, it's loud, it's got enough lightheartedness so that you are still aware it's a popcorn movie based on a comic book - it's just fun. It does Thanos right, probably the most worrisome part of the film for me going in. If they couldn't make Thanos threatening, I would have stopped watching. But they did it. Whether they have the guts to stick with their decision in regards to the ending will be something else entirely, but for now, Infinity War has sated my appetite for a superhero movie. \nWhile I don't think it'll be something I'll watch twenty years from now like Blade Runner and will inspire deep, complicated thoughts, Infinity War truly was an epic spectacle, and if you were a fan of any of the previous MCU movies, there'll be something in this one for you.", "1. Captain America new look wasn't so appealing. He always looked better the way he was. \n2. Groot wasn't supposed to die. Thanos destroys half population of each race. But Groot was the last remaining of his species. Shouldn't have died.", "How does't feel when someone said incomplete sentince ?  Superheros movies is my thing, but the avengers should stop at one point were there is an end ... and you are not giving that end and you will not ( ANYTIME SOON ) ! \nI loved the blog of the movie, also how it ends. but you should have put an end for avengers serious and start new thing. This is last time I watch avengers on Cinema, only free TV ... Till I know for sure it ends there !", "Great concept great timeline. Completely understand the fast pace. But missing the Marvel factor.", "Be prepared to have your expectations for the film, met. And your expectations for how poorly the crowds will behave around you, dismally disappointing. This movie would be perfect if it weren't for the obnoxious fans.", "Could've been a bloated mess but the Russo brothers juggle the huge cast well (although a few characters felt underused). The characterisation of Thanos really underpins the whole thing though - a rounded and well written villain for once.  Some more character beats for the main cast would have been nice but that would probably have extended the run time to 3 hours plus - which would have been fine with me.  Brilliant fun", "This is it, this is what everything has been building to since Iron Man first graced the screen in 2008. Thanos has come for the Infinity Stones, and it looks like not even the Avengers can stand in his way. This film had a massive burden to carry: how to juggle the characters from the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther all in one movie without them stepping on each other's toes for their time in the spotlight. Despite all the odds, the Russo Brothers actually managed to pull this feat off, with every character actually fulfilling a useful role without feeling superfluous. Where this film shines is in the interactions between characters who have been isolated up until now, much like the first Avengers: Iron Man and Star-Lord, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, Thor and Groot. The chemistry between these people is what binds this film together into something that even fans of only one character can enjoy among the ensemble. What really drives the film, though, is Thanos, the man who we have only seen glimpses of in three films up until this moment. This film really strives to frame Thanos in such a way that while you can't justify his actions, you can sympathize, or at least understand, why he does what he does. Plus, it explores the relationship that was only discussed in passing in both Guardians films, namely his status as father to Gamora and Nebula. Their dynamic is among the stronger reasons why Thanoscan be considered one of the best villains of the MCU. Where this film falters, however, is when it repeats the mistakes previous Marvel films have made. Two films come to mind when discussing this film's issues: Avengers Age of Ultron and Thor Ragnarok. Firstly, this film is really funny. The jokes are hysterical, especially the deep callbacks to previous films and the natural way they come about. There's nothing wrong with being funny. The problem comes in, much like it did in Thor Ragnarok, when the humor ends up coming at inopportune moments and it kills the dramatic tension. This is especially bad when characters discuss immensely serious matters, and a joke come in and lingers for so long, as if to reassure the audience \"hey, we're still having fun, right guys?\" Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, is the problem with stakes. Coming into this film, one of the big questions on everyone's minds was would one of the main characters die in this film. After all, a couple of the main actors, especially Chris Evans, have stated their run as their Marvel characters were coming to an end. And without getting into details, this is the same problem as with Age of Ultron. When the script calls for the main threat as something that will potentially destroy all of the Avengers, you know it won't happen for one basic reason: Disney wants to continue to take your money from these immensely popular films. So, they know they can't do anything too serious otherwise they risk cutting off their cash flow. Nevertheless, despite these problems, it is worth seeing this latest Avengers film, especially for its setup of things to come. It's not the best Marvel film by a long shot, but maybe it didn't need to be."]}
