{"Toy Story": [["Technically impressive with great script and sharp wit", "Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!"], ["Created a decade ago, but still stunning", "I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10."], ["Excellent Viewing, Every Time!", "This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel."], ["Best animated movies ever made", "Toy Story is one of my favourite animated films! Even as an adult I can still watch it and be entertained.

It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc\u0085 But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers').But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made \u2013 something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.''Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films \u2013 not sequels \u2013 by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway."], ["Plastic Fantastic.", "Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking!In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels \u0096 in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature \u0096 just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *id\u00e9e fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz \u0096 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system\u0085."], ["Every Kid's Fantasy", "Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.55 out of 65 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["One of the Best Animated Films Ever!", "Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.

The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices.And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs \u0096 note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect.

He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose!Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool!Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the \"real world of toys\".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the \"chosen ones\", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. \"Nirvana is coming!\" the aliens whisper, watching as the \"chosen ones\" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is \"just an ordinary toy\" who \"can not fly\". \"Flying\" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the \"flesh\" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become \"something more\".Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. \"I am not a toy!\" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump \u2013 a literal leap of faith \u2013 and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What's the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise? It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (\"Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?\").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not \"up in the skies\". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the \"greater good of his family\" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the \"moral code\" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: \"To Infinity and Beyond!\"8.9/10 \u2013 With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, \"Toy Story\" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since \"Snow White\".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, \"The Incredibles\". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings."], ["The World Of Andy's Room", "Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.\"Toy Story\" is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when \"Toy Story\" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that \"Kelly's Heroes\" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines (\"I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school\"), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated \"Galaxy Quest.\"While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. \"A Bug's Life\" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, \"Toy Story\" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of \"the claw.\" If it reached for pathos a little less often, \"Toy Story\" would be an undeniable classic.As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones."], ["The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.", "With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence.How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history.I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then.Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10."], ["A born classic.. nouveau.

Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add.

We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of \"Toy Story's\" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again.

In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new \"it\" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit \"Finding Nemo\" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, \"Toy Story\" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R.

And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie.But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination.

It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the \"humanity\" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them.

Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner.

Something that led to the reinvention of Disney.Its an iconic turning point, like \"Citizen Kane,\" \"2001,\" \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" Greenaway's \"Tempest.\" (and others) Many things after change.So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years.What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until \"Nemo.\" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects.

The shading of certain objects, cracks or spills could be the difference between a human look or manufactured. The lighting had to be hard to create the film. They had some dramatic moody lights in Sid's room, flashlight stuff, daylight, bright sun for all sorts of different kinds of environments.When they add light it gives more a visual interest for viewers and hide some flaw in animation.

It is a simple concept that is executed beautifully with wit, charm and heart that sustains to this day and (I would imagine) to infinity...and beyond.Besides the revolutionary CGI work (which mostly holds up), the heartwarming story and the crispness of the pacing of the film, the masterstroke here is the pitch perfect voice casting. Tom Hanks was the first - and only - choice for Woody, the Cowboy doll that has been the main toy for Andy. His confidence is shattered when Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday and he struggles to maintain control of the room - and Andy's heart. In lesser hands, this character could be be annoying and a bit of a jerk, but with Hanks' inherent charm, Woody is lovable, neurotic and vulnerable as he tries to get out of one jam after another.Tim Allen wasn't the first choice for the voice of Buzz Lightyear, but with his success in 1994's THE SANTA CLAUS he was called into service on this film - and the results couldn't be better. He blends machismo, bluster and a sincere earnestness that perfectly pairs and counterbalances Hanks' tics to form a movie duo that ranks right up there with the best in film history.It is the attention to detail that these filmmakers really excel at and the supporting cast of voice actors really brings it here. From Don Rickles to John Ratzenberger to Annie Potts to R. Lee Emery to Jim Varney to Laurie Metcalf, all bring charm and heart to their characters even when they are in conflict.Speaking of attention to detail, the CGI in this film works really, really well - even after 23 years of improvements. The filmmakers were blazing a trail and there is much to look at in the background, from the 2 \"Hidden Mickey's\" in Andy's room to the tribute to THE SHINING, the background and renderings are lush and are worth a viewing just to look at hidden gems (and Easter Eggs) in the background.But none of this would matter if the story wasn't any good and I give story writers Lasseter and future Pixar Director's Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton credit for keeping the story crisp, clear and simple and infusing heart and sincerity without getting cloying or annoying. Interestingly enough, in looking at the credits, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow were all contributors to the screenplay as well. When I see that many writers on a screenplay, I worry about continuity and flow. But, make no mistake about it, this film has a strong vision driven by Lasseter and the results on the screen show that focus.If you haven't seen this film in awhile, give yourself a treat and check it out again, it holds up very, very well and will be well worth the 84 minutes it will take to watch it (the shortest of all PIXAR films).Letter Grade A+ - which means, of course...A rare 10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"], ["Four E's Short Review", "Entertaining (How enjoyable is the movie to me): 10\nEscapist (How involved was I in the movie's world): 10\nEmotional (How much did it make me feel): 9\nEnlightening (How much did I learn about the universe and myself): 81 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["So much nostalgia :)", "Toy Story is a really fun movie to watch especially for kids and the story is so good.1 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Funny and Great Movie", "Im 30 and still love this movie.

It is the first of its kind, really. The very first feature-length computer-animated film and the founding stone of Pixar Studios. And quite like Snow White, it is still a marvelous film. With certain, minor caveats.First the praise. The story is still incredible. It has to be for the film to have withstood the test of time so well. It is about toys coming to life when humans are away at least partly because toys were much easier to animate than real humans (the humans in this film look scary, by the way), but great storytelling is often inspired by limitations. And that certainly applies here. Through simple childhood toys we explore the concepts of growing up, learning new things, meeting new people, dealing with failed expectations, fear of loss, abandonment and betrayal, letting go of things, and most importantly, about friendship and family. And it's all told through a fetching, relatable and kid-friendly narrative.The characters are also a lot of fun, though as a kid I never realized what a jerk Woody (Tom Hanks) really is. Sure, that's his point, but I always though that the cowboy had something of a point. Perhaps kids see these things differently. And nevertheless, the idea that Woody was in the wrong was clear even back then.Unfortunately what hasn't aged so well is the animation. The humans look terrible, yes, but that was clear even in 1995. But the toys were phenomenal back then. Mindblowing, quite frankly. Less so today. The movement is still really smooth and the designs are interesting, but it all looks so plasticky. The movie works around that admirably - most of the characters are made of plastic, after all - but it still leaves the movie looking flat and lifeless even when it's not supposed to look like it. I've heard it said that early hand-drawn animation looks charmingly simple, whereas early computer-animation simply looks cheap. And there's some truth to that, I'm afraid to tell.Still, Toy Story is a classic. Not my favourite Pixar film by far, but it did start something quite wonderful."], ["To the infinity and beyond!!", "Pixar's first major smash hit and one of the first entirely computer animated films may not have aged well, considering the huge steps CGI characters have taken since 1995. Its biggest assets, a huge beating heart and a great sense of humor, still work so many years later and let you forget about the sometimes flat textures. The story, the characters and the jokes are what draws you into the story and soon after you forget you're actually watching an adventure about living toys. The great voice acting helps too, of course. The result, a glorious collection of exciting and fun action scenes, is so perfect, you sometimes feel the urge to clap applause in responds to the events on the screen. The voice cast of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen fit the characters of Woody and Buzz so perfectly, this film should be seen as a major highlight in their careers. From Pizza Planet, to Sid's House and the race for the moving truck, this film features plenty of memorable scenes and locations. Randy Newman's song \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" is undeniably one of the best songs to be featured in a Pixar film, shame it didn't win the Oscar for 'Best Original Song' that it deserved.

Toy Story follows a group of anthropomorphic toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, and focuses on Woody, a pullstring cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure . Woody feels profoundly threatened and jealous when Buzz supplants him as the top toy in the room. The film was written and directed by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, and Joss Whedon, and featured music by Randy Newman.The star of the proceedings is Woody, a pull-string cowboy toy belonging to a wide-eyed youngster named Andy. Whenever Andy's out of the room, Woody revels in his status as the boy's number one toy. His supremacy is challenged by a high-tech, space-ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who, unlike Woody and his pals, believes that he is real and not merely a plaything. The rivalry between Woody and Buzz hilariously intensifies during the first half of the film, but when the well-being of Andy's toys is threatened by a nasty next-door neighbor kid named Sid whose idea of fun is feeding stuffed dolls to his snarling dog and reconstructing his own toys into hideous mutants such as Woody and Buzz join forces to save the day.There is greatness in film that can be discussed, dissected, and talked about late into the night. Then there is genius that is right in front of our faces--we smile at the spell it puts us into and are refreshed, and nary a word needs to be spoken. This kind of entertainment is what they used to call \"movie magic,\" and there is loads of it in this irresistible computer animation feature. Just a picture of these bright toys reawaken the kid in us.

It features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger and Laurie Metcalfe. Music is by Randy Newman.The first feature-length film animated entirely by computer, there's not a lot that can be said now that hasn't been said before about Toy Story, both as a film of heart and substance, and as regards its importance in the world of animation. Two further sequels would follow, both enormously successful and both equally as enjoyable. But it began here in 95, where Woody, Buzz and the gang operated on a level that beguiled the children whilst simultaneously bringing knowing laughs to the accompanying adults. Pixar paint a vivid colourful world, bringing us down to the toys level and etching in emotive threads about jealousies, friendships, neuroses' and the relationship between a child and his toys, while youthful splendour bathes the film constantly. Even though the plot is simple in terms of ambition, the characterisations are substantial and the film never panders to political correctness. The voice work of the actors is terrific, especially Hanks and Allen as Woody and Buzz respectively, their vocal comedy ticks wonderfully bring life to the animated figures, while Newman adds his optimistic tunes into the mix.Never maudlin or cheesy with its messages and sombre moments (something some other Disney films can't lay claim too), Toy Story's only crime is being too short at an hour and fifteen minutes (both subsequent sequels would rectify this issue).

Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation: we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's \"Toy Story\" was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". It's not surprising, by the way, that the two films are the only animated features included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 List.The comparison with \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" doesn't only rely on the technical achievement and the critical recognition, but also on what drove these two crucial aspects: an endearing and universally appealing story. \"Snow White\" exploited all the comical possibilities of the dwarfs, in order to use physically distinct characters with different personalities attributed to each of them, while the Queen and Snow White could be modeled in more realistic designs; the setting also allowed the drawers to extend their talents and give it the touch of magic and escapism the audiences needed back then. \"Toy Story\" does the exact same thing, it chooses the best setting that can justify a clever and playful use of three-dimensionality, by creating a sort of underworld made of different forms and colors, a world where toys come to life when the owner is absent. This choice is a strike of genius because it provides an escapist value in our own environment, Disney made enough movies set in forests, mountains, jungles, so for its first 3D film, we have the first in-door Disney film, which gives an irresistible feeling of intimacy.This simplicity is the perfect counterpart to the complexity of special effects and the creativity of the screenplay because it also succeeds to add a little touch of nostalgia and hit a sensitive chord by waking the inner child inside of us. In 1995, we're in the midst of Disney Renaissance and its streak of successful films was so full of adventures and romance, thrills and laughs that \"Toy Story\" almost resonates as a comeback to the roots of the Walt Disney Company, childhood. Haven't we all played with toys when we were kids, whether they were dolls, Smurfs figurines, cars, monsters, haven't we all used our hands, totally invisible for our little eyes, and talked instead of characters, like magical puppeteers, imagining them sliding from a ravine that was our bathtub, or escalating a mountain, the bed-pillow. Toys were always alive for us, because our games were precisely what brought them to life, and in \"Toy Story\", we always have the feeling that the creators are less 'making a film' than playing with toys like we used to do, engaging a tacit complicity with the kids in the audience, and the inner kids within the adults from the audience.\"Toy Story\" assumes that toys are alive, and the script is so well written that we're immediately convinced. There's no way Woody, the cowboy doll with Tom Hanks' voice couldn't be alive, that the cocky Buzz Lightyear is only a 3D talking image, that Mr. Potato Head isn't that grouchy figurine or that the Tyrannosaurus isn't that cute andcoward creature, all the toys that belong to little Andy incarnate Disney's magical power, bringing things to life, and we realize how we all had a Disney inside us when we were playing with our toys. And \"Toy Story\" couldn't have a more appropriate villain than a kid who destroyed toys, Sid: a character I despised so much because I was definitely not a Sid when I was younger. \"Toy Story\" is an odyssey in the world of toys after which we don't look at them the same way, calling them objects is almost insulting. Indeed, I've always felt guilty because as a teen, my mother told me to get rid of my toys, to give them to needier boys, and although I didn't play with them anymore, I remember how painful it was to say them goodbye, after \"Toy Story\", now I feel better with myself.And \"Toy Story\" doesn't just take its creativity and the cuteness of its characters for granted, there are the lines, the humor, but the story too, starting with the antagonism between the two 'lead' toys. Woody is jealous because Buzz, Andy's new birthday gift, became his best friend, in other words, his favorite toy, while Buzz doesn't know he's only a toy and lives in total denial about his true nature, which adds an unexpected bit of poignancy to characters that are not just three-dimensional on a geometrical level. The film has its share of action, mostly with the Buzz and Woody's duo trying to get back to Andy's house before the family moves in, but the emotional core of the film is their friendship.

Careful, artistic shot selection and playful direction really do a lot to compensate for the occasional bad render, and a world-class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest.

This leads into fr-enemy rivalry involving these two toys, until they learn the true meaning of friendship. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide the voices for these well-known characters, and they did a great job of bringing talking toys to life.

Haven't you ever wondered what your toys do when you aren't there. I know I did when I was a kid, I myself had a buzz lightyear doll and I always imagined him having that Tim Allen voice.not only does it fulfill the child's dream, but there is a ton of easter eggs that pixar has included that will keep the teenagers and adults interested and laughing as well. Even 16 years after the original release date I still watch the movie and I am still finding little subliminal messages (easter eggs) that pixar has included.Disney/ pixar headed by john lassetter do a great job in making an unbelievable movie seem as believable as possible. Just for a second forget that these are toys we are talking about here and imagine that they are real people. Would they have acted any different to how they did? Knowing that what the characters did and how they reacted and how it is on unreasonable to consider that they might act that way is the key to good script writing and good storytelling. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen also do a marvellous job at heading the cast making every line seem funnier or more dramatic than it actually is.Overall i would not just recommend this, this is a MUST SEE for any kid or adult.

The attention to detail is exquisite in this picture as reflections, flexibilities, and movement are all captured in such a stunning format it's almost too much to comprehend. Everything moves so fluently, is crafted with such a broad mind it's still astonishing to this date.CGI animation is made with wondrous creativity and the possibilities to show off it's style are virtually unlimited. Though when companies in 2011 make kids movies like these they forget about the storyline and just make the film loud and colorful to attract the youth's attention. Not Pixar. Pixar is so much smarter. They understand good animation and a great storyline with characters. Show me a Pixar movie that isn't at least above average and I'll show you a car that can you can drive with no wheels.But CGI animation has it's downsides. Being released in 1995, Toy Story was the first computer animated film. Meaning other companies were racing their technology where everyone wanted to take advantage of the CGI craze. The main company in this heated competition was DreamWorks Animation Studios. Their first feature film was Antz, notable for being almost a direct knockoff of Pixar's A Bug's Life which came out the same year (1998). Following Antz came others like Chicken Run and The Road to El Dorado. Still none of which lived up to Toy Story's caliber.DreamWorks scored big when releasing Shrek in 2001. It definitely put them on the map of animation companies, and it's surely remembered more than Chicken Run. But still, while Shrek had a more rapid fire sequel release schedule than Toy Story, none of which had the same heart, message, or love any of these films had.One last downside is that CGI, no matter which way you look at it, killed hand drawn animation. Generations of kids now likely will never get to experience the classic animation like they should. If they do they will most likely hate it after being exposed to all the glossy and more stylish animation that is among us today. But shows like Beavis and Butthead and The Simpsons are just as good.Enough with the animation history, lets talk about the film. I doubt anyone will disagree with me, that this is one of the greatest animated films of all time. It combines clever antics with loving characters you become attached to. It's funny to think toys have a mind of their own. Plus all the trouble they would experience if they were alive.Andy (Morris) is a typical child. He has a number of toys of different varieties and enjoys making up little adventures the figures can go on. All ranging from a Mr. Potato Head, a cowboy doll, a toy piggy bank, and others. Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll, who now feels threatened when a flashy, gadget filled toy named Buzz Lightyear (Allen) is given to Andy for his birthday. Buzz impresses the entire gang of toys much to the dismay and fear of Woody that he will become another forgotten toy.Simple premise. Giant execution. It's everything and more. In the nineties, this animation was simply groundbreaking. Because this was the first film made by Pixar, the standard hadn't been set yet. But it was clear after Toy Story that animation would be forever changed for more than one reason.Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten.

They have consistently made wonderful animated pictures that are very funny and heartwarming, and all have memorable and soon to be iconic scenes. They never pander to children, nor do they rely on cheap gags or melodrama. This film is the epitome of what PIXAR is about. \"Toy Story\" is one of the greatest animated films, that in recent years has only been topped by a few other PIXAR films.In the world this film sets up, toys are all alive, though they don't let that known to people. They play their roles are toys and when the people are not in sight, they talk about their job of being played with, and their personal lives. It's Andy's birthday, and all the toys in his room are worried about this fate with new toys coming in. Woody the cowboy doll is the leader of the group and is Andy's favorite toy, but Andy just received a new space toy, Buzz Lightyear, and now Woody is playing second fiddle and he doesn't like that. After mistakenly knocking Buzz out the window, the toys turn on Woody and he and Buzz end up on an adventure trying to find Andy and make it back to his house before he and his family move.The characters are always walking a fine line here, and never once do they fall off into one side. Woody could be very unlikable. He's always complaining, shouting all the time and he does some pretty mean things. Woody may be occasionally ill intentioned, but he is never malicious, and instead of being a complete jerk, he is often fighting between what is right and wrong and picks the former. The characters can be mean, but they're well intentioned in the end, and it's what shows in them.This film is of course a technical achievement, boasting that it's the first feature length fully computer animated movie. The animation looks great still today, but in a film world dominated by special effects and computer animation, it's very difficult to impress, but what still stands out about this film's look is it's visual style. From strange mid 50s interior designs to the atmospheric and beautiful golden hour look of certain scenes, this movie has such unique sets and shadows and just the atmosphere overall is very involving. The exciting chase and action sequences are also remembered and still today look dazzling. But what makes those scenes, namely the whole moving van sequence at the end, is the emotion. You feel for these characters, and the \"Falling with style\" callback that could feel contrived and corny, comes off as heartwarming. All the great scenes in the film have a level of humanity underneath all the negativity and cynicism of Woody that makes this animated toy feel very human.Randy Newman can be a little samey in some of his musical work, but his songs and score work very well here. The songs give us insight into what the character is feeling, and raise the emotion. His score plays off really well, and is catchy and bouncy without being cheesy. You'll find yourself singing these songs and humming the music after watching this.Toy Story is animated masterpiece. Unlike many of Disney animation's masterpieces, like the wonderful \"Beauty and the Beast\" or \"The Little Mermaid\", this plays as a film instead of a great animated movie.

Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's 1995-release, been without stock of them!

Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot.All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long!

Since its debut in 1995, dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching.The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has \"been Andy's favorite since kindergarten\". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the #1 toy position in Andy's playtime.There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works 15 years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some \"more mature\" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters.Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story 3 this summer will make eleven.

Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy.

Simple enough for children to enjoy, and yet with enough subtle humour for adults to enjoy as well. In fact, this film was made more for adults than for children I suspect-much of the humour is subtle and adult oriented, and as the makers admit, many of the toys are ones they played with in their childhoods.The toys in the film are actually better actors, and convey more emotion, than most \"actors\" in films today. Kudos to Pixar for an excellent job.A must-see film, it has something for everyone, and loses nothing on repeated viewing.

I now wish I had seen this movie years ago, instead of waiting for a cheap LD clearance sale.TS, while adhering to Disney movie traditions, is an entertaining diversion, and historically important as a computer-rendered movie to boot.  The difference between Disney and Pixar sensibilities concerning humor are evident early on; one is thankful that Disney gave so much lee-way to Pixar concerning story and dialogue.  While I can't say that I was as entertained by the goings-on as average Disney fans, I can say that the results are much better than standard Disney fare.  (In fact, if you can find this for under $50 on laserdisc, I can assure that your entertainment dollar is well-spent)The LD contains the pre-TS Pixar shorts (worth the price of admission) as well as director's comments, and much more.  The LD is probably the best deal I've had in a while, and I recommend that everyone- despite their feelings towards Disney- get this LD set.

But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise.7 out of 18 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Cynical and disturbing", "This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect.[Possible spoiler:]The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film."], ["Overrated", "I didn't see this until recently and it might have a lot to do with this show just being older now but the movie didn't look very good, the effects were all pretty out of date. I'm sure they were good at the time but they really don't hold up. The story was just OK and very predictable even for a children's movie. I liked some of the one liners but there wasn't much point for me in watching this, I didn't enjoy it and knew everything that was going to happen. It also probably didn't help that I am not a fan of Tom Hanks or the Tool Time guy (Tim Allen?) who did the voice of Buzz Lightyear.

Over the years I've come to dislike it rather than feeling neutral toward it. The concept of the movie wasn't new to me because I had already seen the Jim Henson film The Christmas Toy which was basically the same but instead of Woody the cowboy being the main character it was a tiger plush toy named Rigby and I prefer puppetry over CG anyway. Given that this movie was made in the early days of CG the people look really weird and fake, almost creepy, even the good characters. It seems to mainly focus on the petty squabbles between the jealous cowboy and the delusional spaceman. While the film has a few jokes the kids might not get, my over all impression is that the whole story lacks depth. You could maybe read between the lines and infer things but the movie glosses over most of the more serious stuff to keep the mood light. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable either.6 out of 19 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["\"I'm not really from Mattel...I'm from a smaller company purchased in a leveraged buyout.\"", "A kid's bedroom full of toys comes to life when humans aren't around; each toy, both new and retro-vintage, has his or her own individual personality, and they're all thrilled to meet the new member of the pack, birthday present Buzz Lightyear, who just may usurp Sheriff Woody in their pre-teen owner's heart. Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture.

Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood.The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move.Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort.Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining."], ["Fantastic Revolutionary Computer Animation Classic", "The toys in Andy's bedroom are worried when he gets a new Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger for his birthday. Sheriff Woody is jealous, but when he knocks Buzz out of the window by accident, he must face the outside world and go rescue him.Toy Story is a World's First movie. The use of computer-generated animation had been pioneered in other films (Tron, The Last Starfighter, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, etc) and had been used extensively in short films (such as Lasseter's classic Luxo Jr., the origin of the Pixar company desklamp logo), but Toy Story is the original computer-rendered animation movie and its visual dynamics are simply stunning. In particular, the generation of movement through the frame (such as the point-of-view shot of Andy running up the stairs) and the ability to perfectly map any number of light sources to the motion of objects are amazing techniques previously unheard of in standard cell-painted animation. Lasseter and his incredible crew of artists have created an animation world which can duplicate almost anything a three-dimensional live-action movie could. It's an incredible achievement. Much more importantly however, it's a great movie - funny, scary, jam-packed full of great characters, and a terrific story. It has two ideas that are just brilliant; firstly, the central conceit of the toys coming to life, and secondly, Buzz struggling to come to terms with his identity. It kinda reminds me of a kids version of Robocop; on the one hand it's a goofy adventure story but on the other it's really almost a philosophical fable about a guy facing the meaninglessness of existence ! I also love the sheer variety of the toys, both visually and character-wise; as well as Andy's toys, Sid's monstrous hybrids are fabulous and the wacko three-eye greenies are hilarious (\"Nirvana is coming ! The mystic portal awaits !!\"). The voice cast are terrific, particularly Allen, Shawn and Ermey, and the movie sounds just as good as it looks, with excellent sound design by Gary Rydstrom. My one complaint is Randy Newman's song score, which is okay, but I'm afraid his laid-back LA showtunes style grates with me, and does he really need six credits for it ? Anyway, this is a great movie for everybody, kids and adults alike, and a genuine pleasure to watch.

Toy Story was originated by John Lasseter himself, Joe Ranft, who wrote The Lion King & Beauty and the Beast, and the start of the iconic Pete Docter & Andrew Stanton as well.Toy Story broke so many barriers, creating the first movie about toys, when we're not around, while giving them humanized traits, and problems, (I knew I wasn't the only one who used to think about my toys when I wasn't around, as a kid). It's almost impossible not to praise this movie, being one of few movies being 100% critically acclaimed by Rotten Tomatoes, and critics everywhere. Toy Story was an inventive family-film, created twenty-five years ago, and other than some mediocre animations, the movie still holds up tremendously today! It is beautifully paced, while having high risks at all times.Before I jump into these amazing characters, I want to give credit to Janet Hirshen, Mike Fenton, Jane Jenkins & Ruth Lambert, for casting the absolute best voice over cast, someone could've ever put together. Sheriff Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the clear cut leader of the toys. Woody is the smartest of the group, stealing every scene he's in, with tremendous character development. Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, was a super enjoyable character, adding this toy personality, compared to everyone else's humanized personalities. Buzz complimented Woody very well throughout the whole film, creating a decent share of the risks that take place. Rex, voiced by Wallace Shawn, was almost indefinitely the best character in the movie. He is by far the funniest of the group, adding an unexpected twist to his personality. Mr. Potato Head, voiced by Don Rickles, acted as the dad character, with such a negative attitude, that clashed brilliantly with everyone. Hamm, voiced by John Ratzenberger, was one of the smartest of the pack, being very blunt, and right to the point. Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, was Woody's right hand man, being the most matured toy of the group. Our antagonist in Sid, is just as diabolical as the Joker, Thanos, & Scar. He is so dark and creepy, and poses a huge traumatic threat to any toy in the area, or in his possession.The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, Bud Luckey, Pete Docter, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow, was so pleasing for the kids and the adults, sneaking in their fair share of adult jokes.Toy Story was the first beautiful full length CG animated film. For 1995, these animations were essentially flawless. The production designers in Patsy Bouge & Karen Robert Jackson, created these brilliant sets & set pieces, with amazing sizeable shots.The score & music by Randy Newman worked phenomenally with the story. Not only was You Got a Friend in Me, a smash hit, but Strange Things Are Happening To Me, as well.Overall, even though this movie had very minuscule nitpicks, this movie was essentially flawless!

I remembered all of the little details which were about to happen before they did, but that didn't make the film predictable. It made it more special, remembering which bits I used to laugh at with my dad, back in the day.Pixar eventually became known for creating animated films which contained an extremely deep message, but this was their first one out of the gate and I picked up on a lot more of these meanings upon rewatch.Underneath the animation is a wonderfully profound story about losing your way in life and realising who you are actually meant to be. There are also references to depression, and it's all handled in an extremely effective way because it contains these deep themes which adults can reflect upon whilst also having an incredibly entertaining story which kids can enjoy.I don't think the film is perfect because it only stretches for about 75 minutes and the pacing can be a little wonky at times, but the pros of the film outweigh the cons by a mile and this is still one of Pixar's best movies to date. The last fifteen minutes is also one of the best quarter of an hours that I have ever seen in an animated film, as it's full of tension, excitement, and emotion.

Buzz is the newcomer and he replaces Woody as Andy's favorite toy.

Rather than filling the time with cute animals, catchy songs, and a story that caters to the lowest, or youngest, common denominator, each of these elements is subtly accentuated and elevated so adults in the audience can appreciate the humor, themes, and well crafted narrative alongside the youth in the audience that are the film's target demographic.The Bad:\nIt's very difficult, if not impossible, to find fault with this film. Since it's release, Toy Story has been lauded for every aspect of its production by critics, industry insiders, and audiences at large. But, the years that have past since the film's release have become its biggest drawback. Pixar has released 20 films since Toy Story graced the screens at the time of this writing, including 3 direct sequels to this film. With each new film Pixar has released they've innovated the technology and techniques to define the ever-evolving standard of computer animated films. With each new benchmark in the genre this film has fallen further and further behind looking less and less like the state of the art film that it was in 1995.The Ugly:\nTo piggy-back off of my \"Bad\" for this film, it's hard to find a film that did it better than this, but perhaps we can look to the direct sequel, Toy Story 2 (John Lasseter, Ash Brannon, and Lee Unkrich, 1999). This follow up did everything to one-up it's predecessor. It expanded the world around Woody, Buzz, and company outside of a few simple settings and added an exposition for Woody that accentuates a part of what was good about the first film. Adult viewers at the time of release might have been taken back to their own youths and the corporate studio television shows with toy tie-ins like The Mickey Mouse Club and Howdy Doody. With growth and maturity in the studio's ability to create engrossing stories and improvements in animation in the four years between releases, this film further entrenched the franchise, and solidified Pixar as the premier computer animation studio."], ["A Disney cult", "The first time I saw this movie I was four,and I know it is a \"movie for kids\" but even if I watch it today,i can see new Easter eggs or scenes that only adults can understand.\nMoreover,this film is the first animated movie full developed in computer graphics.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["The first feature-length CGI movie is not a disappointment", "While in general I tend to go for the classic animation style as opposed to all the fancy CGI stuff that goes on nowadays, you have to admit: These Disney-Pixar features are really quite entertaining. While this 3-d animation style has been overused a lot over the past decade, the films are admittedly fun, creative, and suspenseful; they are movies for all ages; and they are, furthermore, among the best and most harmless children's classics to be found today (set aside the upcoming \"Frozen II\").\"Toy Story\" was, from what I gather, Pixar's first film and also the world's first CGI feature length movie. It plays upon an old, used but still timeless concept: that of toys and inanimate objects coming to life whilst the owners are away. In \"Toy Story\", the main characters are toy cowboy named Woody and toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear. (Call me crazy, but I am not familiar with either and still enjoyed it; you do not need to understand whom the toys are based upon to like it). Woody is the leader of all the toys in Andy's room, where they are played with every day. In their spare time, they come to life to have their own fun, and Woody (being the favorite) enjoys being in charge. Until Buzz shows up on Andy's birthday, and becomes the new favorite with all his fancy gear, 'lasers' and such. The two are soon in competition, which results in both ending up outside their house where a dangerous and ridiculously crazy adventure awaits.That being the basic synopsis, you can tell that in terms of storyline the movie is very simplistic. Yet it doesn't need a complex and overblown plot to be fun (although the ridiculously absurd ending is admittedly overdone) and in terms of intrigue and comedy it does a pretty good job. The characters are easy to sympathize with (how many of us have felt rejected over someone else?) and the parts are well-played. Woody and Buzz both work quite well in character--even if Woody is a completely self-centered jerk--and the minor parts are also nicely done. (As pointed out by other reviewers, the supporting cast of toys mostly deliver the comedy, although Woody's \"Mr. Light-Beer\" is a definite winner). For the most part, it is entirely child-friendly, although I can imagine that many kids would be a little frightened by Sid--who is more like Satan-as-a-mad-doctor in human form than a neighborhood kid. (Also, what kind of parents lets their kid play with fireworks?). As I said before, the crazy ending is as overblown as it gets, but that's part of what makes it memorable.In general, a fun film for families or otherwise, and definitely a classic when it comes to CGI animation. Only about an hour and a half and it does not pad itself out and stays within the appropriate run-time bounds. A nice update on the 'living toys' motif."], ["Iconic Movie", "The movie that started it all, goes without saying but this is the best one!0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A Film That Made My Childhood", "Introduction:\n\"Toy Story\" was the first film to come out of Pixar. And frankly, it still remains as one of the best. While, in my opinion, the weakest film in the series, that doesn't mean it's at all bad. Toy Story is still an amazing film, and one of the best animated films of all time.The Story:\nTelling the story of two enemies that becomes best friends by the end. Not needing to be complicated, the film tells a very simple story, that can be enjoyed by adults and kids.And I just love the idea of what the toys in your room are up to while you're not looking.The Characters:\nWoody and Buzz Light-year are two of my favorite characters in all of cinema. As they both go through their respective arcs. Woody learning that he doesn't have to be the center of his owner Andy's attention. And Buzz, who learns that he can accept the place he has in the world.The Animation:\nBeing the first full length computer animated movie, the style was impressive for time, but is not all that impressive today. However, it did look good back then, and I can forgive the film.Conclusion:\nToy Story may not be my favorite in the Toy Story series, but it's still a great film. And one of my favorite films of all time."], ["Solid, whimsical and charmingly animated", "With a simple story but cheerful and whimsically energetic characters, John Lasseter provides an incredibly efficient and beautiful animated flick that'll represent PIXAR's quick-start full length feature, offering complex ideas that will be enjoyable for youngsters and adults alike, and delivering great voice casting that'll include the eternally appealing chemistry between stars, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, as the iconic duet; Woody and Buzz Lightyear.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["REVOLUTIONARY", "Though I don't love it as much as everyone else, \"Toy Story\" is still wonderful.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Toy Story was technologically groundbreaking, but also a heartwarming and original adventure", "Honestly, I don't think I can fully appreciate Toy Story's boldness and uniqueness, as Pixar has since made great family computer generated animated movies ubiquitous, and I certainly have been able to take that for granted my whole life. Even so, watching Toy Story for the first time in over a decade, it exceeded my expectations in its characters and script, and the animation looks as good as ever. Woody's internal struggles and seeing a protagonist of a kid's movie be clearly flawed but still likable is so refreshing. I love the animosity between Woody and Buzz, and the way the toys each have their own quirks but are something of a hive mind. Even if the events that occur are a bit over the top, the structure and plot is actually really exciting and coherently presented. I loved the misjudgement of Sid's toys and their role in the success. I've seen movies twice as long fail to deliver on half as realistic and well fleshed out characters or emotional stakes as in Toy Story. Between the groundbreaking animation for the time, the consistent characters and plot, and sheer adolescent joy and adventure, Toy Story deserves its place as a classic.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Toy Story (1995) - 8.2", "Toy Story (1995) - 8.2Act 1 - 8.2Act 2 - 7.7Act 3 - 8.6Changed animation foreverAnimation still holds upAmazing conceptGreat voice acting that fits every characterWoody is jealous of Buzz for becoming Andy's new favorite toyWoody is having trouble accepting this change in his lifeWoody has to accept the change in his life and realize that Andy's taste will change over time, this uproots Woody's whole lifeBuzz also has to deal with change in his life and goes on an arc learning that he is a toy and not real as he believesSolid dry humorSeparates Buzz and Woody from the other toys so they can go on a physical and physiological journey as they grow and learn togetherWoody teaches Buzz the joys and importance of being a toy while exposing his own insecuritiesStart of a long lasting and endearing friendship over the filmsToys reveal that they are alive to Sid to save Buzz, tell Sid not to do bad things to toys anymoreWoody and Buzz both try to sacrifice themselves for each other cementing their new found friendshipIs a comedy and an adventure filmVery good movie that still holds up"], ["The best movie of my childhood", "The best movie of my childhood.

What sets it apart from pretty much all others in its genre is just how flawed its protagonist is. He's a borderline anti-hero, self-destructively selfish for the movie's majority. This makes his arc all the more satisfying, though, even if it's about as classic as you can get. The friendship that forms between the two central characters feels palpable and genuinely fulfilling because it's nuanced and consistently strained. It really is remarkable that a film about talking toys has some of the most satisfying character arcs and central relationships of all time. Of course, the piece is also very funny. It fully uses its central conceit to deliver some truly inventive laughs. It doesn't feel as though it's pandering to children, either; in fact, it feels rather mature, all things considered. It's a fantastic time that will resonate with everyone who watches. It really is a classic, one to be considered amongst the greats - animated or otherwise. 10/100 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["You got a friend in me", "Toy Story is one of the best animated movie of the year, it has one incredible Toy Stories to tell, it's has heart, humor, and every best moments you don't wanna miss.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A Perfect Start to a New Animation Era", "This film was the very beginning of CG animated films that completely dominate the animation industry now. And seeing as it is the very first of its kind, a likely assumption is that it is not very good. However when you watch this film you will find out that is so far from the truth.\nToy Story not only started a new art style, a new era of film, comedy, and entertainment, but it also is a genuinely heartfelt incredible film! Pixar was able to make human beings feel sympathy for inanimate objects. That alone is noteworthy, but it goes even farther than that. This film is so entertaining and exciting; you will not want to look away from the screen.

Joint with 2 and 3", "No wait, I literally cannot rank all three Toy Story movies because i love them all equally. But if i had to choose i would probably say 1,3 and then 2. I mean what's not to love about Toy Story. A sharp-witted, cleverly written story about toys coming to life. I mean, do you notice why there hasn't been another big or successful film following the same idea of toys coming to life. Because, this is the perfect one. Nothing will ever be able to top it. They've set the bar way too high. Such a great premise which is played off brilliantly. Tom Hanks is my favorite ever animated voice actor. The energy he radiates through his words prove why he is my favorite actor of all time. His best quote OBVIOUSLY being \"YOU ARE A TOYYYYY!!!!!\" Tim Allen also does an excellent job. Especially, with the 'Mrs Nesbitt!!' scene and bits from earlier on when he believes he is a Space Ranger. Other actors like John Ratzenberger and Don Rickles do well and Wallace Shawn does a great job with voicing the lovable dinosaur Rex. However, this is by far my favorite Pixar film, but not my favorite Disney or animated film in general. I would have to give that to 'The Lion King.' At the time, this film would have been so technically impressive. I mean this was mid 90's and the affects still look great today. With such a great premise for a film, it plays it to it's advantages and making everyday boring objects seem like an obstacle for the toys. Probably the best example of this is 'The Claaaw.' Yes, the arcade machine that is often criticized for scamming people by making them pay money for a slim chance of winning a soft toy is used as a plot device. But does that stop me from getting that Spider-man or Ant Man plushie. Hell no! The world they create through the film is so creative and well done that it's hard not to call the film a masterpiece. So let's talk about the plot. Woody is a cowboy toy who is the leader of all the other toys in Andy's room. The toys job is to be played with and keep Andy happy. Oh and also not to be seen alive. Anyway, on Andy's birthday a new toy shows up. A popular space ranger toy named Buzz Lightyear. However, Buzz actually believes he is a space ranger and not a toy. He proves it by 'flying' when instead he is just using a hot wheels track and a lampshade to swing around. This leads top one of the greatest film quotes of all time \"That wasn't flying that was falling with style.\" However, both the toys and Andy seem to admire Buzz leaving Woody jealous. Which refers to the astronaut takeover in the 1960's when kids stopped idolizing cowboys and began idolizing astronauts and 'space rangers.' Woody creates a plan to get rid of Buzz by pushing him out of the window. It works but leads to him and Buzz getting stranded at a gas station. They manage to follow Andy to a Pizza and arcade building (basically Chuck E Cheese) where they are captured by evil next door neighbor Sid who blows toys up for fun. Here, Buzz learns through a TV advert and a fall down the stairs that he is a toy after all in quite a powerful and emotional scene. Buzz goes insane while Woody tries to escape with him. Woody realizes that Sid i going to blow him and Buzz up on the same day that Andy is supposed to move house. So Woody hitches a plan using some of Sid's poor toys who fell victim to Sid's evil experiments. Woody uses his string voice to warn Sid about the toys before coming to life to say the words \"So play nice!\" in one of the greatest movie scenes of all time. Buzz finally comes to his senses and him and Woody manage to get to the moving truck in time. So, anyway Toy Story is an animated masterpiece which will always be remembered, not only for it's stunning visuals but it's great story and characters."], ["First time watching after 24 years of it's release", "I gotta say this one of the best pixar movies I've ever seen.. the story line, the animation and the actors that were chosen are just awesome.. great movie.

Andy gets Buzz and becomes obsessed with him. Buzz is popular between the other toys, and he also is starting to get all the play time as well. This of course, makes Woody mad and jealous. Most of the movie Buzz thinks he is a real life space ranger which makes for some pretty good comedy. This annoys Woody also. Basically the whole movie is like some siblings fighting for more attention from their parents. In the middle of all this fighting between the two of them, they end up in the hands of the neighbor Sid. He is the kid next door that sabotages and brakes toys for fun.

Toy Story brings the idea of toys to a whole new level. After watching this movie when I was young I never thought of toys the same. I cared for my toys more and honestly thought that they came to life when I left the room.The humor is great for a kids movie. A lot of the parts where Buzz thinks he is actually a space ranger and he is making fun of Woody always give a nice little chuckle. In one of the scenes Woody is lost from Andy because of Buzz and Woody is screaming at Buzz who still thinks he is a real space ranger and Woody is screaming, \"You're a toy. You're a child's play thing!\" then after that Buzz says,\" You're a sad strange little man, and you have my pity.\" There is also a pretty big change from the beginning of the movie to the end with a great message. I won't spoil the change you'll just have to watch the movie. I will say though, that it might have something to do with one of the themes, friendship.Toy Story has Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the main characters. Woody is Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is a very famous actor starring in movies like: Forrest Gump, Cast Away, and Big. All these movies are very popular and are all great movies like Toy Story. If you are going to give it a shot it might be because of Tom Hanks acting skills. Tim Allen plays Buzz. He is a very popular actor in movies like Santa Claus and Cars. This movie doesn't just have great actors it also has an amazing soundtrack with a truly unforgettable song You've Got a Friend in Me. There are tons of other songs that will make you wanna sing out loud like Strange Things and I Will Go Sailing No More. All the songs and the cast are never to be forgotten.Toy Story has a lot of themes. One of many I could think of is, friendship which is shown by Buzz and Woody. The change, that I can't tell you about, really shows this. Speaking of change, that is a theme too. Change can sometimes be hard. When Woody first sees Buzz he starts to get jealous and obviously mad, like a kid would get mad when their parents had a baby and it gets all the attention.Toy story will always have a special place in my heart. The movie taught me about friendship and told what change means. I will always think of it as one of the best movies of all time. These lyrics right here show you why this movie is so great, \"Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am. Bigger and stronger too, maybe.

Basically the whole movie is like some siblings fighting for more attention from their parents. In the middle of all this fighting between the two of them, they end up in the hands of the neighbor Sid. He is the kid next door that sabotages and brakes toys for fun. You can see how that is an amazing idea of an antagonist. But when they get taken a lot of things happen is it for the better or worse you will just have to find out.Toy story is a humorous classic, nobody can deny this. Toy Story brings the idea of toys to a whole new level. After watching this movie when I was young I never thought of toys the same. I cared for my toys more and honestly thought that they came to life when I left the room.The humor is great for a kids movie. A lot of the parts where Buzz thinks he is actually a space ranger and he is making fun of Woody always give a nice little chuckle. In one of the scenes Woody is lost from Andy because of Buzz and Woody is screaming at Buzz who still thinks he is a real space ranger and Woody is screaming, \"You're a toy. You're a child's play thing!\" then after that Buzz says,\" You're a sad strange little man, and you have my pity.\" There is also a pretty big change from the beginning of the movie to the end with a great message. I won't spoil the change you'll just have to watch the movie. I will say though, that it might have something to do with one of the themes, friendship.Toy Story has Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the main characters. Woody is Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is a very famous actor starring in movies like: Forrest Gump, Cast Away, and Big. All these movies are very popular and are all great movies like Toy Story. If you are going to give it a shot it might be because of Tom Hanks acting skills. Tim Allen plays Buzz. He is a very popular actor in movies like Santa Claus and Cars. This movie doesn't just have great actors it also has an amazing soundtrack with a truly unforgettable song You've Got a Friend in Me. There are tons of other songs that will make you wanna sing out loud like Strange Things and I Will Go Sailing No More. All the songs and the cast are never to be forgotten.Toy Story has a lot of themes. One of many I could think of is, friendship which is shown by Buzz and Woody. The change, that I can't tell you about, really shows this. Speaking of change, that is a theme too. Change can sometimes be hard. When Woody first sees Buzz he starts to get jealous and obviously mad, like a kid would get mad when their parents had a baby and it gets all the attention.Toy story will always have a special place in my heart. The movie taught me about friendship and told what change means. I will always think of it as one of the best movies of all time. These lyrics right here show you why this movie is so great, \"Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am. Bigger and stronger too, maybe. But none of them will ever love you the way I do.\" Some of the best lyrics to every come from a song.

I can honestly say that Toy Story is as important to animated cinema as Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in that both movies were the first feature length animated productions ever done in their respective mediums: Toy Story being the first computer-animated feature and Snow White being the world's first traditionally-animated feature.Toy Story is as synonymous with cinema as the works of Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Hayao Miyazaki and Chuck Jones: it's a film that shows the best of every world in the imagination. There are toys that embody cowboys, spacemen, wrestlers, dogs, potatoes and figures that resemble the uber-edginess the mid-90s garnered thanks to hit video games like Doom and Mortal Kombat. Toy Story is a film that knows exactly what makes kids movies resonate with adults: having an emotional bridge that's built into the story itself where playtime and wisdom, as the fundamental themes to the film, is symbolic of the concept of people growing up and how that can change the world around you. You can still mature in ways that still keep you young and hopeful at heart even when everything around you is totally unpredictable and volatile.This film is a zeitgeist movie for the 90s and it's still technically very impressive to this very day.

Outside of Pixar's offices, who would've predicted that in 1995, at the at the height of Disney's 2D animated musical resurgence, that the course of animated family films had just been changed forever.And it wasn't just the technology. \"Toy Story\" undoubtedly deserves to be heralded until the end of time for being the first computer-animated feature film, but so many other forces contributed to it becoming the year's box-office champion, chief among them - story.Pixar's first concept exemplifies all the incredible storytelling they've done in the last 20-plus years: What do our toys do when no one is watching? Children's imaginations have infused their toys with life ever since there were toys, and \"Toy Story\" plays out that fantasy for kids while evoking profound nostalgia for the parents.This \"hidden world\" notion, with stories that explore little universes hiding in plain sight, has been Pixar's secret story sauce. Just take a look at the movie's credits to see how that concept influenced future classics: Pixar father (and the film's director) John Lasseter (\"A Bug's Life,\" \"Cars\"), Pete Docter (\"Monsters Inc.,\" \"Up,\" \"Inside Out\") and Andrew Stanton (\"Finding Nemo,\" \"WALL-E\").But even a brilliant concept needs anchoring in real, universal human themes, and that's the real reason Pixar has been the cream of the crop ever since November 22, 1995. In \"Toy Story,\" that boils down to the characters of Woody and Buzz. There's Woody, who has the whole being a toy thing figured out and enjoys his cozy little \"spot\" as Andy's favorite. Then there's Buzz Lightyear, the shiny new novelty who hasn't had the existential realization that he's not a space ranger yet. It's a storyline for these two leads born out of something that happens all the time: kids' tastes change and they're always moving on to the next cool toy. Woody's jealousy and Buzz's naivete are relatable to kids and adults alike.That takes us to the crowning touch on \"Toy Story\" - the voice acting (no, not Randy Newman, but he's crucial to the film's complete aesthetic). Only with the casting of Robin Williams as the Genie in \"Aladdin\" a couple years earlier had there even existed the notion of casting big-name actors in animated films. Even then, like Williams, the name parts were given to comedians in the comic relief roles. Getting Tom Hanks to play the lead role was a total coup, and when \"Toy Story\" made bank, animation studios immediately began putting together cast lists of name actors that could barely fit on a movie poster.Hanks' Woody still deserves to rank as one of the best voice-acting performances. He's the emotional signpost keeping young viewers in tune with how they should feel at each moment (though Buzz's botched flight attempt is the emotional apex of the movie to be sure). Hanks isn't merely lending his voice to the film, he's playing the role of Woody, and it makes all the difference.During my many childhood viewings, \"Toy Story\" always felt like an exhaustive multi-chapter journey, especially once Woody and Buzz leave the confines of Andy's room, so on this revisit it's funny to realize that the film remains Pixar's shortest. That's how much dimension Lasseter and team pack into this movie and a large part of why it endures. Any notion that \"Toy Story\" was a \"cute\" first attempt by a studio that would go on to vastly improve upon it is missing the point. Yes, Pixar would get more visually advanced, build even more intricate worlds and tell even more emotionally deeper stories (and all in the \"Toy Story\" series alone), but all those elements in this film still stand strong on their own. It's a classic, and one that set the bar upon which all those films were left with no choice but to strive for.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Toy Story is one of those revolutionary movies! It's the first full-length computer animated film ever! Toy Story inspired companies to make animated movies in it's style, even Disney, whom was struggling after it's Renaissance in the 90's, was attempting in Pixar's technique. Now Pixar could've just created a mediocre movie, and still get some points for it's technological achievements. But Pixar didn't do that, in fact, they made one of the best animated films ever made. Even though Toy Story isn't a 100% original idea, they made an excellent variation of it and it had it's identity. All of the acting is perfect! Tom Hanks as Sheriff Woody is a perfect casting choice, along with Tim Allen as Buzz, and every single other character. I loved Tom Hanks performance in movies such as Forrest Gump(1996) and The Green Mile(1999) but honestly him as Woody is his most memorable performance, even though he's perfect in those movies also. This film also had some emotional moments, helping Pixar get an identity of having those kind of moments in their movies. The emotional moments are nothing compared to the sequels of Toy Story, but they are definitely good. My only issue is the animation, for it didn't all age too well...especially the humans. This may be the reason why the main characters in the older Pixar movies in particular are animals, creatures, or inanimate objects(referring to toys). Even with it's aged animation, it could surprisingly be better than some animated movies later on...specifically direct to DVD movies like Norm of the North(2016) or Foodfight(2012), which had a budget of 65 million dollars...all of that money was wasted.

The great thing about \"Toy Story\" is that we all have these characters we like. I'm a fan of Mr Potato Head and Rex, and I also like Little Bo Peep and Hamm. And I still think they're all wonderful toys. When it comes to the main characters, I'm personally not a fan of Woody, but I'm a massive fan of Buzz; in fact, I only watch this movie due to Buzz, and it's Buzz who plays the biggest part of this movie.

It should be Buzz who is Andy's 'most' favourite toy followed by Woody and the rest. I know Buzz is one of Andy's newer toys, but he still should've been Andy's best toy. Buzz was the latest edition.

The premise lends itself to a number of perplexing unanswered questions (in particular, regarding the 'rules' that the toys follow to freeze as soon as there is the possibility of a human seeing them move) but if one accepts the basic notion and runs with it, the film offers a surprisingly compelling story with striking personal identity themes as both of the main toys come to realise that they are not as special as they once thought. For Woody, it comes with realising that his owner can have other favourite toys and for Buzz it comes from awakening to the fact that he actually is a toy and not the famous space commander that he is designed as being. The film is blessed by excellent animation effects too; while many entirely computer generated animated films have come out in the years since, few have used the process quite so delightfully with lots of mobile tracking and panning shots that would have been near impossible to get right in a live action feature. The changing facial reactions on the toys (especially Woody) are impressive too - even if the fact that the toys in the film look more realistic than the humans in the film never quite feels right. This is, of course, a film about the toys though, and fanciful as the premise may well be, there is a lot to like about their loyalty both towards their owners and each other."], ["yup", "The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made \u2013 something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.'"], ["Good, but I prefer the second film.", "I have seen this several times before, although apparently I never rated it at IMDb.

If I had, I might have given it a 9 or 10 in previous years, but after watching it again, I'd have to give it an 8. Most of this lowered rating is due to Woody's petulance and jealousy in the first half of the film, although the second half makes up for it.Of course, it IS the first computer-animated film, and ushered in a new era of animation. Still, is that necessarily a good reason for giving it a higher rating? I wouldn't categorize this as my favorite Pixar film by any means, although it's certainly not my least favorite.

Also, whenever I hear him singing, I'm reminded of the Family Guy bit where he basically just sings what he sees.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Ground breaking", "Andy's toys come to life. Woody (Tom Hanks) is his favorite until a new toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) takes over as the new favorite. Woody gets jealous and tries to get rid of Buzz. Only they both get left behind.This was the first successful CGI full length movie. It ushers in PAXAR as a major force in movies. While the groundbreaking CGI is impressive, the characters are what's so charming about the movie. It's a stroke of genius to make the movie about toys. The CGI is still not photo realistic. People would be too hard to make look real. Toys are perfect. And the great voices allow life to be injected into these inanimate toys.

But what makes it one of the best animated films of all time is its seamless blend of sophisticated storytelling with state-of-the-art animation.The screenplay is a gem in itself too for the plot is tightly knitted, makes excellent use of wit & is inhabited by a colourful set of characters who exhibit a stunning level of depth in their respective arcs. Its make-believe world is extremely convincing, the references n homages it makes to earlier classics is tastefully carried out, the relationship between kids & their toys is nailed to perfection and it also manages to convey its themes with effortless finesse.Adding more heart n soul to its characters are the talented voices behind it spearheaded by Tom Hanks & Tim Allen who infuse life into Woody & Buzz Lightyear respectively plus their on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic. Cinematography is expertly carried out, pacing is very brisk for the film never loses momentum & keeps getting better as plot progresses while Randy Newman's music instills an immense feeling of joy, warmth & wonder with its adventurous tracks.And then of course there is the revolutionary 3D animation that marked the dawn of a new era in animation which soon went on to completely re-invent its medium. It may not look as spellbinding today as it did back in 1995 but its influence on film, technology, video games & even computer graphics ever since cannot be understated, nor can be denied the role it played in the rise of new animation studios which ultimately put its medium in the same league that other genres have enjoyed since long.On an overall scale, Toy Story is a magical blend of kinetic direction, smart screenplay, rich characters, ideal voice cast, dynamic camera-work, terrific editing & heartwarming score that's freshly envisioned, ingeniously composed & gorgeously animated. A masterwork of jaw-dropping quality refined to perfection that triumphs in all aspects, Toy Story marks a significant moment in cinema for it marks the arrival of what would later become arguably the most acclaimed as well as critically & commercially excelling film studio of our time."], ["A nostalgic start to Pixar's best film franchise", "I very fondly remember watching this film as a child and to this day it it still one of Pixar's finest efforts, especially if it's their first feature-length animation.As for the animation, it is pretty impressive for 1995 and the most realistically-modelled toys are Etch-A-Sketch and Mr Potato Head, although the main toys Woody and Buzz are well-designed as well. There are some funny moments such as Mr Potato Head pretending to be a Picasso painting and Sid's sister Hannah dressing Buzz up as a woman and naming him Mrs Nesbitt at a tea party as well as some dark, sinister moments such as Sid making mutant toys that eventually scare him off and the tense moment of Woody and Buzz's rivalry including the memorable, \"You are a toy!\" line. Other lines I remember from this film are Buzz's catchphrase \"To infinity and beyond\" and Woody's many phrases such as \"You're my favourite deputy\" and \"There's a snake in my boots\" to name just two. The opening scene involving Andy playing with Woody accompanied by Randy Newman's 'You've Got A Friend In Me' is one of the film's most captivating parts and I liked the product placement of toy manufacturers (Rex being made by Mattel and Mr Potato Head being made by Playskool).Overall, this is a dark and funny start to my favourite trilogy of animated films. 10/10."], ["Reminds me of my childhood", "I watched Toy story when I was little and it was my favorite childhood movie and I really love it because it made me think a lot and when I was little I used to tip toe up the steps and down the hall and peek into my room to see if my toys were moving but they never were but I just thought they were really good and I used to talk to them all the time about my life which you will most likely think I'm weird because I talked to my toys but I talked to my dog to and you want to know why well because I love to talked and everybody was annoyed so I just talked to my stuff.

It was released on the back of the critically acclaimed (and box office hits): Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Because of this (and Toy Story being Disney's first collaboration with Pixar), there must have been considerable pressure on the picture to succeed. The idea of toys coming to life is a seemingly sure-fire winner for a family film. However, this could easily have been handled badly. This is not the case with Toy Story.The pioneering animation, brilliantly written script, top notch voice performances, and shrewd direction make this a timeless animated film.Much has been said about the groundbreaking Pixar computer animation. This is understandable and justified. The visualisation of the story world is inventive and innovative. The quality of the animation enables the audience to capture the essence of the world and fully immerse themselves within it.The film's script is incredibly tight. It is witty and exhilarating; whilst containing heart and drive in abundance. I would go as far as to say that this film has the best script out of the three Toy Story films (which is no mean feat).The script is also effective in its use of characterisation, and it is especially prevalent with Woody. He's certainly not your archetypal Disney hero, but that's why he (and the film) works so well. He can be petulant, prone to jealousy and mood swings, insecure, and devious. These reasons (and others) are why Woody is loved; he has human qualities. He has his flaws, but he has a good heart.The voice actors are exceptional in bringing the script to life. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen shine in their leading roles as Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast are also highly effective in their performances. A notable example would be Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head; he gets a fair share of the film's laughs (especially from the adult proportion of the audience).Much of this would not have been possible without a safe pair of hands in charge of bringing all of these elements together. John Lasseter's directing expertise is there for all to see with his handling of this picture.There are also some stand out moments from the film that solidify its stature. They are directly linked with the two backbones of the picture; Woody and Buzz. The 'Strange Things' sequence in which Woody watches his whole world fall apart before him (as Buzz takes over Andy's room) is beautifully shot and realised. The other stand out moment is when Buzz watches his perceived world (and sense of self) revealed to be false as he stares in disbelief at the Buzz Lightyear TV advertisement. His subsequent attempt to fly out of the window is, once again, exquisitely shot and ethereal. Another consistent ingredient between these two moments is the poignant and perfectly suited music by Randy Newman.Toy Story is a film that seamlessly brings together the many aspects that make a great film. It possesses a strong premise and story, great characters, awesome visuals, and a great soundtrack. It is certainly no surprise that the film has gone on to influence many other computer animation features; whilst also being responsible for kick-starting one of the greatest trilogies in American cinema."], ["Toy Story \u2014 An incomparable animation about toys' secret life", "Toy Story, the first of the series, was a spectacular achievement. Not only was it completely rendered digitally, the quality was very high to equal or better most standard animation, but it was actually excellent fun. On top of that, you had the novel idea of a toy's secret life, a great story, awesome voice acting, lots of jokes, a bit of drama, some suspense, real life conflicts of personality, solid dialogs, and some heroics, all of which resulted in a complete package that anyone of any age can appreciate.The cast distribution was done smartly, each actor corresponding perfectly to their characters. The soundtrack was discreet and avoided a big sing along, which is a blessing.The only thing that could be thought of as negative was the technology limitation at the time. The colors are a bit stiff, lacking a bit of shadowing and lighting, but it's really minimal, certainly not enough to distract from this quality piece.I highly recommend it unless you're not interested in animation at all."], ["The movie that changed all animations that were to come", "Even though there were other animation classics such as Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, no other animation movie, prior to this, had being a 3D Computer Animated Film making this one of the most ground-breaking films of all time.This movie is also unique in every sense. Even though the movie is targeted for children and is the movie that every single child watches during their child hood, its so good that even adults absolutely love it.The film follows the tale of Andy's toys who are, unknown to all humans, actually alive. During the movie, as Buzz, Andy's new toy comes, Sheriff Woody becomes jealous of Buzz as he becomes Andy's new favorite and attempts to put an end to it but Buzz gets his revenge. However, the two get captured by Sid, the evil kid next door that enjoys torturing toys and must try their best to escape. To be fair, this movie is one of the shortest films I've ever seen but also one of the most enjoyable.The voice acting for the film is just masterful. Tom Hanks voice acting of Woody is just brilliant and Tim Allen as Buzz was brilliant. The voice acting just added further strength to every aspect of the film.The animations for a 1995 film, being the first 3D animated film, is just visually amazing! Though it may not stand out against recent visual animations, this movie is just a joy to watch, even after 18 years!One thing that is incredibly cool is that they don't explain how exactly the toys ever were alive and its great to see such thing left anonymous. I also found the characters extremely entertaining and the way that Buzz and Woody become friends during the film is just well made!Also, having your main characters toys and in fact making a movie entirely based on toys can be some pain and something which people just laugh at but in this film, we as an audience are emotionally connected to these plastic toys! Its because, despite being toys, the director portrays these as human like things which makes it extremely interesting to us.The dialogue in the film is great and as a result it constantly made me laugh. I loved that little kid as a villain. I thought he was fascinating and I'm glad that very little time is spent about Andy.Despite being made for children all adults are sure to have a blast with this film. In fact, I don't see why nobody has yet to see this film. In case you haven't, be sure to remember that this film changed all animation films to come and that this is surely one of Pixar's ever most finest films!"], ["Nothing steps to this... Disney/ Pixar's first", "Every child dreams of his toys coming to life and playing back, but the main idea has always been what it will be like if toys did come to life. Well Toy Story answered that question in a more enlighten way that made you eager to see more of the adventures Andy's toys were getting into. Toy Story has a masterpiece storyline that makes you just sit and wonder, the screenplay that blends this toy acts to human interaction is so well done, that if not that the fact that this can't be true, this movie may make kids think this is possible.The movie is about a group of toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present and come to life to discuss, when humans are not around. The toys behavior, actions and fears are all based on their need to be played with by their owner.This group of toys belong to a boy named Andy, and the Andy's favorite toy is Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), a cowboy dull. Things were rosy when Woody was on top, but then came a new toy who took Woody's place Buzz (Tim Allen). Now Woody who feels threatened tries to get back at Buzz but he drags himself down with his acts, and now he may never see Andy again.Toy Story was the first fully computer animated feature film at its time and it came about when Disney approached Pixar to produce a computer animated feature for them after seeing their short animated film Tin Toy (1988). The production of this movie went through many ups and downs, mostly due to the fact that Disney wanted a story that was nail biting and out of this world perfect, which caused Pixar to work on re-writes that saw the lead characters changing form till they finally settled on Woody the wise leader of the Toys in Andy's room and Buzz the new addition to Andy's toys who is confused as to who he really is.Then there was the talk between Pixar and Disney about songs. Disney's movies at that time were all musicals with the characters breaking into songs, to further pass their message along, but John Lasseter didn't want that at all claiming this is a buddy film, so the two reached a compromise, that the score of the movie will be directed towards the action at hand at the point. That can be seen in the movie at one point when Buzz wanted to fly out the window to prove that he could fly and that he was not a \"Toy\". The song that was playing during that scene of Buzz trying to fly had such lyrics as: ...no, it can't be true, I can fly if I wanted to.Toy Story received massive recognition during its time Review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes has the movie at a 100% approval rating from critics and it also won Three Academy Awards (for Best Original Song, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay).The movie was a financial success, and it gave birth to two other sequels which were bigger financial success Toy Story 2 (released in 1999 and gaining 100% approval at Rotten Tomatoes) and Toy story 3 (released in 2010 and gaining 99% approval at Rotten Tomatoes and it is the highest grossing animation till date making over 1 billion dollars). There was also a direct-to-video animated film titled Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins (about Buzz) and also an animated television series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.Toy Story is a classic true and true one DVD you should own.www.lagsreviews.com"], ["Instant Classic", "Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever.Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge.One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little clich\u00e9, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real \"space ranger.\" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous \"laser\" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a \"cool toy.\" He is \"Andy's toy.\" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship.We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who \"terrorizes toys, just for fun.\" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film.Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies."], ["A fantastic start to the animation world", "In 1995, viewers were treated to the visually stunning Toy Story.

A few years after the year 2000 is when the general public began favoring CGI films a lot more.Personally, I still like traditional animated films because they provide a more storybook-like picture.

The film was the first feature film by Pixar and created solely by CGI. Toy Story is a film about a six year old boy named Andy, and his love of toys. Unbeknownst to Andy, his toys actually talk and communicate with each other.Woody, who is voiced by Tom Hanks, is a cowboy doll with a pull string that allows him to speak a few select phrases. He considers himself to be the leader of all the other toys and Andy's favorite. When Andy has a birthday, he is given a new toy-a Buzz Lightyear action figure-that makes Woody feel very threatened. Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, is Andy's new toy and this makes Woody very fearful of ending up in the garage sale box with all the other old and broken toys. A series of mishaps occur between Buzz and Woody throughout the film causing even more tension and frustration between them. When they are captured by a little boy named Sid, who likes to torture and destroy toys, Buzz and Woody have to put aside their differences with each other and work together to be reunited with Andy.I believe this film's main theme is about coming together despite our differences and working alongside of each other rather than against each other. Despite Woody's jealousy and insecurities he starts to form a bond with Buzz the more he really gets to know him. By forming this bond, it unites all the toys thus making them strong enough to accomplish great feats they normally wouldn't be able to do on their own. This theme is even more apparent with Buzz Lightyear's infamous saying \"To infinity and beyond!\" which implies that nothing is impossible when you have the help of friends. Ultimately, Buzz and Woody realize that nothing is as bad as it seems as long as they have each other.Through the use of CGI, there is a realness factor that before the use of CGI, most animated films could not produce. The realistic graphics transport the viewer into the movie making them feel like a part of each characters' journey. There are lighting effects to emphasize certain emotions the director wants the viewer to feel. While the toys are united in Andy's bedroom everything is bright and colorful. When the toys are divided or separated from each other and Andy, the scenes are dim and dull. The amount of detail that went into each character's facial expressions was flawless. There is plenty of action, to keep young viewers entertained and there is wonderful dialog between the characters to keep the older viewers nostalgic by the wonderfully written story.Toy Story is a revolutionary film in its own right. It set the path for the way audiences watch animated films. Toy Story is a heartwarming family film with a wonderful story about acceptance, teamwork, determination, and how powerful the love from a child can be. I highly recommend watching this film."], ["\"Watch out for green little men!\"", "A cowboy toy is profoundly threatened and jealous when a fancy spaceman toy supplants him as top toy in a boy's room.As Pixar's projects nowadays are simply beautiful, back in 1995 they came up with the most imaginative project yet. Toy Story not only produced the technology that is now used now, it combines heart and hilarity. Of course, including all Pixar films, there is always something for the adults too. A lurking message in the background depicts friendship in the most heartwarming way. As this is so called a childhood memory in my mind, there is SO much memorable scenes that I can actually play in my mind! Example: The Pizza Planet scene, escaping Sid's house, or some of the heartwarming ones: Buzz realizing he is just a toy, Woody's jealously. The voice acting, especially realizing it was made it 1995, is amazing! Magically, it feels as if they are actual actors saying their lines. The score is beautiful and especially the main theme: \"You've Gotta Friend In Me.\" The overall feeling while watching this masterpiece is brilliant and magical; only something Pixar could achieve. Although being possibly Pixar's best work, keep in mind that there are two sequels. Pixar has most possibly created one of the best trilogies. This reaching peaks of \"Lord of the Rings\" or \"The Godfather.\" While you may laugh at that, watch it with an open mind and an open heart.

Not only is it the beginning of Pixar's dominance, it is an incredible landmark for it's time that has a multi generational impact in imagination. The only flaw is the fact that the animation is dated back to 1995, which back then it was incredible. Nevertheless a classic animated movie. The buddy dynamic between Woody and Buzz is hilarious, being that it's the veteran vs. rookie, grandfather vs. young toy, and Cowboy vs. Astronaut.

Some of the toys are Woody the western sheriff played by Tom Hanks, Buzz Lightyear played by Tim Allen, Mr. Potato head played by Don Rickles, Slinky Dog, Rex the dinosaur, and Bo Peep. The main characters are Andy, Sid (the mean kid next door), and Andy's mom. Andy's favorite toy and best friend is Woody. Woody is a sheriff from the Wild West and he and Andy are best friends. These two do everything together, but when Andy is not around, the toys come to life. Woody believes that he has the greatest life a toy could ever have; until, Andy's birthday party. This is where we meet Buzz light year the super hero that saves the galaxy from evil. Woody has a brief flash of jealousy when he realizes how much attention Buzz is getting, so he tries to set Buzz up and it goes all wrong. Buzz falls out the window onto Sid's property and this starts the beginning of Woody's quest to get buzz back and redeem himself with the other toys. The overall theme or message of the story is friendship. You got a friend in me, written by Randy Newman and performed by Tom Scott, is the theme song for Toy Story and encompass the exact message the creators of this film were going for. This holds true for movies like The Fox and the Hound and Milo and Otis. These movies take us on adventures where strength courage and friendship are prevalent and felt throughout the entire film. The director in this film used many different techniques to get the viewer to feel what he characters were feeling, he also used techniques to establish the theme throughout the film without over killing the message. One of the techniques Lasetter used was motifs of friendship. For instance, Woody struggles with trying to get Buzz to understand that he is a toy and not a real space ranger because he cares about Buzz's feelings. During this time they get lost, they are at odds because Woody knocked Buzz out the window and throughout all of this, they work together to find a way to get home to their favorite pal Andy. Every scene in the film displays examples of friendship, and I think they did a great job of showing the audience the importance of this simple act of humanity that we as people tend to forget. Although it was a children's movie this film was sure to impact the adults as well."], ["Greatest animation film ever", "Toy Story was the first full-length children's feature made entirely with computer-generated animation, and it was released in 1995. This film has an amazing plot, with great characters and actress which makes Toy Story the greatest animation film ever. Toy story is a buddy movie/adventure tale with an understated lesson about the value of friendship. \"You can count on me!\" Toy Story was about two toys, an old, beloved cowboy named woody (voice of Tom Hanks) and new beloved space ranger, named Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Both of these toys try and compete for the love of the human boy named Andy Davis (voice of John Morris) who plays with them, not knowing that they come alive when he lives the room. Toy Story takes place in Andy's bedroom where Woody is always placed on the bed and the rest of the toys are placed in the chest or on the shelves. One day the toys found out that Andy was having a birthday party and became scared that they might be replaced with newer toys. Woody the leader of the toys, calms the other toys down and sends a team of toy soldiers down stairs to scope out the new coming toys. As Andy is opening his gifts the most alarming arrival was brought to the scene when the new comer Buzz Lightyear was opened. Andy fell in love with Buzz Lightyear and ran up stairs and threw Woody off of the bed and replaced Buzz Lightyear in Woody's place. In the first half of the movie Woody and Buzz didn't get along and fought for the love of Andy and the other toys. As the plot takes a different direction when the family decides to move, Woody and Buzz find themselves stuck at the gas station with no idea on how to get home. This is where the theme of friendship takes over in the film. As Woody and Buzz starts to work together to find their way home Sin, Andy's next door neighbor picks them up. As the toys are placed in Sin's room they see Sin feed other toys to his dog. This is when Woody and Buzz join forces and try to escape the house before Sin feeds them to his the dog. Toy Story remains me of Avatar with the use of the computer- generated imagery. Like Toy Story, Avatar brought the characters to life with the use of all the different colors schemes, lighting and angles. Both of these films characters looked very human like and real and both won rewards for their use of animation."], ["Toy Story (1995 film)", "One of the most popular computer-animated films released in 1995, Toy Story takes place in the bedroom of a little boy named Andy Davis. With no human around all the toys in Andy's room come alive. One week prior to Andy's birthday the toys discover the newest addition which is a astronaut action figure named Buzz Lightyear. As the family is about to go to Pizza Planet to celebrate, Andy's pull-string toy Woody becomes jealous of Buzz and begin fighting as a result they accidentally knock themselves out the car window. As the car drives off, Woody and Buzz attempt to get back to Andy by way of a Planet Pizza delivery truck. This is where the journey begins as both Woody and Buzz undertake a plethora of dangerous obstacles such as the spaceship-shaped claw game machine, a nightmarish neighbor named Sid with Scud his voracious dog that takes pleasure in torturing toys. As Woody, the pull-string cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear, the astronaut action figure, soon learn to respect each other's differences and as a result of their adventure to Andy they become close friends.By the time Woody and Buzz finally make it to Andy, the family has packed the moving truck and is about to drive away when the two toys use a daring stunt to catapult themselves into the family's car with almost perfect precision. Next the narrative shows the Davis family on Christmas Eve. As the movie comes to a close Andy's toys are shown organizing a mission to discover the new editions named Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head and a surprise arrival of a puppy. The movie ends with Woody and Buzz showing a look of concern on their faces in reference to the family's new puppy.As the sequel to Toy Story, the film Toy Story 2 continues the pattern of the original film in which Andy's toys organize a reconnaissance mission to save Woody from an international toy dealer. In this movie the producers utilized the same computer-animated style that allowed audiences to view the toy characters in this film as real people. Though various computer generated scenes were to develop this film, two techniques such as angle and lighting were specifically needed to create life-like scenery and characters throughout the film. For example diverse lighting methods were necessary in order to help viewers decipher the mood of a particular scene or event. This can be seen as the family goes to Pizza Planet in which the claw game machine stands out from all the surrounding games due to its bright colors in dark game room.Film angles were also used throughout the Toy Story film, for example when traveling in the Planet Pizza truck the two toys met up with three toy aliens hanging from the truck's rear view mirror. In this scene Woody and Buzz were viewing the aliens from an angle in which they appeared to be descending from the sky. In my opinion this was yet another example connected to the theme in which both Woody and Buzz had to overcome their prejudices and accept the differences of others in order to achieve a common goal. In my opinion lighting and angles were a significant part of the film's theme which is about how two toys, Woody and Buzz, were able to overlook each other's differences in order to achieve the common goal of safely getting back to their kid owner Andy. In the end this film did an excellent job at portraying computer- animated toys such as Woody and Buzz Lightyear in a humanized manner. Wonderful family movie!"], ["Cute Family Movie", "Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men.The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled \"You've Got a Friend in Me\". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences.Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them.Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship."], ["Where it all begins...", "Pixar strikes out in feature films with its first full-lengther, and the results are stunning! They set the bar almost impossibly high for anyone else interested in getting into full length computer animation. But what made Toy Story have such staying power and make the characters immediately house-hold names wasn't so much the technical brilliance (although it did dazzle), but the storytelling. Okay, case in point. Independence Day. The media hyped this up and it got a lot of viewers. It had a lot of effects. It dazzled our eyes (not our hearts) on the big screen. It sold a lot of DVDs. It made a lot of money...during its run. So who remembers it much now? For that matter, who will remember much of just about any of Roland Emmerich's films years from now? But who can forget Woody, Andy, Buzz, etc.? Who can forget that bedroom? Who can forget Sid? The writers at Pixar took a great idea which was understanding how many of us (even as adults) have emotional attachments to our toys and found a way to bring the heart of that idea and nail it down to a heartwarming story about friendship. That the technical details are flat out amazing for its time was an added bonus (even seeing reflections from Buzz's space helmet -- they didn't have to do that! The animators threw that in just to make the experience all the more special and believable). No other studio has ever come up to the standard set by Pixar. Dreamworks hasn't, though they have made a good film or 2. Sony Pics hasn't, etc. etc. Because they lack a great story to begin with, and when they do land upon one, they muck it up by trying to make it something it isn't. I can almost hear the writers in their studios thinking, \"Well, this is good, but we need to add more adult jokes so that the parent's won't get bored.\" Advice, just follow Pixar's example and let the story unfold as it needs to. Pixar got it right and has gotten it right up through Toy Story 3. I fear we may be in for a nadir of creativity as we move into Cars 2, but we'll see..."], ["Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie", "I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about.Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys.The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys.Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film."], ["\"You are a cool toy\"!", "With films like \"Toy Story\", I feel like I'm going out of my movie comfort zone somewhat, but then on the flip side, I think I'd like to be a kid forever. At least in spirit. You know, like the seniors in the old age home in the Twilight Zone episode 'Kick the Can'. There's a lot to like about this picture; part of it's the cool animation and creative voicing, part of it's the clever use of sight gags that young kids would have no idea about, like the Binford Tool Box and the Punisher logo on Sid's shirt. I guess it's good to be old enough to have that perspective.With only nominal appearances by the 'humans' in the movie, the picture stayed true to it's mission of presenting Andy's toys as if they were living and thinking creatures. They had their own favorites, showed emotion, and helped teach the lesson of having a friend by being a friend. When things looked bleak in Sid's back yard, the misfit toys even managed to violate their own prime directive, that is, they allowed Sid to see they were 'real' in order to help Woody and Buzz. I wonder if Sid ever got over it.I read a dozen or so of the other comments on the picture and no one mentioned Randy Newman in their reviews. I'm sure someone did, but let me add my voice to that minority. \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" is a perfect accompaniment to the picture, and fits it like a glove.

I haven't seen it in many years, but I remembered most of the scenes if not the exact detail and execution, and of course with an older eye I have a better appreciation for what's going on.This is just about as good of a \"first computer animated film\" as could be hoped for. One thing I can say is that the humor, while not sophisticated or adult, is more intelligent than I remembered. It's a movie designed for a young audience, but the writers realized that as many adults will be watching its debut for the spectacle of computer animation, and it's clever for this group in a way that would fly over their children's' heads.The plot line is simpler than I recalled, which is to be expected. One thing that surprised me is the relative one-dimensionality of the characters, especially when compared to Toy Story 2, which has been my mental standard for the characters for many years, and Toy Story 3. Woody is jealous but devoted, Buzz is delusional, Slinky is loyal, Mr. Potato Head is suspicious, etc. These aren't characters so much as they're adjectives. However, the voice actors do an all-around great job. I may just be saying that because I've known who Woody and Buzz are long before I knew who Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were. Ultimately, the simplicity of the characters matches the concise nature of the film.In fact, having watched this again the best way I can think of to describe this movie is that it's basically a really long short film. Which is not at all to say that its plot is artificially stretched; quite the contrary. It's lean and compact like a short film is, it just happens to not be short.All in all, watching this film again has lead me to believe that Toy Story 2 is underrated. Toy Story's sequel is understood by many to be an action-packed film appealing almost exclusively to kids, but that film was where some of the more mature themes that would be brought to their logical conclusion in Toy Story 3 first appeared. In addition, many of the characters, particularly Buzz, aren't nearly as fleshed out until the second one. Toy Story is a cartoon, but Toy Story 2 is an animated film, and that is the difference.That said, this movie holds up very well and I will always hold it close to my heart. There are rarely more joyous moments in film than \"falling with style"], ["The start of something big", "Nowadays people assume that when it comes to what they see up on the big screen computers make absolutely anything possible. If you can dream it you can see it with the assistance of a little computer wizardry. But of course that was not always the case. The computer animation revolution had to start somewhere and that somewhere was Toy Story. The animators at Pixar made the impossible possible. You watch the movie today and it's easy to take it for granted. You forget that Pixar was attempting something entirely new and that there were more than a few doubts as to whether it would work. Oh, it worked alright. It worked spectacularly. Director John Lasseter and his animation team created a visually stunning masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. Movie animation would never be the same, Toy Story changed everything.The movie looks great but in order to be deemed a success there had to be a story to match the visuals. All the technological wizardry in the world would not have been able to hide a lousy story. Thankfully that proved to be no concern as we get a compelling and endearing storyline, one which provides plenty of opportunities for some good laughs as well. For as revolutionary as the animation was it is the story and the characters which ultimately make the movie so beloved. To infinity and beyond! Just saying it brings a smile to your face. The toys which are the stars of this story are great, memorable characters. Each is infused with its own unique personality. You can dismiss no toy as \"just a toy\". Each toy has its own story, its own life. All the voice actors deserve great credit for the work they did in making each toy stand out in its own way. Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear are of course the big stars and they both fit their roles perfectly. But whether playing a dog, a pig or a potato head each voice actor was uniformly terrific. R. Lee Ermey as a little green army man and Wallace Shawn as a Tyrannosaurus with serious anxiety issues are two personal favorites. So many characters which are so easy to embrace and each of whom is good for some laughs too. And there's even room for a great villain in Sid, the evil toy-destroying kid next door. A great cast of characters brought brilliantly to life by the great work of the animators and the voice cast.Toy Story triumphs in making you feel for its characters. Who can't empathize with Woody as he fears being pushed aside by Buzz? Who hasn't had insecurities like Rex? Who can't understand Mr. Potato Head's longing for a Mrs. Potato Head? When the toys hurt you hurt, when they triumph you feel as if you shared in it. It's a movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face. If there's any complaint it might be that the movie, at a trim 80 minutes, isn't long enough. We want to spend more time with these toys. Of course we would get the opportunity to do so in sequels to come. But the original movie certainly stands on its own merits. It's a movie you can happily watch again and again. And when you do take the time to really look at the world the animation team created for these toys to inhabit. The level of detail in the backgrounds is just as stunning as the beautifully rendered main characters. No corners were cut in creating a world which looks truly lived in. A whole world magically brought to life. Toy Story was, in its time, unlike anything anyone had ever seen. And all these years later the magic is still there. It's a movie which will be discovered, and loved, by generations to come."], ["Pixar First Feature is an Instant Classic", "Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys.The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bank\u0085each with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world.I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about.

Its energy unmistakable; its inspiration unequalled and its charm unmatched, in what is a milestone in animation for reasons much more than the fact the computer generated imagery was as fresh as it was. Vaugely, the memory of seeing it for the first time many years ago stands in rather stark comparison to whatever I recall of the rest of that viewing when it was revealed Toy Story was to be, quite literally, about the toys and their coming to life so as to interact and engage with their surroundings. In starting in the manner it does, with a young boy named Andy animating his toys to as to bring them to life and interact with what's around them as it ran on whatever meek story he could come up with and not knowing a thing about the premise or indeed content, ignorantly, I led myself into believing the entire piece would be of this ilk; quite literally, a toy story about toys being what they are: inanimate objects being interacted with by a child. Imagine the sense of surprise mixed with awe and glee when Woody sits up in Andy's room and announces that \"the coast is clear!\" to the rest of the toys.The film starts like one of those short cartoons you'd see before the beginning of a feature film, years ago. The opening is a diverting mini-narrative involving each of the main characters going through whatever motions a child can muster; the lead toy of whom is Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll which is promptly taken downstairs and around the house as it's emphasised he is Andy's favourite, and has been for a while. I suppose what happens when they come alive might be read into as a deconstruction of these toys; that they are, indeed, so much more than just inanimate objects whom don't think nor feel, each of them coming alive once the humans have vacated then operating within said space; maintaining relationships and feeling an array of emotions such as fear, angst and lust. Some are friendlier than others; some more confident and some have certain elevated relationships with each other. Amongst them, Don Rickles' Potato Head doll; a wonderful creation of physical comedy whose detachable body parts are the source of persistently funny jokes. He's joined by a Slinky Dog (Varney); a green plastic dinosaur Rex (Shawn) and, curiously, Andy's piggy bank Hamm (Ratzenberger).Interestingly, Andy's toys seem infused by true-to-life western iconographic imagery, or are indeed representative of 'type' in their attitudes. Rex is a dinosaur, thus feels the need to be able to scare people with his 'roar' for reasons that must be linked to the fact T-Rex dinosaurs from billions of years ago did exactly this. Somehow, Rex is aware of this. Likewise Andy's small toy soldiers, led by a sergeant voiced by R. Lee Ermey, are as militarian as you'd expect but is there a written rule that says they must show expertise in special ops and must behave in the military manner they do? Remember those grey plastic soldiers of similar size you could get? I guess they'd be equally militarily efficient but could speak in a German accent. I had some yellow soldiers of similar size once; God only knows how they'd sound. There can be no surprise that the toys of Syd (von Detten) cannot speak, due to their forced hybridising with other toys under said child's tortuous regime which sees heads and bodies swapped with other toys thus falsifying their image.It can be no coincidence the two principal toy characters of the film are the two that most resemble human beings in their appearance, with Andy's other toys marginalised due to their animistic or unnatural characteristics. Woody's perfect existence is thrown into disarray by Buzz Lightyear (Allen), a spaceman toy Andy gets on his birthday; the revealing of the gift at the end of the present opening session starting this huge build up as to what Buzz is. Buzz's presence is an example of an item of a more futuristic; more science-fiction orientated nature coming into the house and taking over as older items are rendered more obsolete and therefore replaced thus rendering the issue one of a modernity driven nature, and is an item Toy Story 2 explored much more broadly in terms of genre replacing genre when toys of Woody's ilk are rendered nothing but mere museum pieces. But it is additionally representative of America's obsession with consumerism, in that I've no doubt Buzz is a part of a kind of franchise and Andy's gradual replacing of Woody posters/merchandise etc. This, as he and his mother occupy this blissfully suburban infused street which is systematic of the nation's own attitudes towards mass produced products.Woody and Buzz's overall ultimatum is issued to us, out loud, by Woody when they are stranded at a petrol station: Andy's due to move house shortly and both need to get home, so a lot is at stake and tension runs persistently high. Buzz's own tale of realisation is effortlessly inter-cut with this plight, along the way learning of a new existence and garnering a new lease of life as their relationship feeds off a rather Hollywoodised 'buddy' combination no doubt inspired by American films of the 1980s through to the early 1990s of this ilk. Apart from pioneering your now token 'chase' finale, of which encompasses all the elements and is seen nearer the end of mostly every CG animated film made since (see 2002's Monsters Inc. or 2009's Up), Toy Story is a wonderfully made, supremely nourishing film that opens our eyes to a whole new world within our own and enthrals and entertains in equal measure."], ["The Magic Starts Here,", "Toy Story is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding voice cast. It is complete harmless fun from start to finish, as we follow a group of toys that come to life when the owners are not around. All the characters are very well established, Woody is very layered with great depth and there is great development put in to Buzz Lightyear over the course of the film.The humour in the film is terrific, a great balance between what children and what adults will find funny. It is clear that Pixar tried very hard to ensure this would be a movie that the entire family, people of all ages, can watch and enjoy.The cast is phenomenal, Tom Hanks shines as Woody and truly embodies the emotions the character is undergoing. Tim Allen is also terrific as Buzz Lightyear and conveys the characters realisation of his reality brilliantly throughout, other highlights for me would be Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm.It is a feel good movie and you will find it hard not to wipe the smile off your face from start to finish. Funny, sweet and well animated, Toy Story is fun for the whole family.When Andy gets a new toy for his birthday, his favorite toy, Woody, grows jealous as he feels he's getting replaced."], ["Exciting move!", "This move is very exciting and heartwarming story.

Although there were others creating animated feature length films, Disney has always been a household name, known for their experience and ability to create an emotional and entertaining experience out of hand-drawn images, and original, composed music. In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story. While it wasn't the first time that we've seen CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery, it was the first fully CGI film.What a disaster this film could have been. And thank God that it wasn't. If it was, then it would have done more damage to CGI animation than otherwise. The film was distributed by Disney, but created by Pixar. It had no musicals. No frames were hand drawn, everything was done by computer. It had a lot to live up to. Sticking the Disney name on the film meant that audiences expected not a single drop of mediocrity out of it. Thankfully, as we all know, Toy Story was a success.The animation in the film isn't the augmented reality kind. CGI effects aren't added to real life shots, everything is animated. This gives the film some room to breathe. The lighting, surfaces and other effects all look good, in their own context. It would have been a huge step backwards for computer animation if Toy Story didn't come together so well, and successfully put up that fourth wall.But besides the animation, what brings to film to life is the voice- acting, story, and presentation. It's a story about toys who are conscious and self-aware. However, they all follow a strict code, where they do not allow humans to know of their life and intelligence. It's not an epic tale. Two toys are lost and have to get back home. But what carries the film are the characters. Every toy has a distinct personality, and the voice actors are great in their roles. This is one of the strong points in Toy Story.The film's presentation is great, too. It went totally contradictory of what Disney means to people. There are no musicals, but the music, although used sparingly, has a great effect nonetheless. The direction is of the more typical Hollywood style, and different from the typical Disney movie. It is entertaining to exist in the toys' world, and when they venture off a couple of blocks, you feel like you have traveled a long distance.Toy Story could have been such a disaster. If it wasn't for everything coming together so well, especially the animation, characters and voice acting, computer animation would have taken a step backwards. Its greatest strength are the toys. They are amongst the better characters in film. Toy Story not only proved that animated films can be done in a different formula than the already great Disney one, but that computer animation was here to stay. It was a pleasure to the eyes, and a pleasure to the Andy inside all of us."], ["My 900th review...perhaps the most amazing piece of animation in history....", "I think it is a pretty common conception that Toy Story revolutionized animation. Pixar's first release jump started the animation craze that has lasted nearly two decades and still going strong and gave birth to some of the biggest films of the last 15 years. So it should have been an easy choice for my 900th review with Toy Story craze back on with the new and equally as amazing third installment. Toy Story brings to life some of the greatest characters in film history. You will fall in love with all the characters within the first 15 minutes and makes every step of their fantastical adventure even more captivating. The adventure they go on when you look at it from a truth standpoint is no more than 'down the street' and back but when you're a 3-6 inch toy that changes everything and that is truly the brilliance of Toy Story. You will become one of these toys, their world is so real to you and you see everything from their perspective. Every single person on the planet had toys of one kind of another whether it be a stuffed teddy or a stick and watching Toy Story will make you fondly remember your childhood and look at every inanimate object we love in a different light.Tom Hanks is Woody. No one could ever take that away from him as is the case with many of the toys. Hanks is the soul of the good hearted, compassionate and brave toy cowboy. His voice is so incredibly animated and excited and just absolutely perfect. Tim Allen is as good as Hanks playing the role of everyone's favourite space toy Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry the film makers create between Buzz and Woody is phenomenal and probably one of the biggest reasons Toy Story remains so successful. If I could spend time on each and every voice actor in this film I would because this is without a doubt thee BEST voice acting cast in animation history. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (my personal favourite Rex), John Ratzenberger (simply amazing), and to a lesser extent but still amazing Annie Potts, John Morris (who was Andy in all three films spanning 15 years), Laurie Metcalf and the incredibly versatile character actor R. Lee Ermey. This entire cast created animation history. You will not find a better cast and considering they are all behind the scenes voicing fictional characters that is impressive.Director John Lasseter is not new to animation although Toy Story will certainly be considered his piece de resistance for certain. He has worked in various capacity on dozens of amazing Disney features but he obviously knows his characters, he obviously knows Disney and he obviously is in touch with the little child inside himself and all of us. Best of all Toy Story holds no punches. I would even hesitate to allow my young, young children to see the film before they were ready because there is truly some terrifying scenes in the film and some really creepy characters. Sid and his torturing of toys, and his rag tag band of creepy toy outcasts are downright creepy and make the story even more incredibly but could certainly creep out little children but the happy ending and the bright world of Andy's room and knowing that the Toys will win in the end brings everything together. If you hate cartoons, if you have never seen Toy Story you are short changing yourself because this film will make you realize animation is not your grand daddy's cartoons anymore. A brilliant amazing film that is probably one of the best ever made. 10/10THANKS FOR STICKING WITH ME THROUGH 900 REVIEWS AND ON TO 1000!! 901 and 902 WILL BE TOY STORY 2 AND 3 RESPECTIVELY. Read on!!"], ["Toy Story was the first feature-length film animated entirely by computer.", "It's a deceptively simple story 'peopled' with charming, funny, and well-realised characters and highly enjoyable fare for anyone who ever owned a toy. A toy astronaut (Tim Allen) refuses to accept that he is simply a plaything and becomes the favourite of a small boy - which makes his previous preferred toy (Tom Hanks), a cowboy, deeply jealous.Toy Story is a sensational animated feature, a milestone in this specific genre. It was the first such film to be completely computer-generated, and fully exploited this technological advance to the maximum to tell its tale with great humour and conviction. A rare 'family film' that everyone in the family will genuinely enjoy; adults for its sophisticated charm, and children for its affectionate, imaginative fantasy about what toys get up to when humans leave the room."], ["An amazing family film", "Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike.It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more.The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood.I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film.Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys."], ["One of the greatest family movies EVER!", "My kids are now 10 and 8, they have been watching this movie since they were able to sit up. They still watch it, and I still watch it with them. This is a movie like Dumbo, Snow White and Monsters Inc that you will keep forever.The idea of toys being alive and having the simple desire to be played with. The story is excellent and filled with humor for both kids and adults. The art and sound of the movie are absolutely top notch.My favorite part of the movie, does not even happen in the movie, it happens when your kids go to play in their room. This movie TEACHES kids how to play with toys again. Sadly due to nintendos, computers and other electronic gadgets, kids no longer know how to pretend or use their imagination. The pure brilliant fun of making a house out of a cardboard box, parachute out of a grocery bag and using your imagination to make a story. I saw my daughters taping pieces of cardboard together and creating a story with her ponies and plastic dogs. It brought a tear to my eye.I hope to one day watch this movie with my grand kids, and play after.One of the greatest movies ever."], ["Another Childhood Favorite!!!", "I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!!"], ["Just watched it again after many years...", "I just watched this film a few nights ago after many years. It is still a very great movie. It still played on my emotions. It got my 6 year old sister hooked, who has a 'low attention span' as you might call it. It was one of the most realistic films for it's age. It had one of the best story plots ever. The characters were perfect. The ending was very epic, and made tears come, especially during the the 'flying with style' line's second appearance when they are in the air at the end of the movie.I'm going to re-watch Toy Story 2 and hope that I can say the same thing about that one. But all I can say about Toy Story 1, is that it's the first movie I can honestly review as a 10."], ["Sensational animation.", "Just who knew how well this Disney-Pixar collaboration would be accepted.

Woody's authority becomes challenged by a high-tech space ranger named Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen). While Woody and Buzz deal with their rivalry, the group of toys need to band together to survive the kid next door Sid(Erik Von Detten), who thrives on feeding stuffed animals and toys to his vicious dog.

The plot revolves around cherished sheriff toy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who's tossed over by Andy in favour of shiny new space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Buzz, meanwhile, is convinced he's the saviour of the galaxy, as opposed to just being a toy. It's on a smaller scale than later Pixar efforts, and of course digital animation has developed a lot in the past 15 years, but it's very well done, with appealing characters, clever jokes - including a great recurring gag about Woody being a murderer - and a lot of heart, reinforced by Randy Newman's lovely song score. One complaint: as Lasseter points out on the DVD, Woody's monologue in Sid's room, perhaps the best scene in the film, shouldn't have been trimmed. The extended scene is even better.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today", "As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box.

A terrific movie for all ages. Tom Hanks delivers a believable character in Woody, and this is clearly some of Tim Allen's best work in his career, if not his BEST, he often just plays boring frustrated dad characters, it gets really old, and he doesn't have any energy, but his voice works as Buzz Lightyear. Altogether the movie is funny, the story's well crafted, enjoyable to watch over and over again. Very much advised to watch this over the much overrated The Incredibles, this one's actually great.

Toy story amazed everyone on earth back in 1995 and still does to this day. That amazes us and so does Pixar. Bringing us some of the best films of our time. Nowadays we have Up, Ratatouille, Wall E, Finding Nemo. The list goes on. But we should remember the first one.Toy story stars Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as Toys. Hanks plays Woody, a cowboy toy who is the most popular from his owner Andy. That all changes when Andy buys a toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) who is an astronaut. Woody becomes awfully jealous and tries everything in his power to get rid of Buzz.There are other plot points that I would rather not go into. Toy story creeps me out a little. The thing about it that creeps me out is the villain named Sid. Sid is this toy murderer who lives next door to Andy and the toy gang. There is a part in the end when all of the toys retaliate. That part scares me every time. Watching these destroyed toys retaliate. I never thought something like that could creep me out. I guess I get creeped too easily.The first Toy story is a work of art. It's got great visuals and will creep you out. Kind of like Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas carol, which is another work of art I think.

I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case: animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including \"Light-beer\") who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike.

I wished that I had a Woody or a Buzz Lightyear doll. I even wished that my Mr. Potato Head would talk back to me, even though that might be a little scary- it would be cool. I liked the personality that each toy had. I didn't really understand the concept of the movie was revolving around friendship, but I loved the new way they were starting to make movies. It led to so many more movies that I loved like A \"Bug's Life\" and \"Shrek.\""], ["Nice movie", "Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated family/buddy film, directed by John Lasseter and featuring the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.

It was the first feature film released to use only computer-generated imagery.I used to watch the movie when I was a child. Actually, I hardly watch it, but I had a chance to watch it recently!!

I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary. This movie is still ahead of it's time, by a large margin.8.5/10"], ["Still first ate", "It was a classic on the day it was released, and it's still a classic 10 years later. The story is great, the characters are great, the voice talent is great, and the animation is great. Only the detail suffers by comparison with current computer animated films, but that is perhaps only to be expected.I was surprised and delighted to note Joss Whedon at the top of the list of those responsible for the screenplay - his name means a lot more to me now than it did 10 years ago.This 3D retooling is interesting. For one thing, it demonstrates that it is a relatively easy exercise for CGI animated features. Having said that, it doesn't add an awful lot to Toy Story. Given that the film wasn't envisaged as a 3D feature, there aren't any sequences specifically designed to showcase 3D. The climactic chase and rocket scene works well, and there are scattered moments which make you go, \"Oh, look!\" But nothing which makes you go \"Wow!\" In the way the trailer (created specially for this 3D version) did.But watching Toy Story, 2D or 3D, is never a waste of time - it's that good."], ["Fantastically Enjoyable Classic", "Toy Story is about an old cowboy doll's jealousy toward a new spaceman toy, and the trouble it gets them into. The movie is a joy to watch, with a witty script jam-packed with hilarious gags and funny lines, wrapped up in an engaging, adventure-type plot. It's filled with appealing characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast. Tom Hanks as the cowboy and Tim Allen as the spaceman fit their roles perfectly, backed up by the amusing support of R. Lee Ermy, Jim Varney, and John Ratzenberger.

It was amazing how the toys sort of live a double life, behaving like humans when no one's looking. I loved how all the toys are like a big family, with Woody being like a leader. As for Buzz Lightyear, I thought he was going to be really tall, but it turns out, he's shorter than he appeared. It was hilarious how Buzz believed he was a \"space ranger\". Also, Woody and Buzz sort of reminded me of Tawni and Sonny from the show Sonny With a Chance when they first met. Both Buzz and Sonny were \"the new kid\" who got accepted by almost everyone, and both Woody and Tawni were the only one who didn't accept the \"new kid\" and got jealous (but eventually learned to accept the \"new kid\").

I was a great fan of animation movies as nearly every child is, so I was very excited about it. And, I have to say that it has exceeded my expectations in every possible way and knocked me out of the ring. The concept of toys talking when humans aren't around caused a certain excitement in me, I was happy that toys were alive, I was a child again without knowing it. The characters are so well designed that one gets intensely attached to them.Especially Buzz Light Year, when I was a child I dreamed of wearing a space suit and traveling in space with a jet pack at my side. And when I saw Buzz, I was totally surprised at how my thoughts of a super hero were projected into reality. And Woody is a great character, the Mr. Popular , the guy next door, call what you may he is that. And the rest of characters are equally good. The story itself looks very wonderful on the screen.Although the movie starts off as a feel good comedy for kids, it ends exactly in the opposite direction. It gradually turns into an epic adventures touching the heart and marking a smile on everyone's face. Great Movie."], ["Where Pixar's legacy begins", "Before they became the trailblazers of computer animation, Pixar eked out a meagre existence as a small, independent company, forced to provide computer visual effects for other studios just to pay the bills. Although it seems impossible now, there was a time when Pixar hinged on the brink of bankruptcy on a daily basis. And the idea of creating a fully, computer animated feature film seemed a far off, distant fantasy.After producing several highly acclaimed short films, Pixar's dream of making a full proper feature came to fruition when they entered into a partnership with Disney that still continues today. Thanks to some generous investors, a real team effort and a wing and a prayer, Pixar got the go-ahead on their debut feature, Toy Story.Toy Story is where the Pixar legacy begins. It was the first of its kind and a huge success. Despite all of the doubts and preconceptions, they had pulled it out of the bag and Pixar's name was made. They created an entire revolution in animation. One that had never been seen before.But it took a lot to go through to get there. Toy Story had a tumultuous history before it even made it to the big screen. According to the excellent documentary The Pixar Story, the script went through numerous rewrites, particularly with Woody's character. In Pixar's own words, Woody was becoming \"the most repellent thing you've ever seen\". The film just wasn't working. It was cynical. Sarcastic. It wasn't funny at all. And it wasn't the film John Lasseter imagined when he originated it.With all that in mind, its all the more surprising how good it turned out to be. Toy Story has all of the qualities we've come to expect from the best of Pixar's work. Its confident. Its witty. It moves at a gallop and its intelligent too. Its one thing to make a whole new kind of film. Its another to make it work well.The plot is a quite familiar one - toys that come to life when no-one's around. But Pixar put some fascinating spins on that one sentence synopsis thanks to some well etched characters, a fabulous script penned by a great team of writers, a charming musical score and fluid animation. Woody and Buzz Lightyear have become two of Pixar's much beloved creations. With Woody being such a jerk in the early days of Toy Story's conception, it may explain why Pixar brought in Hollywood's Nicest Guy Tom Hanks to voice him.Some of Woody's character flaws have still made it into the film. But that may be one of the reasons why people were so drawn to it. Because he's not so squeaky clean compared with Disney heroes. A pull-string cowboy doll, the king of his mountain, when his owner Andy gets Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger action figure, and winds up cast aside, he goes mad with envy. He's as flawed as any flesh and blood person. A little selfish too. But not so much that he's irredeemable (which he almost wound up as in the early drafts).But Buzz Lightyear is an even better character. He's a true original. Because unlike all the other toys around him, he doesn't know he is one. He believes he's a real space ranger. And the film is clever the way it wittily plays into Buzz's delusions about himself. He's so convinced of what he is that its a genuinely crushing moment when Buzz finds out the truth (a nicely played scene when he watches a Buzz Lightyear TV commercial).Pixar always have a knack for matching the right actors to their characters. And Tim Allen is a perfect Buzz Lightyear. He captures the right blend of cocky bravado and self-righteous intent that the character so desperately needs to endear. Unlike all the other companies quick to jump on the CGI animation bandwagon, Pixar don't pick big name actors to ensure box-office success. They choose the right people to bring their characters to life.The animation in Toy Story could seem primitive now when compared to the dazzling backdrops of Finding Nemo or Wall-E. The backgrounds are not as detailed and even the climax is not that lavish (Pixar didn't yet have a limitless budget to command) but they don't really need to be because its story is enough of a hook to enthrall us.One thing they could have done without though is showing us the faces of the human characters. They tend to look too unreal when computer animated. Pixar hadn't quite got the hang yet of making a human face look natural. Not until The Incredibles anyway.But these are only minor quibbles. In all other regards, Toy Story is a delight. Even at this early stage, Pixar has the formula down perfectly that gets them through each and every one of their films. Great characters, shrewd intelligence, genuine heart and a real sense of fun and adventure. Toy Story 2 is even better. It ups all the good things about this by a quantum factor. A great start for a superb studio.To Infinity and Beyond!"], ["A delightful film for children of all ages", "While I don't think 3D computer animation has the charm of well made hand drawn 2D animation this film comes close due to the delightful characters and well thought out story.The story opens on the day of Andy's birthday party and his toys, led by Woody the cowboy are concerned about what presents he might receive, fearing he will get a toy that will supplant them in his affections. Of course he does get a shiny new toy, a Buzz Lightyear action figure. which is Andy's new favourite. Woody is upset about this and plots to get Buzz lost behind a dresser, unfortunately this goes wrong and Buzz is knocked out of the window. Since Andy can't find Buzz he picks up Woody when he is taken to \"Pizza Planet\". Outside Woody is finds Buzz but is soon separated from Andy. The two of them unite to try to get back to Andy but things take turn for the worse when they are \"captured\" by Andy's evil neighbour Sid, a horrid child who likes to destroy toys. Things go from bad to worse when Buzz learns that he is merely a toy and not the real Buzz Lightyear as featured on a TV show.Obviously this is a children's film but that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it just as much, it is a great story that just happens to be about toys that come alive. The characters are all well designed and as a viewer I cared about what happened to them. This film is clearly destined to be a classic as it isn't bogged down with pop culture references which would cease to be funny in a few years.

Growing up watching the move through-out your child-hood, it brought you to wonder if your toys really did move. This is how a kids movie should be. There are excellent characters, realistic animation for its time. Lets think about it, the movie was made in 1995 we're approaching 15-17 years since its release now and the animation is still fairly decent. There's a little bit of everything in Toy Story that makes it suitable for all ages, the characters, the humor, the emotion -- its one of those rare animations, that everyone young or old will enjoy and that's why it up-holds as one of the best animated movies to hit cinema.

I watched it again recently and despite my age was pissing myself with laughter. This is mainly down to the characters who are so fresh. The banter between woody and Buzz is terrific (\"YOU ARE A TOY!!!\") and the other characters are also brilliant, especially ,for me, the bitter, angry and cynical Mr potato head , who lends a slightly darker more adult edge to this film compared to the Pixar movies to come ,as well as Sid his dog and the mutilated toys he has created. It is after all the only pixar movie rated parental guidance, i think which lets the emotions of the characters be more human in the shape of jealousy, pride and competitiveness. The central ideas of toys being alive when you cant see them is probably their best idea to date just in sheer amount of imagination and the amount of opportunity and possibility it creates (their is after all a sequel) and does kind of become a template for later. This definitely provided a lifeline for Disney who had seriously passed its golden age, and were starting to lose their reputation of quality and connection with its younger and older audience. With Lasseter moving to head of creative output at Disney, hopefully he will put them back on track also.(By the way I noticed a lack of any fathers in it, I don't know if thats meant to be read into)"], ["Toy Story was like the Snow White of 1995", "I remember going and seeing Toy Story when I was 5 years old at the movies.

Saw this movie many times. Nowadays(25-01-2009) Jetix channel(India) airs this movie once in two months and dubbed in Tamil. I have seen the original English version many times and today this Tamil version. Felt both are equally good.The story. For kids. Toys of a boy Andy can all 'talk' i.e. they live like human beings. And there enters a new toy into Andy's life as his birthday present. The current favourite 'Woody' and the new entry have a struggle to win Andy's favourite toy position. Things happening in this struggle is the movie.This is definitely not an adult's movie. But if an adult could pretend to like toys that come 'alive' then no problem.The things I like about this movie is imagination, plastic-feel art work of scenes and music. Its simple. The characters including woody(Tom Hanks) and 'Buzz Light year' (famous cartoon character) were voiced perfectly. Some emotional turns with Buzz who believes that he really is a 'space ranger'. The Disney people's art work is different, creative and innovative and making standards in animation films.Disfiguring a toy is a behavior we can see in many children. I don't know about any reasons why some kids like it. On any account, the film just eases that mind, encourages confidence even if you are just a 'toy', and coordinating as a team.

For the person who thought up the idea of toys coming to life, thank you. You have given this world an imaginative theory, which will be with us every time we leave the room.Though everything about this film is exquisite, the ideology of living toys makes it what it is. When we first see Woody get up off the bed we need to blink a couple of times to make sure its real. Of course with modern technology CGI is hard not to use and this film was one of the first that was used effectively and though has now lost its significance. Nothing is lost in terms of the story however and the visuals and the finest direction Pixar ever achieved until Wall-E help create a warm fun family film. Will any other company beat Pixar on the animation stage? Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar, though all good, don't have that extra depth and sophistication Pixar creates so easily.Filled with great laughs and a suspense adventure, Toy Story is a sit down and enjoyable movie for the whole family. But then it is so much more than a movie.Every Pixar movie has a message. Wall-E provided an insight into loneliness and the good of man kind, Monsters Inc told the tale of children's fairy tales and Cars reflects doing something for others.This 1995 hit preaches to its audience through its characters. Woody's jealousy at being replaced and his suffering are almost tear worthy. We have all had our favourite toys and replaced them and this simple message will trigger something deep down inside any viewer. Buzz's commitment to who he really is and his strong beliefs are great in shaping his character and preaching to viewers to believe who they really are.Most importantly though is friendship and how important it can be to get someone out of trouble for the good of someone else. This message is further emphasised through the best Pixar song of all time, \"You've got a friend in me\" Always consistent, always funny and always entertaining, Toy Story is a fun family film that will forever be remembered for its strong messages, entertainment and animation."], ["Great fun for everyone", "I just watched this movie for the first time since I was 12 (I'm 24 now). A lot of times when I view films I liked as a child, my perspective as an adult changes, by either noticing how little effort was put into certain films, or just that storyline/quality isn't there.Toy Story does not do this. As the first fully CG film, the detail I must say is fantastic and quite smooth. There is subtle adult humor in there that no child will be able to pick up, which makes this a great family flick, since both adults and children can enjoy it.The plot is original and quite interesting. And too anybody who ever lost a \"Toy\" as a child, sometimes you may wonder, if they got up on their own and walked away.It's sad that now and days, family films/kids films don't focus as much on story and dilogue like they used too and things just become a jumbled mess or completely juvenile. This film has quality story, dilogue and voice acting.And unlike a lot of other Disney movies which portray violence and some direct indendendo, this takes a lighter comedic side and it's a refreshing change from some films prior to it and even things made till this day.With that it also displays human emotions (Exaggerated of course for what they toys are feeling) But none the less, displays the essence of feeling replaced, or trying to be something you want to be,without having the means to do so.I highly reccemmend this to anybody who hasn't seen it yet. If you're and adult, don't be turned off by the CG animation. It's not by any means like a cartoon."], ["What a memory", "I'll admit I'm probably not old enough or this film wasn't released long enough to say this.

With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today.The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details.The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his \"stupid little cardboard spaceship.\" Buzz is a \"cool\" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz.This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them.To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved."], ["A marvellous feat of CGI", "Toy Story is a brilliant feat in the world of animated film, and was successful at the box office and well received by critics. The films success spawned a sequel in 1999 and a second sequel is to be released in 2010.The story is about the cowboy doll Woody who is the favourite toy of a boy named Andy. Woody and the rest of Andy's toys all live together in Andy's bedroom, but Woody is the only one who is allowed to sleep in Andy's bed. Woody's position feels threatened when Andy receives a new action figure, an astronaut Buzz Lightyear, for his birthday. Because of Buzz Lightyear's fancy special features, Buzz replaces Woody as 'favourite toy'. Woody grows more and more jealous as the other toys accept Buzz into their community, and see him as some kind of leader because of his special features. When Andy decides to take Buzz on a family outing and not Woody, Woody feels offended. For revenge, Woody tries to trap Buzz behind a desk so that Andy will be forced to take Woody instead. However, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, and the other toys see this as an attempt to murder Buzz. Woody is ostracised by the other toys. Woody does get taken on the family outing with Andy but unbeknownst to him, Buzz hops aboard the car as it leaves. During the outing, Buzz and Woody both become separated from Andy, who accidentally leaves them behind when he goes back home. Buzz and Woody must put aside their differences and work together if there is any chance of getting back home.The animation of Toy Story is very impressive. The animators use very effective cinematic techniques that make you feel as though you are watching a live-action film rather than an animation. Toy Story was ground-breaking as this level of entirely CGI animation in a film had never been done before, and CGI in films had only started being used widely a few years earlier. The characters of Toy Story act and move like real people, and give the impression of having realistic weight. The animators get the effect of light with precision, and the animation barely feels out dated at all; modern animation do not necessarily seem any more advanced than this film. Unlike cartoons such as The Simpsons, the characters of Toy Story are based on human features. They move about as though they have the same body parts as humans.Toy Story is a brilliant film in my opinion. It works on many levels so it can appeal to all people aged between 3 and 90. As far as its animation, it was absolutely brilliant for its time, and, as I said earlier, holds up very well today. The story is sharp and entertaining, full of hilarity, from toilet humour to dry wit; anyone will be able to find something funny about this film. The characters are also very lovable and the viewer feels attached to them in the first few minutes. I would definitely give this film a good four stars out of five.

It also enters an arcade- restaurant that recaptures that consumerist wonder of being a kid surrounded by video games and pizza. Its heroes are toys, which come to life when nobody is watching. Its conflict is between an old-fashioned cowboy doll who has always been an 8-year-old boy's favorite toy, the effective leader of the kid's toys as a collective community, and the new action figure who is starting to take his place. The villain is the grungy kid next door who takes toys apart and puts them back together again in morbid mishmashes, that is when he's not blowing them with fireworks. And the result is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie experience that does not diminish with age.For kids, a movie like this works immaculately because it tells a fun story that presumably exists already somewhere in their minds when they are playing with their own toys. They can relate very deeply to these toy characters because of the role toys play in their lives. Older viewers can be even more immersed, because you find that after all these years, you still have such emotion invested in these toys. When Woody peeks from the toy chest at his boy, Andy, sleeping with Buzz Lightyear in his arms, I am truly touched. If you saw this as a kid and haven't seen it since, feeling you have outgrown it, you must revisit it, for you will discover quite the contrary.In a way, it could have been even more interesting and rewarding to have been your parents' age in 1995 when the film emerged as the first film animated entirely by computer. To us as kids, visual nuance was the last thing on our minds. The most rudimentary elements of the cinematic experience were all that mattered to us, and we were transported. Now, we are completely accustomed to Pixar's series of family films that transcend what one normally perceives as the cornball throwaway inanity of so many of them.John Lasseter opens the film in the---let's face it---spoiled 8-year-old's bedroom, where the toys come to life when their owner is gone. Each of the toy characters is rich and detailed. The playroom cunningly figures in well-known toys from real life, which may be product placement, but who cares when it functions as a great way for us to relate that much more with these characters by means of direct familiarity."], ["You can never go wrong with Woody and Buzz Lightyear!", "10 years. 20 years.

The animation is astounding considering that it was done over ten years ago (1995). I highly recommend this movie and I consider it one of the best animated made ever. The songs are a bit sappy but perfect for animated movies and the music is right on par. I definitely without a doubt give this movie 5 stars.0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Review", "Disney and Pixar team up to create Disney's first full-length computer animated cinematic masterpiece, Toy story. Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures.Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure.There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations. Both adults and children will be entertained with the concept of living toys. The plot of the movie is really where it shines. There isn't one point in Toy Story where the plot gets boring or dragged out. People at Disney's Pixar developed the characters so well that it makes you understand how characters behave. Also, with a movie with so many diverse characters the audience is bound to find someone relate to. The only downside about seeing this movie is its length. It is around eighty minutes but it seems like the movie is about two hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't a full price movie because it is absolutely worth your time. Toy Story is definitely recommended to all families and especially kids. As for everyone else as an audience, I would recommend the movie if you would like to revisit your child hood or if you just want to see a beautifully animated movie. Whoever the audience may be, Toy Story will put a smile on your face.Toy Story is a classic beyond all means. It has stunning visuals, a crazy plot, deep character development, and most importantly it brings people back to a time when nothing mattered except toys. The most inspiring aspect of the movie is the moral of friendship. It really teaches people that they can't get anywhere in life without companionship. Toy Story also really captured the thought of \"what if toys were alive\" and executed it in a witty way. This movie will definitely be playing on family TV screens till \"Infinity and Beyond\"!"], ["A timeless classic.", "Toy Story is truly a groundbreaking film. The animations are amazing and the story and these characters are so lovable,humorous and just flawless no matter how many time you have watched it. Woody and Buzz beat a giant ogre and a talking donkey any day of the week. The animations on the film inspired movies like The Incredibles, Shrek,Finding Memo and others. Toy Story's plot is about a boy named Andy whose playing with his toys, such as a Mr. Potato Head, Rex, and his favorite toy, Woody. He takes Woody into the living room and plays with him some more, where he learns Andy has planned his birthday a few days early, as himself, his mother, and his sister Molly will be moving. Woody gets put back in the room, and when Andy leaves, he's revealed to be the leader of the toys, and orders them to be prepared for the party. All the toys work together, aware that new toys could mean the replacement of current ones, but Woody keeps them calm. After Andy goes through all his presents, he's surprised by one last present from his mother. The present is revealed to be a new must-have Buzz Lightyear toy.They all return to their places as Andy and his friends come running up to Andy's room. When they all run out, the toys approach the Buzz Lightyear action figure. Buzz does not seem to be aware that he is a toy, which becomes apparent after he sees the package he came in (a space ship shaped box) to be his damaged ship. He believes himself to be a space ranger on a mission to save the universe from \"the evil Emperor Zurg.\" The other toys take to him immediately, being impressed by his many features. Only Woody is unconvinced, showing jealousy towards Buzz. As time moves on, Andy clearly shows to have high regard of Buzz, seemingly forgetting about Woody, as with the other toys who Buzz spends a lot of time with. By the end of the day, Andy sleeps with Buzz in his arms and confirms he has a new favorite toy. Eventually, Woody confronts Buzz while he is repairing his \"ship\" where he finally realizes that Buzz actually believe himself to be the real space ranger, and not toy model of the character.Andy is given a surprise trip to his favorite restaurant: Pizza Planet. However, he can take only one toy with him. Knowing this, Woody assumes he'll take Buzz so he tries to shove him behind Andy's dresser, but instead inadvertently knocks him out the window. When the other toys learn of Woody's actions, they think he has turned into a killer. They try to attack him without even giving him a chance to explain, but he is saved when Andy come into the room to look for Buzz. Unable to find Buzz, Andy takes Woody on the trip instead. At a gas stop, Woody finds that Buzz grabbed a hold of the family's minivan and is with them. Woody tries to apologize but Buzz won't listen, and starts a fight which knocks both out of the minivan that causes them to be left behind. I remember watching this film when i was about four years old and having Woody and Buss figures and waiting for them to come to life when they thought i wasn't looking. That's the impact a film and interesting Toy characters could do to a little kid. This film remains my favorite animated movie ever and one of my favorite movies ever. Talking Toys, a mean bully who hates toys, a thrilling adventure with spectacular animation and some of the best characters ever. There is not much to go into about the plot or anything, it is simply put a perfect film for all ages it even has some small adult humor and that you don't get anymore. 10/10"], ["a Pixar classic and one of the best family movies of all time", "Tom Hanks and Tim Allen put their talents at voice acting to work and they do it with thorough and complete perfection in \"Toy Story\" a Pixar animated classic film that even now, over ten years since its theatrical debut, continues to be loved by audiences of all ages. It retells the child's dream of their inanimate toys suddenly coming to life whenever a human is not around. All of the toys have personalities and they are even organized as their own society.Tom Hanks plays the voice of Woody, a cowboy doll with a pull string and Tim Allen provides the voice of Buzz Lightyear, a new action figure toy that has crushed all other toys at the market--but the thing is, Buzz believes he is really THE character he represents and not an Asian-made product. Among them there are other toys such as Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). All of the voices are done well and creates the illusion of real talking characters instead of actors providing voices and then having animators synchronize their 3D models with the prerecorded sounds.Now that I am older, I appreciate and cherish \"Toy Story\" and its successful sequel \"Toy Story 2\" (1999) even more than I did when I first saw them as a kid. I now appreciate the character elements, can understand the point of the jokes better, and respect the talents and efforts of the filmmakers who made this movie possible.

That's the best thing about Pixar is that all their movies are intelligent and they like to show us the possibilities. It's an amazing journey to see what your toys would be like if they were alive.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have great chemistry that just leaps off screen and the rest of the cast is great. I love all the characters, how so many of them are older toys like Woody and Slinky and how much Andy really loves all his toys. This is a film I know will be considered one of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen's greatest performances. This film is one of the most amazing and wonderful films that all children should see and love.

Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar.

Except \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Cars\", \"Toy Story\" is the best of all the Pixar films (here comes a little SPOILER; this movie is not presented with the Pixar logo at the beginning of the film, before the title credits. SPOILERS OVER). It's like some TV-series; the first seasons are sometimes the best, right?Anyway, I watch \"Toy Story\" for the first time when I was 11 and I enjoyed it. It's never been my favorite movie of all times, but it's a enjoyable and watchable movie. The animation is gorgeous, the story is simple, but well-defined and the script is good. It's a good idea to make a CGI computer animated movie about toys that comes alive (SPOILERS; when the humans aren't watching. SPOILERS OVER).This film has some more adult humor comparing to the Disney hand-drawn films before 1995, which is quite good. (SPOILER) Most of the characters are simple and well-defined, except the sarcastic Hamm and Mr. Potato Head (not that I dislike them, but they deliver a more sophisticated humor than the rest of the characters). Woody is a more human main character, who makes really big mistakes in the movie, but learn what's wrong and what's right.My favorite characters were Buzz (I absolutely love his lines), Slinky (who stand up for Woody more than he deserves) and Scud, Sid's dog, who definitely should be in the sequel. (SPOILERS OVER).This movie has some scenes that could may be considered a little spooky for the youngest children, but for those who are 8 years old and upward, it's a suitable movieWhat I didn't like in this film is the score of Randy Newman, who is actually very annoying and too sugary for me. Unfortenaly he became the composer of most of the Pixar's film. But the songs in \"Toy Story\" are working quite all right.

It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie.Woody, is the \"top toy\" of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think \"Let's kill Woody!\" Wow, the irony in it all!

The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear!I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun.

The voice overs are top notch and everyone gets a fair share in this movie. PIXAR has done a good job placing itself on the map.Set in Andy's room and before the family moves, his mother decides to throw a birthday party for the young lad. Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle.Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel.

Tom Hanks provides the voice of Woody the Cowboy, who is the ringleader of the toys around Andy's room. He overhears the important events around Andy's life and one of the things shocking is that they are moving to another home.Most of Andy's toys are compiled of average boy toys: from a nervous dinosaur name Rex (Wallace Shawn) to a grumpy Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickels), a smart Aleck piggy bank called Hamm (John Ratzenburg); even Andy's little sister has toys that join with the gang, Bo Peep (Annie Potts of \"Ghostbusters\" fame) has a crush on the cowboy. There are other characters in the story; a dog on a string name Slinky Dog (Jim Varney of \"Ernest\" fame) and a plastic army doll name Sarge (R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket).One of the elements of \"Toy Story\" is very psychological, and that is the fear of a new toy. Sure everybody likes to get a new toy, but the problem is that when people buy new toys, they automatically forget that their old toys exist and lose excitement within them. When Andy's birthday party comes a week before the leave, Woody sends Sarge and the plastic army men with the baby talkers to hear what kind of presents Andy has gotten this year. As Mr. Potato jokes that he wants a wife, the gang gets cut off by a nervous Rex and realize that the toys have to stay still.The new toy in Andy's life is the popular and all out, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) in which he pushes Woody to the side leaving the new toy on the bed. Everybody clamors over Woody being pushed off the bed as every other toy in the room tries to figure out what's up there.Woody is introduced to the new character as he tells everyone he can fly and fire a high laser. A smart-ass Potato Head makes a statement about Woody's voice box that it sounds a car ran over it. Days before the move, Woody is left out of the group as everybody including Bo Peep are all with Buzz Lightyear.Woody has a plan of getting rid of Buzz and he uses an electric race-car to push him out the window. Now every toy is against Woody and want to beat him up; but Andy saves Woody when him and the rest of his family are going out for pizza and can't find Buzz, so Andy takes the cowboy instead. With little relief, when the car stops at a gas station, Buzz has been hiding under the car and fights with Woody outside; suddenly the car leaves with both toys stranded.Buzz has a plan for both him and Woody to get back with Andy; they get into a pizza truck and try to find Andy and his family and notices that the neighborhood bully Sid is there so the toys hide in a toy machine where they are taken with another toy back to Sid's house where one toy is torture to death (relax, its not the main toys). So now they have to work together in order to be with Andy and tell the other toys that everything is all right.\"Toy Story\" is a blessing with delight and wonder and just like my review of \"Monsters, Inc.\" it's a movie of curiosity and a joy to behold."], ["Best!", "This is a cartoon but not only for children, anybody can enjoy this wonderful movie.

I think that Disney done an exceptional job on the movie in parts where the Pizza Planet scene was taken because of the reality of the crane machine and the little green aliens.

Peer pressure, stealing to get what you want, confronting violence, insecurity, jealously, competition, first-love, friendship, and revenge are all parts of the magic of Toy Story.

You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages.

Woody is Andy's favourite toy and like all the other toys lives with the fear of being discarded when new toys arrive. He's therefore very worried when Buzz Lightyear arrives. Buzz is an instant hit with Andy and Woody is not very happy. To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys.There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids. The real winning combination of Toy Story is the characterisation and the empathy you can feel for the animated leads. Although they're not real this is one of the best buddy movies ever made.

Enjoyed by young and old alike, this is funny even for the most bitter minded. After all, what's not to like? It isn't a three hour epic like `Gone With The Wind' but it is thoroughly entertaining for its eighty minute running time and hastily avoids wearing out its welcome.Not only is the animation brilliant but the characters are even better. Tom Hanks was perfectly chosen as the neurotic, jealous but easily likeable Woody. He proves that he can do comedy, even if he doesn't physically appear in the movie. Always reliable for his comedy, Tim Allen certainly delivers jokes at a rapid rate. And he perfectly fits into the role as Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry between the two main characters is priceless. Sure, they aren't `Bogart and Bacall' but they make a great duo. The supporting cast of characters include Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head and Little Bo Peep. They are brilliantly animated and while most of the limelight goes to Woody and Buzz, they still make good use of the scenes they're in.The film was soon followed by a sequel `Toy Story 2' in '99. While the animation was more impressive and it was a bigger film, I still preferred the first one. Mainly because `Toy Story' had more chemistry between Woody and Buzz. But also because the sequel didn't have as many good laughs and aimed for boring sentimentality a bit too often.So overall, `Toy Story' is an outstanding breakthrough in the world of animation.  The comedy, visuals and level of enjoyment are all picture perfect.

The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story.The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up \u0096 something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space!Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home.Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!).The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others \u0096 such as Mr. Potato Head \u0096 are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include \u0091Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep \u0096 who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries!The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back.Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully \u0091classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible.The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the \u0091Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films \u0096 particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly \u0091tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations.All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again.And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them?

The film has so many plot holes in it I actually lost count. Now before I start this review, I'm not going to say toys talking is a plot hole, the idea of them talking is interesting but it opens up so many other questions that the movie never really explains. Also, don't argue, \"it's a kids movie\", films need to make sense in order to work whether they're for kids or not. This film is so bad and here is why. Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I'm making here:Buzz thinks he's a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn't make sense given that Buzz doesn't believe he's a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz's helmet and he gasps for air, you're telling me Andy never pushed that button? He's owned the toy for weeks yet hadn't pressed all the buttons? Rubbish.The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It's broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn't he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy's car. Andy's car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this???The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don't understand. It's never fully explained. Continuing this point: when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn't have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate.Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is: Why can't toys reveal they're alive to humans??? It's never explained and I don't get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful."], ["Toy Story 9/10, Toy Story 3-D 5/10- rip off", "Let me explain. I love films. Toy Story is beyond excellent.

Children would be lost, bored, terrified, or scarred by the adult fare, while adults would be lost, bored, and uncomfortable at the kiddie flicks. Fortunately, \"Toy Story\" changed everything.For a basic plot summary, this all-CGI film focuses on the childhood toys of young Andy. At first, Andy is in his \"cowboy stage\", and so western doll Woody (Tom Hanks) is his prized possession. However, once Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) arrives via an extra-special birthday present, things begin to change inside the toybox, as the two begin a battle for supremacy over young Andy.There are two main areas in which this movie succeeds so brilliantly: First, it is incredible eye- candy for children. Running the gamut from every type of toy and crazy situation imaginable, this film enraptures the kiddies and will have them watching over and over.Second, it works because you will be watching it over and over with them! As you marvel at the CGI effects, you will also be laughing at the hilarious jokes that, while going right over your kid's head, will make you burst into laughter. This is mainly accomplished by the cast of \"supporting\" characters such as the wise-cracking Hamm (John Ratzenberger), the cowardly dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn), the loyal dog Slink (Jim Varney), and the ever-sardonic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). Their jokes and humorous situations will make it feel as if you aren't watching a kids movie at all.Also, though the technology has come a long way even since this film's 1995 release date, it is still no less of a filmmaking marvel. For perhaps the first time in cinema history, computer- animation actually made you feel as if you were watching a \"real\" film, not just a cheap special- effects bonanza.Overall, \"Toy Story\" is one of the most influential films ever produced for its ability to blur the lines between children and adult cinema.

The box office collected nearly $364,402,211 worldwide off of this movie alone. While Toy Story was released over ten years ago, Americans of all ages today are still viewing the movie for leisure entertainment. Aspects such as plot development, thematic lessons, cinematography and animation, and originality are all qualities that make the movie stand above its counterparts. The plot development and basis of the movie are relatable to multiple audiences. The film takes place in a suburban, upscale neighborhood in which Andy Davis and his family live in a colonial, two story, stereotypical, 1990's home. While the family goes about living normal day- to day life, behind the scenes is where the action intensifies and this is where the story inevitably begins. What appeals to most children while watching the movie, are the \"talking toys\" that create their own story midst the chaotic Davis household. As the toys come to life, there are several characters that prominently take the spotlight. Beginning with Sheriff Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks. This is Andy's favorite toy, and inevitably takes on an established leadership role throughout the movie. Continuing on, the audience is introduced to heroic Buzz Lightyear voiced by Tim Allen. Buzz creates much skepticism amongst the other toys and consequently creates the first sub climax of the movie, as a struggle for power emerges between Buzz and Woody. As the movie progresses, there are many thematic lessons to be taken by audience members, regardless of age. Of course Disney never fails to incorporate enlightening take home messages into the production. This is the benefit to this movie in comparison to other animated films. Positivity in realm of life's negative events that are often out of our control is one way in which Disney and Pixar films continue to boast their movie popularity. Director John Lasseter thoroughly thought through every detail in the making of the movie, and this was never so apparent than in the close attention to detail portrayed in animation and cinematography. The colors used were bright and cheerful, as well as the authenticity of the costuming of the character's clothes were accurate in terms of realistic concepts. Furthermore, the voice lines conveyed by Allen and Hanks were portrayed with great enthusiasm to fit the characters' bubbly personalities. Lasseter also nailed this aspect in that the dialogue was simplistic enough to be understood by younger audiences, however witty, personal, and quirky enough to enthuse more mature audiences as well. Originality is a quality that every movie must have, but only the best of movies convey properly. The fact that this movie was released in 1995, and is still viewed today by many different generations is a quality that in itself deserves to be recognized. Looking back at the simplicity of talking toys, it is monumental and worth noting that many details to enhance viewer attraction were presented to perfection to thoroughly create a movie that satisfies a wide variety of audiences. The production was backed by such popular demand in fact, that producing companies and director Lasseter released a sequel four years later. Taking over the charts, both movies scored over an 8.42 on the IMDb rating survey collection, and deservingly so."], ["A utter triumph that will live in our hearts forever", "this film changed my life, it showed me my favorite creative medium and molded my skill as a creator and as a human being.Review -The film opens on a simply stunning sequence of a young boy named Andy playing a make believe game of Cops and robbers with a gang of toys.

Computer animation has since become the dominant form of animation. Dreamworks, Warner Brothers, and Universal (and maybe some other companies I have forgotten) have created their own computer animation studios to rival Pixar. Pixar themselves would continue to push just how far animation could go, both in animation quality and in storytelling ambition.So one may wonder, 20 years after this all got started, is the one that started it all still excellent by today's standards? The answer is an emphatic YES.The story is fairly well known by now, but I'll repeat it anyway for those who are unfamiliar. This \"Toy Story\" centers around the toy cowboy Woody (wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of the young boy Andy (John Morris), who has several other toys, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (the late Jim Varney), and Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberg, whose consistent appearances in Pixar films has become a running gag of sorts - and was acknowledged as such in \"Cars\"). The film starts on Andy's birthday party, a time when all of his toys get nervous, because Andy might get a toy that he likes more than the others. Sure enough, he's received the latest \"cool\" toy, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, an inspired choice). This results in Woody being demoted to \"second best,\" something he doesn't take well at all. Woody attempts to push Buzz out of the way so he can get back to being Andy's favorite toy, but through a series of mistakes (and misadventures), he winds up making both he and Buzz separated from their owner Andy. Worse, they end up in the possession of their neighbor, Sid (Erik von Detten), who prefers to blow up his toys instead of play with them. Now Woody and Buzz have to make peace and work together if they are to return to Andy (oh, and did I mention that Andy is moving away soon?).The premise is simple enough, but it's in the execution where things get very inspired. Take, for example, how the toys attempt to learn what presents Andy is receiving. They send several Army Men Toy Soldiers down for a \"Code Red\" mission, and how these soldiers pull this off always puts a smile on my face. I still remember being inspired by watching the soldiers move that radio into that small leafy plant on the bottom floor (I was seven when I first saw this). I was so inspired, in fact, that a year later, I was \"teaching\" my toys how to hide in the Christmas tree during Christmas. Director John Lasseter and the Pixar team have deeply considered how a world of toys would work. How would a toy feel about getting relegated to \"second best\" when a new toy comes around? And it's pretty fun to see how the toys have to consistently make sure the \"human world\" never knows about their awareness.And the strength of this script goes beyond its consideration of a world of toys. Its tight and to the point. There are no wasted moments in the film's (short) 81-minute runtime. Pixar is not satisfied with simply showing what computer animation can do. They are interested in guiding along through a story that provides laughs, thrills, an occasional scare, and something valuable to learn at the end.Obviously, the quality of computer animation has improved greatly since this film first came out (watch how they animate a dog here, and compare it to how Pixar would animate Sullivan's fur in \"Monster's Inc.\", for example). But let's remember, at the time, this was considered to be massively advanced animation. Many adult critics wondered if kids would realize just how big of a breakthrough this was in the history of animation, but I can reassure them, I may have been only 7 years old, but even I realized an entirely computer animated film was a very big deal indeed! Looking back now, I do think we should consider some of the things the animators did in this film that further emphasized what computer animation should be going for. Gene Siskel pointed out that you could see a reflection off of Buzz's helmet (and even stated, as a compliment, \"They didn't have to do that!\"). The toys, the settings, everything was beautifully rendered and still looks good today. Even if one just reduced this picture to its visual qualities (inadvisable), they would still come out quite satisfied.Today officially marks the 20 year anniversary of when I saw this film (December 22nd, 1995), and it's high time I got to writing a review of it. \"Toy Story\" absolutely changed movies, and that is not a hyperbole. It's popularity made others realize the financial potential in computer animation. It's quality made everyone realize just what computer animation could (and should) pull off, both in visuals and storytelling. Pixar themselves would start a very long winning streak of highly acclaimed pictures, with many seemingly getting even more glowing reviews then the picture before it (heck we've gotten two great \"Toy Story\" sequels to boot). That this film still holds up even though many envelope pushing animated pictures have been released since is impressive indeed.20 years later, \"Toy Story\" still rocks!"], ["Toys, a symbol of our childhood", "This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters.This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere.1 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A good start to Pixar's film studio", "TOY STORY was a classic film from the beginning and it still is today known for being the very first CGI feature film.This was also the first film that was produced by Pixar Animation Studios and you already know the plot, so I don't have to explain it. The story is amazing and it took four creative screenwriters to write a good animated comedy film and it was just awesome to bring on screen.Do I really want to talk about this film so much? No. The acting in the film is cool and I think Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did great jobs as Woody and Buzz Lightyear and there are other voice actors including Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts and Jim Varney as Slinky Dog and they all do great jobs in their performances.The music by David Newman is really amazing and the Oscar song, \"You Got a Friend in Me\", has been known as the Toy Story film series' theme song and it is performed by David Newman. The editing and animation looks very amazing and so fantastic and spectacular that I can't stop watching this film.The characters and setting is really amazing and just cool. The film is just really cool, from beginning to end and it is just fantastic.So, overall, I love TOY STORY and everyone loves this film and this is a film that kids can grow up with. 10/10."], ["Great movie! Wrote this for English 120! Check it out!", "Have you ever wondered if toys come alive when you aren't looking? Well, the movie Toy Story answers just that!This movie has me by my heart strings. Growing up when I was a wee lad of small age and stature. I had grown in love with toys. As all small boys I imagined them being alive. So you can assume when I was a child and saw Toy Story for the first time I was off my rocker and was enamored with this glorious depiction of toys being alive. My childish mind had loved the idea of toys being alive and all the way till today. This movie is a part of me and my childhood. I have a whole box of toy story figures to prove it.The film starts in a small boy's room, named Andy. It is a regular day in 1995 I'm assuming. Cardboard boxes are set up to look like an old western town. Woody, a cowboy doll and one of the main characters, voiced by Tom Hanks, is \"sheriff\" in the town. Andy is playing with his toys and pretending Hamm, a piggy bank is wreaking havoc upon the town. And Woody is there to stop him.Within the first two minutes of the film, you have tasted the whole buffet of what you're getting yourself into. A story driven adventure with toys. The toys are lively, relatable and moody. The two main characters are complete opposite in all aspects. There's Woody, a sheriff cowboy, aged with years of play and kind of an old outdated toy, complete with a pull string that says \"There's a snake in my boot.\" Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, is a space ranger of star command. He is updated with all new bells and whistles complete with a \"karate chop action,\" a laser pointer, and he glows in the dark. The antagonist is the next door neighbor kid, Sid. A creatively destructive boy that likes to blow stuff up.When Buzz shows up unannounced, and threatens Woody's \"spot on the bed\" Woody is determined to get rid of him. And what ensues is a wonderful plot that is carried on with lively, entertaining characters. Supporting characters are just as special and well thought out. Mr. Potato Head, is based on the actual toy Mr. Potato head. He, of course is mad at the world and generally grumpy, probably due to the fact he gets his face knocked off many times throughout the film. Slinky, is based on the slinky with a twist of being a dog. His character is rustier and offers the maturity compared to the rest. Rex, a toy tyrannosaurus, is silly, clumsy, and the comedy relief. Hamm, a piggy bank, is the witty, one liner, know it all. Bo Peep, a doll shepherd and the love interest in the movie. Although this plays a very small role in the movie. Sarge is a veteran small plastic army man, who leads a small battalion of little green army men. Lastly there is RC, who is a remote controlled toy vehicle. He doesn't say any words in the movie except his \"revs\" he does to communicate with the others.The lovable characters, and beautiful voice acting come from a diverse cast of celebrities and voice actors. The movie also pays close attention to detail to everything you expect and more! I've seen this movie over the years, well over 15 or 20 times. Each time I watch, I notice something new. For instance, I noticed some of the adult jokes in the movie earlier I had not gotten. In one of the scenes Mr. Potato Head gets frustrated and removes his mouth and touches his butt with them. As an innocent child I had disregarded this gesture as something else but in retrospect I now know that he was implying the saying \"kiss my ass\" which made me laugh out loud the first time I had gotten it. I had been so naive and innocent before. And now watching the movie with my adult \"glasses\" I have gotten a whole new look of the movie. Makes me love it even more. When it offers something to the parents as well, you know you're making an excellent movie.My critiques are few and probably nit-picky. This movie is a well- rounded film and I don't have much to complain about. First off, I wish some of the supporting characters had more screen time to flesh out their personalities even more. I loved the interactions they had and I was sad to see there wasn't much of them throughout the film. Owning the Blu-Ray version of the film made me spot some technical animation errors as well. No film is without errors of course but I thought I'd mention them. The toys' feet seem to shake a tad when they walk and they seem to awkwardly float a little above the ground at times. Also the facial animations can get a bit funky and odd at times. I have no idea how difficult it is to make facial expressions animations on computer software, but I'll give them credit where credit is due. They did a fantastic job and I applaud them.I am no expert on films, but I am just an average joe. A joe that knows a good entertaining movie when he sees one. There is probably more errors or more critiques that I haven't mentioned or noticed but to me the film is as good as it needs to be. To be a kid friendly toy adventure. If you're a kid at heart, I'd still recommend this movie to you. Your inner child will thank you. I know I'll be watching this one for many years to come."], ["A childhood favourite", "Toy Story is one of those movies which holds a lot of good childhood memories for me. I first saw it in the cinema as a child, it was then worn out on VHS tape. Played to death on DVD & is now owned on special edition Blu Ray. It is by far, one of my favourite ever movies. Everything about this movie is perfect. It is a subject which is relateable to every single person who has ever watched this film; that our toys came to life when weren't there. In Toy Story the toys don't just simply come to life, they have their own world, their own relationships, their own problems and conflicts. But above all else they have friendship, loyalty & a special togetherness.The story begins with the Toys in Andy's bedroom. It is the day of Andy's birthday party and the toys gather round anxious awaiting the news as to whether a new toy has been given as a birthday present, and if it is to be Andy's new 'favourite toy'. The toy that is handed over as a present is the brand spanking new, space ranger, Buzz Lightyear. All the other toys are all in awe of him, all toys that is, expect for Woody, Andy's current favourite Toy. Woody feels threatened by Buzz and has no patience when Buzz genuinely believes that he is a real space ranger & not a toy. The story progresses sending the toys on an adventure which is like no other seen before!The casting for Toy Story is simply perfect. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen put in fantastic performances as Woody & Buzz. The relationship they create is so believable and they develop fantastic chemistry throughout the film. The best thing about Toy Story is the way it manages to involve you in the film. It makes you feel all of the toys emotions & really makes you feel for them. But at the end of the day they are just toys! We shouldn't get that involved yet somehow we do!Toy Story has many hidden meanings and gestures which really drive home the message of friendship and love. They are not cheesy, they are touching and realistic. This is what Disney do so well, they make children's films but whilst doing so they create them so they can be related to by adults.The animation is also on the money, this movie is almost 20 years old but looks as good today on Blu Ray as any other animation. Toy Story also has one brilliant soundtrack with several songs which will stay with you long after you have watched it. Overall I cannot recommend this film enough and I would recommend anybody to go and watch it, no matter what your age.A timeless classic. 10/10"], ["The Best Animated Movie of All Time", "1995's Toy Story is a work of pure imagination. It covers topics of fantasy, friendship and jealousy. It also contains relatable characters which shines out compared to other animated films. The actors were perfectly cast (Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz - the list goes on...) and the intricate plot can be compared to some of the best movies ever. I think everyone in the world has seen Toy Story, but if you haven't, it's a must see. Its by far superior to its two sequels, but they are decent. Not only is it a great film, it is historically significant, as it was the first fully 3D animated film. You HAVE TO SEE THIS...

We started with a simple yet powerful plot about a toy cowboy doll who is on top of his game,admiration and respect from his fellow toys as well as the unconditional love he has from his owner,Andy.However this has changed,only for temporary when his owner brought in a new toy that he had just got as a birthday present,a space superhero action figure and due to his arrival ,the space superhero did got every thing of admiration and love that the cowboy once have that the cowboy was always sidelined from everything.This thus turned into an outrage of jealousy that the cowboy and the space superhero ended up getting into a conflict so severe that he got pushed out of the window so that his beloved owner would not find him,however it was lucky that the space superhero survived and thus another fight occurs this time in the petrol station.They then went onto a pizza delivery truck where their owner was there and ended up again being held captive by a cruel,yet troubled neighbor named Sid who just loves to torture toys every day.And together as they were held captive,they then have to come in terms to work together in order to save themselves from the captive they were in and also to get back to their owner who they then realized have love them unconditionally,Andy which is by far one of the most realistic plot I've ever come across,though it is viewed in a toy's perspective. The movie themes itself was also powerful itself.Though it is a kids movie,it deals with themes of jealousy,abduction,cruelty and suicide as well of positive themes of leadership,cooperation,love and friendship.It is a movie that plays well with every theme so well that it deserves to be praised to its highest point.It was a movie of all genre,from horror to action to comedy and to being inspirational at all claims which most movies did not have these days.Today,we do have the various types of CGI animated movies,from the ultra good (The Incredibles,How To Train Your Dragon,Monsters Inc) to the mediocre(Rise of The Guardians,Cars,Over The Hedge,Wreck It Ralph) the ultra bad( Frozen,Brave,Turbo,Antz,Chicken Little,Shark Tale ),but none can ever come to the touch of magic that Toy Story did left in many people's hearts.Also Toy Story is also the biggest reason to every animation student on why they wanted to study animation especially 3D at the first place.Without Toy Story we would not even think that taking a leap to animation would be really very possible for many aspiring animators and film directors of that line.Overall,Toy Story,which is honesty the first animated film that I grew up watching in my life(I was four a that time), was the first that I grew up loving everything from the movie.It it quite strange that it is only later that I've realized that this hugely influential movie was released at the same year that I was born,1995 which has then installed the love of animation towards me and my whole life.And it is when I've watched this movie is that I've decided on what I've wanted to do entirely ,directing an animated movie that is as groundbreaking as Toy Story. Overall,in my personal words,it is very tough to pen a review on a movie that you've loved so much in your life and has made a great impact on your career path.Personally ,Toy Story is an amazing film that was not over-hyped,but rather talked due to its legacy and greatness from everything it has,thus it should be remembered by many generations to come.Finally,I would like to thank John Lasseter,Ed Catmull and also whoever who has been involved in the production of this wonderful movie for opening the doors to many aspiring animators out there that anyone can live the legacy that Walt Disney did formerly"], ["Best Toy Story Movie", "This movie is funny, hilarious, humorous1 It makes the whole wide world wanna laugh!

All of the toys except for Rex (the T. Rex toy). I did enjoy the toon Rex - he was quite the comedy act. Mr. Potato Head was OK in the film but I never liked the toy as a kid - just boring to play with.

I kept telling myself, in 1995, that I was witnessing something equally ground-breaking and historically important.  And who knows, maybe I was. The four historic films I alluded to above were `The Jazz Singer', `Flowers and Trees', `Becky Sharp' and `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', only the last of which has any claim to being a classic.  `Toy Story' has no great claim, either.  In retrospect it was nothing new, just another instance of Hollywood's current infatuation with computer-generated images: pleasant, light and unremarkable.Computer animation is really a soulless device and, although I found it enjoyable, this is a soulless movie.  To begin with the animation wasn't quite ripe.  Toys, I suppose, are easy to animate: but when the flesh-and-blood children start to look as if they're also made of plastic, when the whole world seems to be made of plastic, the eye longs in vain for something else.Perhaps including children at all was a mistake.  A Hans Andersen toy story, a story that concerned toys and only toys, would have been more fun (and more moving).  The film betrays itself when it starts to think of the children.  The two central characters, after all, are BAD toys - horribly gimmicky devices that children very sensibly lose interest in after not so sensibly getting their parents to buy them some other worthless gimcrack. When Woody gave his speech about how important they really were in servicing a child's dreams and wishes and whatnot ... did anyone really fall for it? It would have been much more honest if he'd said, every toy for himself, kids be damned.I'm sorry if I sound overly critical - as I said, I liked it, so for me at least the slightly sour taste wasn't strong enough to ruin the film.  John Lasseter deserves credit for taking a formulaic buddy tale and breathing genuine life into it.  (All the more credit with a medium as unyielding as computer animation.)  `Toy Story' is pleasant and fun.  But frankly, every single traditionally animated film Disney has made from 1989 on, with the possible exception of `The Hunchback of Notre Dame', is better.  And - sorry to close with a carp - did Randy Newman really have to break into song so often?  Wasn't it enough for him to write the score, without croaking his songs out over it?"], ["Not one of my favorites", "After hearing about the success of the toy story series, a rented a DVD which had a collection of Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc. I loved Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 but I did not enjoy Toy Story 1 even that much. These were the points that I didn't like in the movie: 1) In the starting, when Andy is shown playing with the toys, he starts to get a bit annoying after he keeps on playing with it. His love for the toys throughout the film bugged me after a while. But I did not find this too boring as even my cousin is a great fan of Spiderman and keeps buying and playing with the toys.2) The animation looked a bit faded in the movie. But I didn't pay much attention towards it giving an excuse that it was made in 1995 and compared to Finding Nemo and the other new movies, its animation would be a bit duller.3) Sorry Tom Hanks, but I found your character quite annoying in the film as you kept screaming like a mad character and I did not like you that much.4) Woody's girlfriend in the movie had a terrible voice. I expected a cute shepherdess's voice to be more cute and sweet rather that being a bit rough and sounding like the second woman in a love story.5) Mr.Potato head and the other characters, except for the spring dog, really annoyed me when they were reluctant to listen to Woody. I mean, why couldn't they just wait and understand him.6) The bad boy removed some parts of his toys to make them look terrible. But towards the end, when the toys help Woody and Buzz, Woody thanks them and just leaves. Why didn't he tell the toys to leave that stupid place and run away with them? They should have included these characters in the second film, at least.7) Toys had lives in the movie. So why did they not just start living alive with the humans? Why do they fall still when their masters came? They could play alive with them.The movie had some good points too. Here are some of them: 1) Tim Allen has done a fantastic voicing as Buzz, and I liked Buzz in the movie as he was shown brave, his voicing was done well and he didn't bore me at all.2) The dog who supported Woody was cute and I liked him, just, I liked him, in the movie.3) The movie was different from other movies, as here, toys were shown as the protagonists.4) The dinosaur was funny and his character uplifted the film.Overall, I don't think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies. But its the people's choice and if they wish that it would be in the top 250, then I can do nothing but give my review on the film."], ["Good and groundbreaking", "Good and groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie that delivers but does not reach a higher level due to the animation itself not having the \"warmth\" of the drawing style classic Disney animations.Still,the computer style here is very promising and quite impressive.Good story and script.A good solid start in a new trend in animation production.Very good voice acting.Only for fans of kids movies.....6 out of 43 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Toy Story", "Afraid this doesn't really hold up that well. You hear so much about great wit, but that comes only in short fits, a few good lines here and there. I know they're toys, but the characters in \"Toy Story\" largely suffer from the sort of super-quirk \"Juno\" and \"Little Miss Sunshine\" and the lot suffer from. It's basically really quirky toys talking to each other and facing acts of villainy and committing acts of heroism for an hour and a half. The animation is impressive considering when it was made but unlike hand-drawn animation from the old Disney films it HAS dated, and noticeably, often looking like a video game cutscene now. The voice work is fine, but there's just nothing truly interesting about this world or these characters. It's a pleasant enough movie and occasionally very fun, but the overwhelming affection for it seems to me the result of nostalgia and memory rather than any lasting value. Compared to the rip-roaring adventure of \"The Incredibles\", the spine-tingling melancholy tone and sophisticated ideas of \"WALL-E\", or the sense of longing and loss and adventure in \"Up\", \"Toy Story\" falls short. Very short. In fact, I'd much rather take the small-town nostalgia of \"Cars\" over this. A good starting point for Pixar but nothing even remotely approaching a classic.2 out of 9 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Overrated", "It's a charming movie about friendship and getting along, but it's far from perfect.

The only thing I wouldn't have known was the future story of Apple Inc.This is a wonderful one hour advertisement where you can see branded toys. The only thing that is original in this one hour waste is the way Steve Jobs' employees created a toy universe. It was so yesterday to create a new line of cheap plastics than do some silly adventure. It was called an adventure so people won't have any issue leaving the children alone for one or two hours of advertisements. It sounds so much more educative to have cartoon adventure instead of having cartoon characters selling you stuff. And, instead of a real actor, the cartoon has precisely zero morals: it can sell plutonium to a 5 year old or to some radical terrorist group without blinking. Unless the art director thinks the blink would raise the quantity at least 10 percent.Now about the creative part. Steve Jobs' employees never bothered to create something like say Hanna-Barbera. They just pushed older toys into this new advertisement. And here's where the creativity ends.What's even better is the world imagined. A world where children are isolated. Where they depend on their branded toys. And watch out for the bad kid! He is real creative. But the toys are working together to bring back what the lower case 'c' in a circle meant: a toy identical with million others on the shelves. Oh! And don't forget!

The story starts with a child named Andy whose favorite toy is a cowboy sheriff named, Woody (voice by Tom Hanks), and their inseparable bond. For years, Woody is Andy's number one toy, until one birthday Andy is given a new play pal, Buzz Lightyear, (voice by Tim Allen). Immediately, Woody is aware that Buzz is taking his place as the favorite toy and becomes jealous. Woody's plan to get rid of Buzz eventually leads to the both of them being far away from home and in the hands of Sid, the child toy terrorizer who lives next door. In the end, the two work together and make it back to Andy's house. Woody realizes that he will not always be Andy's favorite and becomes friends with Buzz. The overall theme of the film is accepting change and understand that sometimes it is a good thing. Woody was so worried about being replaced that he did not see a good person (toy rather) in Buzz. The next-door neighbor kid, Sid, also learned a valuable lesson in this film. He spent all of his time torturing and destroying toys as a way of having fun, but finally got what was coming to him when he seen that toys come to life. Another teachable moment was with Mr. Potato Head; one of Andy's toys, and his trust issues with Woody. Throughout the film, Mr. Potato Head constantly lacked faith in Woody and always gave a negative comment about what Woody wanted to do. Once Woody and Buzz teamed up, the other toys and Mr. Potato Head were convinced that Woody was right. Out of everyone, Buzz learned the biggest lesson; never give up on your dreams. Buzz did not comprehend that he was not really a space ranger and could not r fly. When Woody told Buzz that he was just a toy, Buzz did not believe it until he saw the commercial. Yet, he still got to ride his rocket and fly through the skies. Watching Toy Story and all of the messages that it displayed reminded me of one of my favorite films Dead Presidents. Everyone is going through the same journey, but have a different perspective on the situation. All of the characters have a diverse outcome of the lesson and they take an important life learning experience with them. The film was strictly a kid's movie, so the lighting was very bright and colorful. This worked well with the theme, because what easily influences kids are the things they see and hear. Having those cheerful images and giving a positive insight helps the children understand messages in a fun way. Many of the angles in the film were close ups of the characters faces, giving you great detail of the animated work done by the editors. Every expression was shown as if they were real people, and you could almost feel what the characters were going through. Andy's happy face, Sid's mean face and Buzz's sad face; all right there so you could relate to the emotion. I think it is cute and inspiring to young children to receive a good message in any film. Animated films have always been seen as funny and playful, but they do teach a lesson at some point. It may not be major, but it tells the audience something that they want to put out there, and most of the time that one message can grow into many different opinions; not everyone thinks the same."], ["Pixar's overall #1 best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well", "Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December 1995 every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside.

The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape.Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again.For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally \"Reaching for the sky\". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events.Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others.It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts \"You are a toy\". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style.The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation.This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...?"], ["Good, Creative charm for kids and adults!", "I'm not a huge fan of animated films, so coming into Toy Story I had very low expectations. At first, I thought it was Meh. Then, as the movie progressed it got better and better. Buzz is funny, Woody is a good cowboy, Sid is awesomely evil. Toy Story has an amazing cast as well. I mean, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, AND the Amazing Don RICKLES as Mr. Potato Head! Toy Story keeps kids and adults on their feet and I'm praising it so much because I have never seen any ANIMATED film as good as Toy Story so far. Disney really worked their magic into this classic.

It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too.

In toy story, a boy with many toys but does not have heart to treat toys dearly is suppose to be punished. This suggests the situation of modern society, and reminds us the importance to treat things carefully. Another point that I like in this film is, the growth of the cowboy. When he meets Buzz for the first time, he did not accept Buzz, because he couldn't understand everything about Buzz. Moreover, his position was taken over because of Buzz's appearance. However, he learns the importance of understanding other people, through the adventure to return to home. Also, Buzz finally comes to understand Woody.

In 1995, John Lasseter released a mega hit upon the world with one of the best computer animated movies of all time. It launched a huge career for the studio, dropping hit after hit even to this day. This is the story of a toy named Woody (Tom Hanks), a Cowboy Sheriff toy with a pull string voice box. He is owner Andy's favorite toy. But Andy gets a new toy in the form of a space ranger named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who actually believes he is Buzz, not a toy. Woody starts to feel left out and replaced.

The 2 toys adventure together eventually leads them to neighbor Sid's house, where the must escape before Sid's favorite pastime of blowing up toys turns on them. This movie was a pure stroke of genius. It showed off the technology computers could all have, and what the future of animation could be. Choosing toys as the focus was smart, because the animation was still fairly new, and therefore still a little plastic looking. So toys, which should look artificial, seemed to look decent. The voice acting in this movie is fantastic too. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen play well off each other and provide great characters. Woody's jealousy and angry outbursts contrasts well with Buzz's conceited yet naive nature. The supporting cast give great performances as well, and allow the toys to each have their own distinct personalities which, when put together, make them feel like a family. The soundtrack of this movie was done by Randy Newman, who made one the most sugary songs that I love. \"You Got a Friend in Me\" is known by most, as it is the quintessential Toy Story song. It is like a theme song to everything this movie is. The ultimate friendship between a human and his toys, but also between two life- long buddies. This movie promoted love, imagination, and friendship. It was a kids film that adults could relate to. It was everything that Pixar continues to stand on today. And everyone should see it. I give this film a 10/10. PS: Because this is Pixar, I gotta mention the good luck charm. In this film John Ratzenberger plays Hamm, the piggy bank. He's a fun character with good quips.

I am one of them. The animation is of course crude by today's standards, but it was made in a way that makes it seem like 1995 wasn't that long ago. As dated as it looks, we can still appreciate it for being more than just a test of what computers could render. As for complaints, the jokes could have been funnier and the story could have less instances of convenience, like how Buzz and Woody enter the Pizza Planet Truck and come across a nice, high pile of pizza boxes to hide behind. There were also some errors in the anatomy of some toys, like RC. I won't take points off for the animation because hey, it was 1995 and Pixar had up to that point only been making shorts for 11 years, so it isn't something to grouch over (even though there were some superficial glitches like disappearing lights between scenes). All I can say is, see it soon and brace for a higher intrigue of the early history of CGI."], ["Great start to a great trilogy", "The beginning of a sensational trilogy , I think this is the weakest of the trilogy , more does not mean it is bad , quite the contrary , it's great movie, who would say that dolls speakers would so sure , the history of this is great , it's funny , the double Woody and Buzz is very good at the beginning Woody has envy him to be best friends, Sid movie villain is cruel , you feel a giant hatred for him , we have other characters , the soundtrack is excellent, the voice work is amazing , the brilliant Tom Hanks who is the voice of Woody , Woody scene trying to escape from Sid's house is very good and fun (remember some prison movies) , Toy Story is a classic animation, and deserves to be seen by all.

Toy Story is about a boy named Andy and his love for his toys. Andy's favorite toys have a huge secret that he is not aware of, they are actually alive and become real when no one is around. Andy has a favorite toy cowboy named Woody who is the Sheriff and leader of all the other toys. Woody pride himself on being Andy's favorite toy, but that title is challenged when Andy has a birthday party and receives a new space ranger toy Buzz Light Year. In the scene that introduces Buzz Light Year, it is kind of symbolic that the new toy may be a replacement for the old cowboy Woody. As the kids rush in the room the day of Andy's birthday party Woody is thrown under the bed, and Buzz Light Year is placed on the bed in Woody's spot.Time goes by as Randy Newman's song \"You got a friend in me\" plays as the soundtrack during various scenes as Andy becomes more involved with Buzz, eventually pushing Woody to the background. The lyrics to the song could be considered an ironic montage to the mood that Woody feels during these scenes, because he is lonely and feels replaced. Buzz on the other hand is indulging in the admiration that he receives from Andy. The soundtrack to this movie as awesome, because the lyrics of the songs played like, \"you got a friend in me\", \"strange things\", and \"pop goes the weasel\". Those songs can replace the dialogue in the scenes and the audience will still be able to follow on.At Pizza Planet there is some tension between the two toys Buzz and Woody, which causes them to end up with the neighbor kid Sid, who is known to destroy his toys. Once the movie reaches this climax the characters positions change. Woody and Buzz are forced to reconcile and work together in the quest to return home.The special effects and graphics used in this animation were phenomenal. The camera angles, digital character movements, even facial expressions, helped bring the toys in the film to life. Although this film theme was surrounded by the dynamic relationship between alpha toys Woody and Buzz Light Year. The supporting characters, the relationships displayed between Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the comedic scenes with Rex the Dinosaur and Slinky the Dog made the film more entertaining and realistic. Toy Story is a must see film for all children who has a love for toys. Watching this film will enhance a new found respect for the creativity of children's imagination."], ["The Movie that changed everything....", "This was perhaps what you would get when you combine toys in cartoons with writing from Fox's King of the Hill. The acting's great, the writing's great, and the characters are great, except the toy destroyer. But at least karma bit Sid really badly when his mutant toys turned the tables on him. I was impressed by the characters in this movie, the toy jokes are great in the movie, even the innuendo is used correctly. Even the way the toys interact like human beings in the film, makes it feel like you're watching real people instead of characters and toys.I was mostly impressed by the story, the way it was written. It's not written out like a little kid's imagination, it's well written, it's funny, it's emotional, and the best part, in the 50's, when Sputnik was launched, astronauts stole the spotlight from Cowboy westerns. Even the score's really great, I enjoyed the score even the songs, my only complaint was the Ms. Nesbitt routine, once Buzz came to his senses and helped Woody, the scene proved to be not really that funny.The cast was great, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Wallace Shawn, Jim Varney, John Ratzenburger, Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Morris, Erik Von Detten, everyone was great in the film, they sound believable and likable.In conclusion, Toy Story not only gives us a moral to learn when Woody and Buzz became the best of friends, when it comes to life, there is no favorite, all that matters that Woody and Buzz and all your favorite toys will be there for Andy when he needs him. And nothing could test Buzz and Woody's friendship............just wait."], ["Still Pixar's Best for me!!!", "After all of Pixar's feature-length masterpieces, (Finding Nemo, The Incredibles etc.) \"Toy Story\" still manages to be not only my favorite Pixar film but one of my favorite films of all time.

Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, the Green Army Men, Andy, Sid, and the entire toy community are all fleshed out characters that always have something witty or insightful to say about the situations they find themselves in. All in all, \"Toy Story\" will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the first Pixar film I saw and held the most immediately memorable characters.

A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom.

Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all?

The central characters are Andy's toys, who are led by a cowboy action figure named Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who is apparently Andy's favorite toy. Woody and the other toys feel seriously threatened when Andy receives a space action figure called Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) for his birthday. Immediate antagonism materializes between Woody and Buzz when Woody feels he might be replaced in Andy's heart, but Woody and Buzz are forced to bond and actually become friends when they become prisoners of Andy's next door neighbor, Sid, a sadistic little kid who likes to torture toys.This deliciously imaginative story works thanks to a brilliant screenplay that brings vivid and believable emotions to toys, effectively showcasing the world from a toy's point of view. The jealousy and resentment between Woody and Buzz rings completely true and is actually the glue that keeps this story moving. Though the story provides consistent laughs, there are a couple of poignant moments as well...watch when Andy stops sleeping with Woody, who gets demoted from Andy's bed to the toy box or watch when Buzz sees a commercial for himself and finally realizes that he is a toy and is not real.As always with Disney animated films, the voice casting is perfection, with standout work from Hanks, whose work here rivals the voice work of Robin Williams in Aladdin...he makes us love and care for Woody and puts us in his corner from jump. Mention should also be made of Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as a very insecure toy dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as a piggy bank named Ham, and R. Lee Ermey as a toy soldier. Really liked Annie Potts as a Little Bo Peep doll too, though I just couldn't get past my trouble with the fact that a little boy would own a Little Bo Peep doll, but I did not allow this to deter my enjoyment here.Randy Newman contributed a couple of nice songs to the film, one of which, \"You've Got a Friend\", received an Oscar nomination. John Lasseter's direction and his contribution to the Oscar nominated screenplay are the final touches to this entertaining adventure that actually conjured up images of Spielberg work like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, and though the story does have a couple of extra endings, it is a richly entertaining fantasy adventure that had me laughing and smiling throughout the entire running time."], ["A personal favorite", "I've watched this film since I was a kid, and 20 years since it's release it remains as not just one of the best animated films but one of the best overall films ever made. As long as I can remember this has been my favorite movie. Everything from the music, visuals, story telling, and voice acting was at it's peak at the time. Animation has come a long way and I believe it's one of the most important films ever created. It was the first of many smash hits from Pixar and it paved the way for other successful animated films since. This is a film that anyone can enjoy and it will continue to remain a classic as time goes on.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["On it's 20th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!", "In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help.They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as \"Toy Story\", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about.First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the \"I'm Mrs Nesbitt\" sequence and the \"You Are A Toy\" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies \"You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic \"To Infinity and Beyond\" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history.There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs \"You've Got A Friend In Me\" and \"I Will Go Sailing No More\" hit the right notes by being memorable songs.Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school.Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon.So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday."], ["great job", "this movie was such a great family movie. My daughter absolutely loves all the toy story movies we watched every single one of them and it always gets to us. great job to the creator of the movie. I loved how my daughter reacts to the movie when her favorite part comes up. I think she seen this movie so many times she probably knows the lines already. Woody is such an awesome cowboys i think he is one of my favorite characters along with little Bo-peep and slinky. Every toy in that movie make a really good team. I thought it was mean that woody pushed buzz out the window because he was a jealous toy. But I'm glad him and buzz get along great.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Fun for all ages", "Toy Story is a classic among kids and adults, a classic among animation and simply one of the highest rated movies of all time. At first thoughts I felt yeah sure it is great but then after a little more time I came to realise this is incredible, I won't say it's 100% perfect but still it just exudes this feeling of well, fun. It's the kind of movie that only after do you really understand how Woody feels and how Buzz feels, you also realise how easy it would be to watch it again because it's really a calm but also an exciting watch. It's hard to call this a kid's movie owing to the fact that all fans of this back in the day are fully grown adults now, but the fact that they still return to this and say it is a masterpiece even today, well it shows how impressive this really is as well.The story is of course about toys, and in particular a new toy arriving because Andy the toys owner got a new Space Ranger named Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. Woody the favourite toy of Andy is jealous of Buzz's new found fame among all the other toys and starts to both feel angry but also kind of obsolete as well. The story moves along at a frantic pace, the amount of things that happen though to say this has an 81 minute run time is amazing and the timing is absolutely wonderful. Another point I found only after thinking back on the movie was the humour and how is just really good, one moment in a certain pizza restaurant arcade where we see a \"Whack-a-Alien\" game in reference to \"Alien\" sums up the overly kidult tone this movie possesses.Among the voices we have Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as a small potato toy, Wallace Shawn in his trademark voice as Rex the dinosaur toy and the smoky voice of Jim Varney as Slinky the well, slinky toy dog. The voices are very memorable and the voice cast are perfectly picked, none seem out of place and maybe that is because of how much this movie has dug itself into film culture. I found Hanks and Allen's voices to be at the same level as each other only because they are both so great, Buzz is made even more courageous sounding by Allen and Hanks provides a kind of cool kind of toy voice but also brings out Woody's scared side or angry side well.John Lasseter the director is among many names behind this movie who seem to all hit the right spot with this, they create the first animated feature length picture and turn it into one of the still most popular of them all. The writers hit the movie from another flank, Lasseter brings humour out from his vision but I think the writers, Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow really bring another face to the movie where the humour but also the emotion can mix really well. As animation goes it of course does not look as it maybe did back then (still isn't bad though), although it doesn't matter anyway because it is the storytelling that blows you away and the characters really grab your attention.Pixar kicked off their stellar works in animated movies in style and brought not only a new way of making a movie, but also a fine way of telling a story and not making it over the top or just for kids, this is for everyone. There isn't too much too find wrong with this I mean, maybe some of the jokes aren't great, but really they may be still good anyway, it is kind of a movie that you can easily watch again without feeling it will quickly become boring, the kind of movie that is fun for quite literally, all the family."], ["Best for Kids!!!", "This movie is one of the best movie for Kids as it has a great story with a great message.

There will be spoilers ahead:I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here.I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone.That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons.The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, \"You've Got a Friend In Me\", which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film.The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years.This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended."], ["G.o.a.t", "I loved this film.

It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens.

The story is amazing and it took four creative screenwriters to write a good animated comedy film and it was just awesome to bring on screen.Do I really want to talk about this film so much? No. The acting in the film is cool and I think Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did great jobs as Woody and Buzz Lightyear and there are other voice actors including Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts and Jim Varney as Slinky Dog and they all do great jobs in their performances.The music by David Newman is really amazing and the Oscar song, \"You Got a Friend in Me\", has been known as the Toy Story film series' theme song and it is performed by David Newman. The editing and animation looks very amazing and so fantastic and spectacular that I can't stop watching this film.The characters and setting is really amazing and just cool.

Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history.The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having \"souls\" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well).

Such a great blend of animation, characters and story. A classic that I keep watching over and over again - mostly synchronized to local languages. Still, guys who did the voice-overs did a great job. A rather simple story, but spiced with so much details. It also covers many views of childhood, kids' imagination, family and yes - it brings messages about friendship, jealousy and trust. Every single toy got character and is equipped with specific character attributes: one big toy is actually sensitive, another is grumpy and cynical, then there is a toy not realizing it's actually a toy and so on. There is not a single boring part. Houmor suits both kids' and adults' sense and there is a plenty of intelligent details about toys features.

Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation.Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody.The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife).Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995."], ["Fantastic animated movie for all ages.", "Toy Story is a fantastic animated movie for all ages.

It was a thoroughly enjoyable film and i think it had all the qualities of a classic. There are some things that i think can be improved on and that's why this film can only get 9 from me Firstly i would like to question who really is the bad guy in this film? is it Sid a lonely boy who only has a faithful dog as a friend. Or is it Andy who as soon as he gets a new toy seems to disregard a toy that he had had for years and (spoiler) that turns out to be a collectible item in the next film and would pocket the family quite a lot of money. I think the latter is the true bad guy in this film.I think this film is ground breaking in the way it tackles real life issues like buzz's tendency to dress up as Mrs Nesbitt. the film is very accepting of this and it shows Mrs Nesbitt having a tea party showing that whoever you are you can always get enough friends for a tea party.It is hard to put this film into a certain genre but if i had to choose i would say it is a thriller. the way that as soon as the children are out the room the toys come to life is quite chilling. when Woodys head spins round when he is talking to the films hero Sid at the end is one of the films many intense moments.This film is full of major plot twists like at the end where its Christmas and Andy gets a Mrs potato head. i just didn't see it coming. i was sat in my living room in utter silence when that Revelation came. I was almost speechless. i wasn't completely speechless but almost.one of my favourite moments in the film is the horrific fight scene between woody and buzz. you just don't know whats gonna happen next. One thing missing from this fight scene was a corny catchphrase before punching each other like \"play with this?\" I think Pixar tell a story and have a meaning behind everything they do when Buzz flys at the end it just proves that you can do anything if you believe and after watching this film this is the way I'm going to live my life. I just want to make sure that every moment is lived to the fullest.I was quite surprised that woody and buzz became friends in the end because both characters had said some hurtful things and I'm not sure if it is believable that they could both just get past this and call it all water under the bridge.If you do get chance watch this film because it is based on real events and i think it gives people a good view of evidence on how to catch your toys out and make sure they don't go on any adventures while you are not looking.To recap please go and watch this film. you really are missing out."], ["Absolutely Love Toy Story!", "Toy Story is an incredibly creative, fun film with a touching, heartfelt story.

I'm sure that there were many films I had passively experienced beforehand, but this picture was the first time I found myself engaged in the experience. It was the first one to actually catch my attention, as well as the first that I actually enjoyed. Nearly two decades later, it still holds up in my eyes. While I still occasionally watch other features from my childhood, none of them ever take me back like Toy Story manages to do every single time, and while my opinion of a lot of them changed over the years, Toy Story has always been ten stars, and one of the few I've grown to appreciate even more so as my tastes matured.But this movie has managed to best the test of time so far in other ways too. Nearly two decades later and most of the movie still looks beautiful. The now dated animation techniques being used at a few points and the slightly \"shiny\" human character models are noticeable on occasion, but they're all forgivable thanks to the focus on the toys and interiors rather than the people and the outdoors. But even in scenes where those two are central, such as the ending sequence with Buzz and Woody following the moving truck, you find yourself paying no attention to them because you're so engrossed in what's going on in the tightly written narrative that you can't pick apart the trivial things.All in all, Toy Story is a movie that's stood the test of time for me and an entire generation, and will likely find itself being watched for decades to come and, to quote Buzz Lightyear, \"To infinity, and beyond!\""], ["Greatest childhood memory", "This movie reminds me of my childhood.

It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1995 and was like the first fully computer animated movie, while nowadays almost all the animated movies we see are computer animated rather than the old days when they were digitally animated drawings. I miss those old cartoon movies. Anyway, Toy Story is definitely a classic movie. Kids today can watch the movie, and it probably won't seem like an old movie to them. They have made other Toy Story movies which seemed to earn more money than the first one. But, I will talk about why the first one is the best. The first one introduced us to the Toys in Toy Story, yeah they add some new toys in the later films, but this one is the first real introduction. It's always nice to remember the introduction of the characters we are familiar with in later films. Also, the later films seem to be more about adventures from the toys we know together in a group, in this movie it was mostly just the adventure of our favorite toys, Woody and Buzz. We see Woody's reaction to having Buzz as the new popular toy. Also, this one seems more about survival for Woody and Buzz, while in the other Toy Story movies it seems like it's less about survival and more about getting back to where they belong. Another reason to like this movie, from what I know while Pizza Planet is mentioned in other Pixar movies, this is the only one which shows them inside a Pizza Planet. I've always thought, that restaurant would be really cool to be at if it were a real restaurant. About Pizza Planet, I remember way back in 6th Grade in the scene when we see the Pizza Planet pick-up truck at the gas station and we hear the guys in it ask for directions to Pizza Planet, somebody in the classroom asked the teacher why would somebody who worked at Pizza Planet be asking for directions on how to get there? My teacher didn't know how to answer. In this movie we get to know Andy's original house and his neighborhood. We get to know the villain in this movie, Sid. The villains in the other movies are like the Chicken Man, Stinky Pete, and Lotso and some of his gang. I'm sure most of us could agree that our favorite bad guy in these Toy Story movies is Sid and let me give a few reasons to why we might like him the best. For one, Sid is Andy's next door neighbor. What's weird is the movie doesn't give any indication of whether Andy and Sid knew each other, so it can leave us with that question. Sid isn't like a bad guy, I mean he plays in the movie as a bad guy, but he seems to play a character we could imagine his age. I mean about a 13 year old boy who wears a T Shirt with a skeleton. He's aggressive and he likes torturing toys as a hobby of his, obviously not aware that the toys are alive. He likes explosives and stuff, and has a dark atmosphere in his room, along with mostly keeping his room locked. So, he's a G rated version of an early adolescent character who is supposed to be like the bad guy and he doesn't swear, talk about alcohol, drugs, or sex. He isn't like a criminal, just a scary kid with a dark atmosphere who likes to be the bad guy to toys he doesn't realize are alive. The climax in this movie also seems more exciting than the climax in the other movies. One thing we can find hard to believe, is how the toys have all these wacky adventures, doing things that somebody could easily notice, and nobody seems to be aware that the Toys are alive. Toy Story doesn't seem like The Velveteen Rabbit, but more like Toys who are having their own adventures, a little like The Lego Movie, where the Toys seem more alive than they seem like Toys. This is a great movie, I'd give a 9/10."], ["A Great Funny Movie", "I sat down to watch this movie again - and was totally blown away. It actually pretty scary for a child movie. Sid is one of the best villains I've ever seen and Woody's jealousy is really well done. The emotions and characters in the movie are complex and satisfying to watch. I can see the point of those people who complain about it being too scary for their kids - I'd say don't watch this with under five year old unless your child is a horror junkie.My sister who is five still gets scared by the scenes in Sid's room. However, overall this is one of my favorite child movies and well worth a watch, it doesn't matter how old you are.0 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A Toy in the making of another and more toys", "Excellent voice match to character in movie.

What I didn't realize at the time was what a huge step forward Toy Story was in terms of using computer technology in films. The story follows Woody, a toy cowboy, who struggles with feelings of jealousy and inadequacy in the face of Andy's new toy, Buzz Lightyear. He makes a plan to get rid of Buzz, but ultimately, when his plan backfires, the two must work together to get back to Andy. The supporting characters add a lot to the film, and I've always considered the dinosaur (Rex) a favorite of mine.

It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The \"cannibal toys\" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how \"The Claw\" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face).There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example.In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars."], ["Classic Tale Full of Imagination", "Toy Story (1995)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well. TOY STORY was ground breaking when originally released and it comes as no shock that the film hasn't lost any of its impact. The screenplay with its great characters and story is guaranteed to be enjoyed for decades to come."], ["I seen a movie quite like this one", "I saw this movie was I was about 10 years old and I was captivated.

Hollywood is notorious for taking the latest tricks and building entire movies around it, rather than using them to support a well written story.Here, where it would have been so easy to rely on the WOW factor and slap together a meaningless story, Lasseter and company chose to focus on story and character, and leave the tech to the technicians, who also seem to have a better grasp on humanity than most movie techs.These two movies (1 and 2) are part of a very short list of movies I've attended that actually got a standing ovation and applause at the end.Bravo0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"]], "A Bug's Life": [["A Bug's Life: Not Just Art, But Heart", "(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was \"dazed and exhausted\" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \"wowed\" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  \"Heck\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \"dumbing down\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?"], ["Wow.", "There is great detail in A Bug's Life.

However, as a stand-alone movie, it is difficult to fault. The characters and backgrounds are beautifully rendered but still look like computer animations. That might sound stupid but for those who think computer graphics can equal live-action, this film serves to debunk that idea. It does look good, no question, but compare this to the computer wizardry behind Gollum in the \"Lord Of The Rings\" trilogy and you'll see what I'm getting at. This is not much of a criticism though - it would be akin to disliking Scooby Doo (the series) because nobody says \"Zoinks!\" when they're scared.I must confess, I rather enjoyed this film. It is imaginative and colourful and full of zest and energy - exactly how a kids film should be. The humour is a little on the basic side (dumb insects falling into walls and references to \"poop-poop\") but again, this is what you would expect. Another reason that \"A Bug's Life\" got the cold treatment from critics was because it simply wasn't as entertaining to adults as the \"Toy Story\" films and I'm afraid I agree. But what the film lacks in cross-generational appeal, it makes up for with enthusiasm and story-telling. It does for bugs what The Flintstones did for neolithic cavemen, fitting outsiders into our own everyday lives. Flick, the rebellious ant at the centre of the story, produces telescopes out of grass and water. Piles of rubbish are portrayed as vast cities and the characters, good and bad, behave as we might. Credit for this must go to the top-notch cast of voice actors including Kevin Spacey, David Hyde Pierce, Denis Leary and the others.

Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, \"Antz\", \"A Bug's Life\" suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as \"Antz.\" The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don't build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some \"warrior\" bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus.

As far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar's sophomore effort. Sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story, nor is the animation out of this world. However, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, I could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics.There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here. Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story. Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons. He is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1. He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages.When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. Compared to Antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony. The water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. You don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production. The reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism. All the bugs are finely crafted too. The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one. It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments. While Ant Island is nice, it is just the outdoors. Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs. It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything. From the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagon\u0097complete with full nutrition guide on the side\u0097and crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades, everything is done right.As far as much of the humor, you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices. No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit. I dare you to think of someone better. Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Princess Atta, as well as the always-fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper. Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie, but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits. Yes, A Bug's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar, a tradition that has continued on. With many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout, you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast. Full of \"those guy actors,\" it is people like Richard Kind, Brad Garrett, and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.Overall, it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar, one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years, but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience. There are joyous moments, sad times, and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun.

Most of the character designs are great; I particularly liked the grasshoppers and the various circus insects. The only character design that I though was poor was the bird which is strange as it was probably the creature that looked closest to its real counterpart; perhaps that was the problem... it had no 'character' it was just a dangerous creature whereas everything else was anthropomorphised. The voice cast, which includes Kevin Spacey and a young Hayden Panettiere, do a fine job; I never though they sounded too 'cartoony'. Being rated 'U' there is little to offend here although some parents might find one or two of the gags involving the male ladybird a bit crude and there are some mildly scary moments that could possibly upset younger children."], ["brilliantly imaginative", "I thought this film was really brilliant and imaginative. Most films these days seem to lack imagination and so it is really something special when a movie possesses this quality. I did think the story was a little lame, but this was more than compensated for by the creativity of the artists who made it.   I thought it was a million times better than Antz which seems pedestrian and lacking in imagination in comparison.5 out of 5 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["One of the Most Endearing Bug Stories", "The strongest point of every Pixar movie I've seen is that they all have heart. While the excellent colourful animation has been consistent in quality, it's the soulful stories and memorable characters that we love and return to with each viewing. 'A Bug's Life' has always been on my to-watch list and I finally bought the DVD yesterday. It's already become a favourite after first viewing. The animation is beautifully detailed and the motion is brilliant. Not only are the characters wonderfully illustrated but also the background is given plenty of detail. Moreover these characters are so adorable as they are superbly brought to life that you'll fall in love with them. The voice cast that includes talents like Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Dave Foley and Richard Kind do a great job. Clearly, Pixar does not depend on stars (unlike Dreamworks) and they rather focus on the material by creating it with heart. 'A Bug's Life' is another winner from Pixar that I'll very likely be revisiting again and again.9 out of 11 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["One of the Best Animation Movie", "The first Animation movie I watched when I was child.

It could be, let's see: it's super entertaining, it has funny moments, creative bits of action and also small tender parts. The characters were built to know their place in this film, which in my personal view I would describe its plot as an \"adaptation\" (quote unquote because unofficially it is not) of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), for they both consist of a small village or colony being subjugated by invaders demanding food during each invasion, but placed in a world of an animated colony of ants; so the protagonist, Flik, comes up with a great idea, to search for a group of \"warrior\" bugs (they are in fact members of a circus) to help them defeat the invaders, a group of malicious grasshoppers whose leader may be one of the best villains Pixar's creative team has ever offered, the evil Hopper. This movie also subtly touches the idea of revolution, as the ants ultimately wish to eradicate their raiders in order to live life peacefully. Another thing worth mentioning is the clever way in which they decide to deal with the grasshoppers, and although it is met with an unfortunate mishap, the denouement of the film is utterly satisfying, just wait and see if you haven't already! \nOh, and the outtakes at the end of the movie are really ingenious and creative, not to mention funny! A great adventure that I would watch many many times, but I feel that with so many excellent films that Pixar has provided the public over the years this one may not rank as high as many others, which is why I believe that is somewhat underrated."], ["Most underrated Pixar", "Such a great film.

The DVD has two sets of these out-takes where as I?m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape. The DVD also features \"Gerry?s Game\" which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.This is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to Dreamworks? \"Antz\", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. If you look at the star voices of both films, \"Antz\" is largely cast with big name \"movie\" stars with a few familiar \"TV\" star voices, where \"A Bug?s Life\" is just the opposite, loaded with \"TV\" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.Dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with Disney, you have your work cut out for you.

The film can be very humorous at times, but can also vary on the border of being overly-goofy and in result, some jokes do fall quite flat. The animation, although not as great as its work shortly before, is quite good and full of vibrant color, which makes it very easy on the eyes. The music in the film is really good, with Randy Newman providing a stellar soundtrack, as he always does. The voice work is fairly impressive, with the circus bugs taking the lead in terms of voice work and in character development. The circus bugs are often the best part of the film, and their humor seems rather genuine and their story very engaging, unlike some tropes used earlier with the ants themselves. However, the ant Dot in the film can prove to be quite an adorable change of pace throughout, and stole the show in every scene she was in. In the end, A Bug's Life is far from Pixar's greatest work, but is a mildly enjoyable time. It has a wonderful cast of supporting characters, and is full of vibrant colors, and a score that is very easy to listen to.\nMy Rating: 8.75/103 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["One of Pixar's best movies", "This was a childhood movie of mine and needless to say it's aged well.

It doesn't help that the ants are basically enslaved to the grasshoppers led by the cruel, manipulative and sadistic Hopper (Kevin Spacey) who threatens them after Flik accidentally destroys their food supply when one of his inventions backfire.

It tells the story of a single lazy grasshopper who fiddles his summer away living for the moment while his neighbor ants work tirelessly, squirreling away massive amounts of food for the winter months. When the cold finally arrives, the starving grasshopper is reminded of his laziness and lack of preparation by the ant queen, who allows him to stay with the colony if he plays his fiddle, in a sense, working for the food and warmth he'll be provided.Disney ups the ante in \"A Bug's Life\" by pitting a grasshopper warlord and his followers against a huge colony of ants by demanding that they provide food for them on a regular basis. Noting that the ants far outnumber the grasshoppers in quantity, little Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) embarks on a series of initiatives to free the ants from domination by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and his mean crew. I've read other viewer comparisons of the movie to Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven, and that might work except in one respect. When push came to shove, it was Flik and his own ingenuity that helped win the day for Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and the colony. With more than a little help from the voiceless, colorful bird that made bird food out of Hopper.I always get a kick out of the ingenuity and cleverness that goes into these animated features and this one provided it in spades. Very colorful and well drawn, the insect characters are unique and fun, especially the 'warrior' bunch from the circus. If you liked this, you owe it to yourself to look up the original Disney Silly Symphony, as the restored version is glorious with outstanding color and first rate animation. You can't go wrong with either one."], ["Pixar's hidden gem", "When looking back at the Pixar movies, one almost seems to forget A Bug's Life. Perhaps it's the fact that another similar movie from DreamWorks called Antz came out that same year and the two are often mistaken for one another.

Either way, this was the last movie from Pixar's first few I had left to watch, and once again great animated fun was delivered.I'm happy to say that the Pixar mark was very much hit with this movie and my expectations were met. So this movie tells the story of an ant called Flik, who has to recruit \"warrior\" insects to fight off the Grasshoppers that demand double the amount of food the ants can supply. The movie really starts to get funny when the circus bugs that Flik gets as warriors (or so he thinks) come into play. Their interactions, as well as their quirks make for some very good comedic scenes. As for the main plot, the empowerment of the little ants over the mighty grasshoppers is endearing enough to pull you in.

A Bug's Life has that same charm, it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects, because even though they talk, they still ACT just like real bugs. It's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does.Honey, I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger, and to me, A Bug's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities. I try not to compare it to something like Toy Story (which I still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made), because the story of A Bug's Life is not quite as good as Toy Story's, but then again, almost nothing is. The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun.The story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society, mostly geared around building a harvest of food, most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers, vastly superior in strength and general meanness, and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter. We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food, the consequences will be dire. And incidentally, the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse-tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the \"Great Leap Forward\u0085\"The fun and excitement begins when Flik, the main character, sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers. You see, he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger, so he feels it's his responsibility, but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers. Great for the audience, not so great for the safety of the clan.The movie was released back in the late 90s, when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos, like Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and The Arrival, A Bug's Life and Antz, etc. Comparisons between A Bug's Life and Antz are inevitable, although it seems clear to me that A Bug's Life is by far the superior film, and not only because it doesn't star Woody Allen stuttering and whining through the lead role.

The season of summer for ants is probably one of the most dreaded season since all the ants have to gather food for the menacing grasshoppers where the vicious leader of the gang, Hopper (voice by Kevin Spacey), thinks of the ants as inferior slaves where at any time they could have their head squish.

There are some quite clear mistakes which suggests to me that the makers were in a hurry to churn it out as a money making project.It has to be said that the cast of characters out with the ant community are superb, very funny and very clever, but they don't appear in the film until a good while in. Up until this point, the characters are dull, bland and they all look the same. There's no creativity. Yes they are all ants but some defining features would have been nice.That being said, it is still a good film to sit and watch with the family, it's harmless, there's little to no real violence and it's not easy for films to pass that off.

Of course it's behind when you really focus on the details, but the visuals are presented so well that it keeps the viewer focused on the most intricate items on the screen, allowing the brain to ignore rendering quality and be swept up by the story.The story begins fairly childish, especially by comparison to most of Disney and Pixar's other films. If you can put up with the intro, it quickly grows into a charming story with several clever ideas and jokes. And the villains are truly menacing, which had me filled with tension hoping the ants' plans work out.

Loosely (very loosely) translated into Disney language, the grasshopper becomes the villain who forces the ant to offer him food for winter in exchange of \"protection\"\u0085 from termites or bigger ants. But the story must sustain the movie format, let's make it a colony of ants versus a gang of greedy grasshoppers, and then work on a script \u00e0 la \"Three Amigos\" and you get \"A Bug's Life\", Pixar's second film.So, if \"Toy Story\" was to 3D what \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was to traditional animation, well I guess that makes \"A Bug's Life\" a little bit like \"Pinocchio\", at least as far as chronology and technological improvement go, this comparison is valid, but while \"A Bug's Life\" didn't hold up as well as \"Toy Story\" 18 years, for the film's defense, it has nothing to do with quality. Indeed, this is a marvel of animation and entertainment and the technological accomplishment it represents says a lot about the progresses made in three years.Drawing toys is one thing and I said about \"Toy Story\" that it had the merit to put the setting in a very cozy and familiar environment instead of the usual forests and castles. In \"A Bug's Life\", we go back to the forests, but on a smaller, smaller scale and the level of detail is so phenomenal, each frame must have required a lot of hours of works and remember there are 24 frames per second, and many frames contains dozens of character, because, hey, they're insects, small creatures.\"A Bug's Life\" is the result of thousands and thousands of hard working and the animators deserve all the credit for not having surrendered to the 'easy way', during the mass scenes, I closely looked at the ants in the background, you never have the feeling of a block or repetitive shots, and from what the trivia said, they used a computer program that would animate several group of ants randomly placed in each part of the screen, and it contributes to convey a realistic mass effect. And that's how we imagine ants.Of course, the film is not just about ants but is a tribute to that underworld (literally) that inspires a constant fascination and revulsion. I hate insects but for some reason, I'm fascinated by documentaries about them as if the best way to finally look at the forms, the shapes, the colors, the interactions with other insects or the outside world or fights is to make sure they're not here. Not that \"A Bug's Life\" has a documentary-like value like the great \"Microcosmos\" but even on a documentary, I would have had a hard time enjoying the sight of cockroaches or grasshoppers. In \"A Bug's Life\", insects are cool to watch, and from their standpoints, rain doesn't play a salvation role anymore and cute birds are like scary monsters, time have changed since \"Bambi\".But if \"A Bug's Life\" had everything to please the eyes, and to entertain, so why don't we celebrate it like \"Toy Story\"'? I guess it was released too soon without having the privilege of a sequel younger audiences could appreciate, it's hard to carry a reputation when you're made just between \"Toy Story\" and \"Shrek\". And it's all justice that \"Antz\" suffers from the same fate, the two films, from rival studios were released the same year, and it's obvious there was some leak, but let's accept as a happy ending that they didn't go to court (although it did terminate some friendships) and that both did well at the box-office\u0085 but I think I would paraphrase the Emperor Joseph's quote by saying \"there were too many characters\" and I'm not saying that was the problem within the story, but about its appeal.Take the ants, they are a colony where each one has a role to play, some carry the food, some guide them etc. they can't think of individuals, except for the queen, her heiress, princess Atta (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) and her sister Dot (young Hayden Pannetiere) but apart from this podium, all ants are just ants, the one who emerges from the mass is Flik, the outcast inventor who always fail (one of his last inventions will cause the destruction of the offering for the grasshoppers, forcing them to prepare food again hence depriving themselves from winter food). Flik is an individual yet the story can't allow us to root for one individual, they're insects and they all work as group, even the mercenaries he's supposed to hire, in reality circus workers covering different personalities, there is not one to stand above.The film is a triumph in characterization and high-scale animation, but take all the movies that succeeded after \"Shrek\", \"Finding Nemo\", \"Monsters & Co\", there was a core of significant characters, Shrek and Fiona, Woody and Buzz, the more you identify with one, the more positively you respond to the spectacle. In \"A Bug's Life\", we do empathize with the ants as a whole, but it's hard to feel any stronger toward them. You admire the artistic design, the set of colors, the little jokes here and there, but the only real lesson is that there is strength in unity, but this is a message you can respond to in a war or a sport movie and even then you have the main protagonist.Animation is a world of magic and dream, to be enjoyed in a more individual way, where you can hook your heart on one person. \"A Bug's Life\" should have been called \"Bugs' Lives\", it's great animation but not necessarily a great film."], ["It Bugs Me that this Movie isn't More Loved", "A Bug's Life was Pixar's second dip into the movie business and is widely considered to be on the lower end of Pixar's quality films. When I was growing up or was one of my favorites, and to this day I don't get where the hate comes from. This movie follows an inventor ant named Flik (Dave Foley) who is your stereotype clumsy dreamer. His colony is extorted through fear of the grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), for their food. The grasshoppers make the ants collect food for them to have during the \"Rainy Season.\" After Flik accidentally destroys a large supply of food, causing Hopper to double the quota, Flik goes on a quest to find some big bugs in the big city to protect the colony and stop the tyrannical grasshopper rule once and for all. Unfortunately, he gets a group of bad circus performers instead, and may find a way to use their limited talents to save them all. This movie is underrated. The political undertones to this film speak volumes, especially in our current political climate. The voice acting is decent. Kevin Spacey definitely gives a menacing performance, and it's adorable to hear a young Hayden Panettiere as an ant princess. The animation is pretty nice for its time. Certain moments looked better than others, but the real triumph was texturing, especially in the grasshoppers' designs. This movie isn't perfect. Many moments were predictable, and the movie relied heavily on gags. But still, it's fun and funny. And it does craft moments of actual fear and shows kids the power people can have when they stand together. It's definitely aimed more towards kids (even if it does get a bit...*murdery* seriously, rewatch it, it's very dark), but adults can appreciate that there's something there for them too. Altogether I'd rate this movie a 7. Not a bad Pixar film. Should be seen.PS: Ratzenberger's role in this film was P.T.Flea, the ringleader of the circus bugs.

What a shame that Joe Ranft, the voice of Heimlich died. Such a lovable character. Then Pixar makes sure there's a good story to go with it. This story is about a colony of ants who are tormented by some bully grasshoppers who take what the ants work so hard for.

Their second feature film, A Bug's Life, may miss the bull's-eye but Pixar's target is so lofty, it's hard to find the film anything less than irresistible. Brighter and more colorful than the other animated insect movie of 1998 (Antz), A Bug's Life is the sweetly told story of Flik (voiced by David Foley), an ant searching for better ways to be a bug. His colony unfortunately revolves around feeding and fearing the local grasshoppers (lead by Hopper, voiced with gleeful menace by Kevin Spacey). When Flik accidentally destroys the seasonal food supply for the grasshoppers he decides to look for help (\"We need bigger bugs!\"). The ants, led by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), are eager to dispose of the troublesome Flik. Yet he finds help--a hearty bunch of bug warriors--and brings them back to the colony. Unfortunately they are just traveling performers afraid of conflict.As with Toy Story, the ensemble of creatures and voices is remarkable and often inspired. Highlights include wiseacre comedian Denis Leary as an UN-ladylike ladybug, Joe Ranft as the German-accented caterpillar, David Hyde Pierce as a stick bug, and Michael McShane as a pair of unintelligible pill bugs. The scene-stealer is Atta's squeaky-voiced sister, baby Dot (Hayden Panettiere), who has a big sweet spot for Flik.More gentle and kid-friendly than Antz, A Bug Life's still has some good suspense and a wonderful demise of the villain. However, the film--a giant worldwide hit--will be remembered for its most creative touch: \"outtakes\" over the end credits \u00e0 la many live-action comedy films.

My Rating: */****"], ["A great beginning to Pixar's lineup, and a great start to the careers of Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere.", "A Bug's Life is an underrated Pixar classic that easily gets forgotten among the likes of Toy Story, Monsters Incorporated, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, all of which had sequels or prequels in the 2010s. It is still very good as far as standalone films with no sequel go, like Megamind or Turbo. I always admired A Bug's Life because it had a great universal message - if you stop doubting yourself, you can discover your true potential and do what no one else thought was possible for you. It works on so many levels because it is a lesson most characters of A Bug's Life have to learn - Flik, Dot, Atta, the circus troupe, and even Molt. All the casting choices are great. I liked having Dave Foley as Flik, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Atta, and Richard Kind as Molt, and I am glad they did not have more expensive or famous names whom voice acting was not for, like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Aniston and Jack Black. The best part is, Dave Foley auditioned for Slim, one of the supporting roles, and he still made it as the lead role, Flik! A Bug's Life was the time of my life because it came out the year I was born, and it was also a big time for Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere since it was their first film role. A Bug's Life had a lot of talented TV comedy stars in it, with the only big movie names being Kevin Spacey (Hopper) and Denis Leary (Francis).Animated films are hardly any child's star-making role because you can not see them on screen, but Hayden Panettiere did such a great voice performance as Dot, it is a safe bet that this Pixar film was a good stepping stone to whatever her star-making role after A Bug's Life was. Ashley Tisdale also auditioned for Dot, but since she was 4 years older, she got another part as Lead Blueberry Scout, which was a much littler part than Dot, but still a good role to have. I am happy for Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere to have a decent acting career after A Bug's Life because they never got too famous for animation like Jodie Foster did, and they had a lot of variety in their acting because of this. If you were a kid from Ashley Tisdale, Hayden Panettiere & Jansen Panettiere's generation, chances are you remember A Bug's Life.Dot was always my first most favorite A Bug's Life character because she always respected and believed in Flik when no one else did, and Dot was also an interesting child protagonist with an arc of her own. I believe Dot should qualify as a primary character of A Bug's Life as much as Atta or Flik are, especially since she got to narrate the Disney Storyteller audiobook adaptation, and she made an excellent narrator there. All of the circus bugs have interesting or endearing personalities, and my third most favorite character is Slim. David Hyde Pierce really stole the show with his deadpan delivery. However, my second most favorite character is another scene-stealer that I really want to talk about: Molt! To emphasize the Kind in Richard Kind, Molt is the only kind grasshopper of A Bug's Life, and I love how he was written as a character. He was made to be a comic relief for the uncomfortable scenes with Hopper, and he is Hopper's brother because we know Hopper would never keep around someone so witless and annoying otherwise. Molt worked as a character for me because while he is not the sharpest tool in the shed, he never annoyed us the audience (only Hopper and other evil grasshoppers), he was not too stupid to live, he does not usually ruin things for the other bad guys, and I genuinely felt scared for Molt whenever Hopper approached him menacingly because I know Molt was always on the wrong side of this ant v. grasshopper conflict.If you like hearing Ashley Tisdale or Hayden Panettiere as children on their rise to stardom in the late 1990s, if you like inspirational messages about discovering your potential, if you like movies about bugs, or if you like revisiting early computer animation, A Bug's Life is the film for you! I highly recommend A Bug's Life over An All Dogs Christmas Carol, The Object of My Affection, Monsters University (just kidding), Antz, or Madame Blueberry. I never hated Antz, but compared to A Bug's Life, I found Antz to be darker at worst and forgettable at best. Though I am also impressed that A Bug's Life got a G rating in the late 1990s, since there was a drawing of Heimlich getting gored and two scenes of bugs getting \"drunk\" on blood or grain, as well as a few other alcoholic references."], ["Disney by numbers", "This was a massive disappointment. I saw \"Toy Story\" long after it came out, when the whole computer animation hype was long since old hat, but still loved it at once. I really enjoyed \"The Incredibles\" and thought \"Ratatouille\", \"WALL-E\", \"Up\" and \"Inside Out\" took animated film to a whole new level. But it turns out \"A Bug's Life\" is... a whole heap of steaming clichs.Almost from the very beginning it felt as if they were sticking in just about every Hollywood/Disney trope aimed at the under-tens, many of them painfully inappropriate to the setting. Sorry, but ants don't have cute little child ants who set up a 'clubhouse' and save the world when the adults are busy giving up; ants have squishy larvae. Grasshoppers don't have mothers or little brothers. Worker ants don't have romantic moments with 'princesses', because worker ants are FEMALE. (And seriously, if you were going to design an ant-powered flying machine, why would you power it with child ants, instead of the strongest team in the colony? On the other hand, if it was originally designed for adult ants, how would the little ones even be able to get the wings to move?)And then of course we've got the whole 'misunderstood loner whose brilliant ideas always go embarrassingly wrong' scenario, which I also found so clichd and obvious as to be almost painful. And 'the power of family/friendship can overcome everything' and 'you just need to believe in yourself'... it's practically a checkbox list of standard tropes, and while the same messages appear in many, many good films (there's a reason why they're standard), here I rapidly ended up with the feeling that it was Disney product being done by numbers. Watching \"A Bug's Life\" versus \"Toy Story\" is like watching \"Flushed Away\" versus \"Chicken Run\"; the magic isn't there and it's gone corporate.It was also very noticeable that for all the gnashing mouthparts and serrated limbs, the worst anyone gets threatened with in the script is getting 'stomped' or 'squished', which doesn't really match up to the visuals and again is rather obviously by-the-book for small children. The hero's Grand Plan is discarded (for no very clear reason -- why would the discovery of his deception about the circus prevent the planned 'scare-crow' tactic from working?) and then heroically launched again at the last minute and then after a prolonged show fails anyway. In another context that might have come across as stunning originality, but by that point it just struck me as being an excuse for this film to have its cake and eat it; for him to be a Great Inventor, but also demonstrate that true strength comes from love and the power of unity and standing up to your fears, blah blah blah.As a result the finale is incredibly prolonged -- like much of the rest of the film. The 'botched circus' scene at the beginning in particular felt as if it lasted far too long, partly I think because it was presumably supposed to be funny, and that's not my type of humour at all. (But then, thinking about it, that goes for quite a lot of the would-be-funny parts of this film.)I'm afraid I found \"A Bug's Life\" actively annoying from quite early on, and I'm not quite sure in all justice why. It felt cynically manipulative and shallow, as if you could see all the cogs turning and buttons being pushed, and being stuffed with bad biology didn't help. (Heinrich the fat caterpillar pupates and turns into... a fat caterpillar with wings?) I felt zero chemistry where the characters were concerned. Yes, it's a U-rated children's film that was never aimed at the likes of me in the first place, but a good children's film ought to work for adults too.After all, I've seen plenty of pictures that commit the 'sins' mentioned above, and loved them. \"Chicken Run\", for instance, features hens with teeth acting in a highly anthropomorphic way, and it even has an artificial flapping bird... but that production struck me as simply brilliant. And compared to a lot of children's films, \"A Bug's Life\" does more or less show its villain being killed and eaten, whereas a lot of classic Hollywood movies go to lengths to indicate that if the villain dies, that's absolutely not the hero's responsibility in any way.I think perhaps what irked me about it was that there didn't seem to be any greater depth -- any references that adults could be expected to get over and above the target audience. The humour remains on the level of \"Francis is a male 'lady'bird... haw, haw haw\", the romance is school-gate stuff, and the attempts at emotional manipulation aren't exactly sophisticated. It was like being subjected to a lecturer who persists in talking to a mixed audience as if they were all six-year-olds."], ["good movie for all ages", "Fun and entertaining movie. pretty funny. felt a little off at times but enjoyable overall (about 3 viewings, 6/13/2020)0 out of 0 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A bug's life", "After dazzling everyone with its unforgettable debut that revolutionised the entire animation industry in the long run, Pixar Animation Studios' follow up to their highly revered Toy Story is another wonderful piece of imagination, innovation & animation that once again presents a unique take on life but this time from a bug's point of view.The story of A Bug's Life follows a misfit ant who thinks differently yet only ends up causing more trouble for his colony so when his latest escapade wastes away all the food ants had gathered to offer to the greedy grasshoppers, he decides to make up for it by finding & recruiting tough warrior bugs to save the entire colony from its oppressors.Directed by John Lasseter, A Bug's Life marks Pixar's second consecutive home-run & just like their previous feature, brims with so much creativity & passion that the narrative it puts on the silver screen remains finely balanced in storytelling department and is then taken to the next level by further refinement & advancement in their state-of-the-art animation.There are wide range of bugs to be found in this fable and the animators have done a fab job in envisioning, designing & rendering all of them. While none of its characters manage to be memorable, it's the sum of the parts that makes it click. The themes it deals with are nicely addressed, humour is effectively used, score is lightweight but fitting & it never loses its sense of fun.On an overall scale, A Bug's Life is definitely one of Pixar's most underrated films that may not have anything as memorable as the studio's best works but it nonetheless scores high marks in all filmmaking aspects to make up for an enjoyable & entertaining ride that viewers of all ages can benefit from plus delivers its message of 'strength in unity' with remarkable simplicity & effectiveness.In many ways, I find it to be a reflection of Pixar's very own modus operandi for it offers an interesting insight into the way these talented minds come together under one roof for the sole purpose of envisioning, creating & stringently refining stories that are fun & entertaining but also not devoid of heart, soul & emotions, with an added incentive to be able to do that without compromising with the art or quality of its medium."], ["F-Ant-astic", "The protagonist of this film is relatable from the first moment we meet him. Flik is the idealistic underdog that just begs to be identified with. Flik is the black sheep of the ant colony, and when his invention ruins the tribute to the predatory Grasshoppers, he needs to right this wrong. He recruits a troop of circus bigs, thinking them to be mighty warriors, and the whole group rallies the ant colony to defeat the Grasshopper invasion. The characters are vivid, outlandish, and provide a logical (if strange) set of skills that come in handy. I tend to dislike movies or shows where a huge plot point is based around a miscommunication that could be avoided/solved with basic logic, but in this context, it makes some sense. I can understand the pressure and anxiety that would accompany correcting someone who has overestimated your worth. The emotional beats in this movie land with grace. When the colony discovers that the troupe is real performers, rather than warriors, the betrayal is palpable, and the loss seems personal. When, in the end, the caterpillar finally gains his butterfly wings, it is a small delightful moment of wish fulfillment. John Lasseter directed some of the most iconic films of my childhood and had the same magic touch in each. Toy Story, Cars, The Incredibles, and this movie all have the same magical sense of whimsy and crazy events that remain anchored in real, relatable people."], ["Kinda meh for Pixar", "Pretty much every aspect of this movie is just okay. How's the plot? It's OK. How are the characters? They're OK. How's the voice acting? It's good but nothing remarkable. No one ever gets any strong emotions across, but it's far from bad. How's the romance? It's not cringey but the development is non existent.The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing and the fact that it's boring. I only audibly laughed once or twice, and that was only me exhaling through my nose. Also the animation still holds up, but it's so boring to look at. Like it's not distracting in a bad way, but it's not eye catching in a good way either. Again the movie doesn't really have anything bad in it so it does remains watchable.The one stand out is the villain Hopper. He's voice acted extremely well by Kevin Spacey, and he is legitimately threatening and entertaining. He significantly elevated any scene he was in.And the reason this movie this movie is a 7 and not a 6 is because the 3rd act is much less boring than the first 2 acts. It increases the suspense and is actually interesting. Not amazing but an improvement. The movie goes out on a high-ish note.Also the circus bugs were better than any of the ant characters.

This mishap lands Flick in some serious hot water with the ant council and Flick voluntarily banishes himself from ant island, to which the council agrees.The action heads to the \"city\" (a dirty little place under someones trailer), there Flick seeks out warrior bugs, and finds them in the form of Slim, Francis and the gang.The gang, including Flick head back to ant island, where the majority of the film will now take place, ups and downs and lovely subtle comedy ensue, resulting in the island hatching a plan to take down Hopper and the evil grasshoppers.Call me a baddie, but my favourite character was actually the films baddie, antagonist Hopper, he was so cool, but in a toned down kind of way, nothing genuinely nasty, like all lifeforms he's simply doing what he needs to to survive.The music was typical of any Disney or Pixar film, perfect in other words, it evoked excitement and calm at the same time, never once getting out of hand or too much, perfect for kids.Nature, the very essence of the plot, nothing in the story was false, every element was true to how would be in nature, only in an exaggerated way, oh so simple, to produce magic from a story so simple shows true genius, and they don't get much better than Pixar.As for the ending, a little weepy for the faint hearted, as the bugs and the circus they are employed by disappear off into the sunset, their work complete, Flick, the newly appointed Queen Atta, and the newly appointed Princess Dot watch on as streams of wheat act as fireworks being propelled into the sky and the whole ant colony waves goodbye.

To help his colony rid their land of the hopping menace, Flik tries to seeks out warrior bugs that would help out but, instead, he unknowingly returns to the colony with a circus crew.This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic as it cleverly shows a bug's world from their point of view. The story is full of adventure, from Flik running into the flea circus to the ants trying to defend themselves from the grasshoppers. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate the bug humor and, of course, it's typical for a Disney animated movie that the filmmakers would make the ladybug character a guy in the story.There are some slow plot points in the first half of the movie, especially during Flik's solo scenes, but the plot picks up steam during the second half, especially when the circus and ants conjure up the plan to defeat the grasshoppers. It is also notable that the film concentrates on redemption, endurance and never-say-die attitude of the ant colony, proving that even the \"little guys\" are ferocious and determined.Just like the Toy Story movies, this animated film will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination.Grade B"], ["Pixar Does Ants", "A misfit ant (Dave Foley), looking for \"warriors\" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, recruits a group of bugs that turn out to be an inept circus troupe.At the time this came out, it was probably a big hit.

I've re-visited this film a few more times since my first viewing and whilst watching it on Amazon Prime Instant Video this morning, I laughed at it more than I have done for ages. I know how easy it is for people to compare this to 'Antz' but I find this more memorable than 'Antz' if not quite as entertaining as the 'Toy Story' franchise.The animation is just as good as that in the first 'Toy Story' film with the ants looking more colourful if more cartoonish than those in 'Antz,' the grasshoppers looking more realistic, luscious natural backgrounds and a creative use of junk to make it look like a city. The water droplets were also well-made. It wasn't until today's viewing that I noticed this film was loosely based on Aesop's fable 'The Ant and the Grasshopper' and the story is pretty straightforward in terms of Flik searching for more bugs to help the colony gather more food for the grasshoppers after he accidentally knocks the first batch into the stream.

The voice acting is very good.

The colony has to each year gather food for the grasshoppers, mainly Hopper and his gang. Flik seems to mess up everything unknowingly, in a way that is endearing. And somehow his \"inventions\" don't seem to work and the more he tries the more he fails. When Flik upsets the pile of food that the ants have been collecting for Hopper all summer, he realises that he's really done it this time. Hopper arrives, scares them to high heavens, and messes with their minds - he gives them \"one last chance\". The ants, terrified, start collecting food again, this time double the load. As well as double food for Hopper, they need to start collecting for themselves. But it's late summer and there isn't much left to pick, feeling guilty, and coming up with a huge plan, Flik offers to travel to city, round up some tough warrior bugs, return, and fight off Hopper and his crew. The Ant Queen, Princess Atta (for whom Flik has a massive crush) and the other ants all agree to this - but only because they want Flik out of their way! Flik is determined to make a difference and give something back to his colony, but can he do it? Can he redeem himself and save his colony from Hopper? And if he does, how?I thought A Bug's Life addressed bullying, and is the only animated film from Pixar to have done so. Even many Disney films have not addressed bullying so openly and easily. A Bug's Life, though subtle, addresses an issue.The animation is STUNNING. I am a great fan of animated movies, especially by Pixar, and I think this is one of their best. Finding Nemo, Toy Story, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc. to name a few, A Bug's Life still remains as a classic Pixar animation, despite being one of their oldest movies. I thought the animation of the ants was done well, but better than that, was the landscape, and background. Each leaf was perfect, each stem defined and textured.What I like most about A Bug's Life is that it makes you feel as if you know the ants, as they live a similar life to you. They talk, they eat, they shop, they buy drinks and have pubs, this made the movie so enjoyable and I finished watching it with a new-found respect for the bug world!"], ["It has terrific animation, colorful characters and pure storyline, what more could you ask for in a film?", "My take: What animated movies are all about.Seeing a different kind of world when venturing in the movies have always been a delight to me.

Ask for A BUG'S LIFE, which tells the story of a colony of ants, bullied by a swarm of grasshoppers, who has nothing to do but lay around, is a less complicated plot. Thus, A BUG'S LIFE is the movie to show the kids more often, while ANTZ will be the adults'.I'm not just rating A BUG'S LIFE high because it's a terrific animated film.

The animation in the film is just brilliant. This movie is a movie to talk about how great 3D animation is. The story is set on the ground in a somewhat vacant part or something, and from their level you can see all the details to the single rocks on the ground. And if I'm going to talk about this movie I would like to bring up the character Hopper. I just watched this movie recently and it just dawned on me this character is a very underrated villain. He is smart, powerful and scary. He is also very serious but what got to me was how clever he was.

It may be the studio's least immediate film, but it grows with time thanks to what amounts to a kind of minimalism. It's less flashy and bombastic that any other cartoon feature I can remember; its dramatic peak arrives with the placement of a rock on the ground.The SEVEN SAMURAI-inspired story couldn't be farther from the Andrew Lloyd Webberish monotony of the trite Disney features that have arrived in the last few years. A BUG'S LIFE dares to be intricate and unsentimental (a welcome characteristic in most of the Pixar features), and it becomes a sweeping epic with some light but cutting humor and a sense of journey that should make repeat viewings a treat even for the parents forced to sit through it over and over.What's more, the voice acting is terrific, with an excellent performance by David Foley and a no-holds-barred, terrifying turn from Kevin Spacey, who is far closer to his SE7EN character than to K-PAX world in this G-rated film. I haven't even mentioned the animation, which in a world of fast-moving technical advancement at this studio and everywhere still looks astounding seven years later.All the Pixar movies are surprising, but A BUG'S LIFE has a creative spark that completely blindsides the viewer. The plotty bits can drag slightly, especially those involving the circus crew, usually far less interesting than the lead character and villain, but no matter. These vivid characters and an absorbing story make for almost peerless entertainment."], ["It's a buggy bug world out there...", "A BUG'S LIFE / Starring David Foley, Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey / Directed by John Lasseter / Written by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft / Rated G / *** 1/2A Bug's Life, for me, never reaches the height of humor, wit and emotion as the Pixar perfects like Toy Story 1-2, Monsters, Inc. or even their latest masterpiece Finding Nemo. I'd say it's the weakest of the Pixar films. However, with it still being a Pixar production, it is probably one of the better children's flicks made in 1998. It's still better than the somewhat forgettable Antz and is even maybe a bit more 'adult' than the others (besides the Toy Story movies). Inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, A Bug's Life is one heck of a wild ride into the world of computer animation.Flik (David Foley) is a lone ant living with his colony on Ant Island who's not really friends with anyone. He seems to always mess things up. You see, in the buggy bug world of this movie, ants collect food over the seasons to feed to the greedy and bullying grasshoppers, lead by the menacing Hopper (Kevin Spacey). When Flik messes up, Hopper commands the ants to give him and his gang twice as much food as before or they'll be tearing up Ant Island. Commanded by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Flik journeys across the world of insects and finally comes along with a gang of circus bugs. However, will these circus bugs be any help the army of grasshoppers?The film is probably more visually-impressive than Pixar's previous Toy Story was never reaches the brilliant animation of Finding Nemo. The facial animation particularly is amazing compared to first Toy movie. It didn't seem so much like computer animation than a fully-realized world. Even the backdrops and set animation was a joy to look at. Bug's Life has a little more freedom than Toy Story in terms of animation simply because of it's setting. This movie unravels a world, much like the other Pixar films, where anything is possible. It just has a lot more to do, being in the open earth instead of being stuck in a kid's bedroom.The film's main problem is that it just isn't as imaginative as Toy Story, Monsters, Inc. or even the splashy fish tale Finding Nemo. There is a joyful little scene where Flik searches a bug city of gigantic proportions (for us, minature proportions) for warrior bugs to lend a hand against the grasshoppers. This scene is probably the best that appears. Bugs of every shape and size (even a towering spider) move and act like in a normal city, buildings being replaced by cracker boxes and empty pop bottles. Even a tin can acts as a bug bar. This, however, is the only scene bursting with imagination, on the other hand Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story 2 have millions of sequences full of wit. Much of the movie features ants and the group of circus bugs. Finding Nemo has countless new things to look at in every scene.However, it still is Pixar, it still is a marvel of pacing and is still a marvel of beauty. When Pixar creates a movie, the movie is sure to be an instant classic, and A Bug's Life is no exception. Much like Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, Pixar cranks out masterpieces like first-class restaurants dish out food. It comes so quick and the meal is so nourishing and delicious that you're just craving more. Hopefully this studio has another twenty or thirty films in need of releasing. Sooner or later Pixar will notice that Disney are only the training wheels and when they're ready, they'll be hammering them to the ground. Nowadays, Disney's films are a bit more forgetable yet Pixar's are bursting with classical magic, much like Disney in their golden years. Let's just hope they stay forever."], ["Foley tried his best(SPOILERS)", "I first saw Dave Foley when he was doing \"Kids In The Hall\". I thought he was a comic genius.

No longer are the qualities of the faces affected by symmetrical shapes.  In \"Tin Toy\", Tinny was cute, but his face was a perfect sphere.  The baby was supposed to be cute, but because his face could not be perfectly round and still seem realistic, his face was ruined by unintended harsh angles that were supposed to give the baby a more \"human\" look.  In \"A Bug's Life\", we now have cute ants whose faces are not perfectly spherical, yet are not ruined.  The lines and bends in their faces and bodies are smooth and flexible.  The sharp features that made the baby so sinister looking are reserved for the evil grasshoppers. The scene where Hopper is about to crush Flick's head is frightening not only because of what is happening, but because of the intense looks of anger/pleasure on Hopper's face, and the extreme fear on Flick's face.It's not only the characters that make \"A Bugs Life\" a triumph.  We see how far we've come since \"Luxo Jr.\" when it was too risky to move the camera.  Now the camera swoops and swirl through the air.  The high-speed chase in the rain is particularly stunning.  The rain adds added atmosphere, as well as a way to indicate just how fast they are flying.  As the camera bobs up and down as it rushes through space, we can hardly believe that this is not real.  I think it works better than a live action chase, because there is not that awkward mix between special effects and reality.  Because \"A Bugs Life\" is all special effects, it is it's own reality"], ["Much better than Antz!!!", "Ahh... The Disney/Pixar magic is back. I waited three years for A Bug's Life, and it did not disappoint. Unlike it's direct competition, Antz, A Bug's Life is a light hearted, fun filled adventure directed at kids, but good enough for adults. Flik (voice of Dave Foley) is an ant. And like all ants in his colony, he picks grains and fruits all year long. And once a year, the bad grasshoppers, lead by Hopper (voice of Kevin Spacey) come to the colony and take all the grain. The ants just accept this as their way of life. But one day Flik decides to do something different. He figures if the ants can recruit bigger and badder insects, they can scare the grasshoppers away, and keep all the food for themselves. So he heads to the \"big city\" to find some really tough bugs. Unfortunately for him, he finds some circus bugs who he thinks are tough. But he brings them back to the colony, and through the magic of luck, they manage to scare the grasshoppers away.Obviously everyone and their mother is going to compare A Bug's Life to that other bug movie that came out a couple months before. The biggest difference is that the other movie was aimed more at the adult crowd, while this movie is aimed towards kids. The characters are cuter, funnier, and more fun. With characters like Flik, and Dot, and Tuck & Roll (my favorites), A Bug's Life makes it fun to go to the movies. I didn't have any fun when I saw Antz. With Woody Allen's neurotic attitude, and all those dead bugs, I felt like I was watching an animated war film. With A Bug's Life, I felt like I was watching a light-hearted comedy with spectacular animation. I honestly felt that at times I was really watching bugs in my backyard. It felt so real it was amazing. And another thing I've come to realize, even in animation, it's important to have a story that people want to see. Now I realize Antz made a lot of money, but I'm not sure why. With A Bug's Life I felt like a kid again. I cheered for the good bugs, and booed the bad bugs. The circus bugs were cutely drawn, and the voices matched the bugs perfectly. Woody Allen as an ant just didn't fly for me. But David Hyde-Pierce as a stick bug was perfect. Basically what I'm saying is, if you want to see what real animation is about, a good story, fun characters, good voices, and most of all a good time, rent A Bug's Life. Besides, you get two pluses. One, they showed Pixar's 1997 Academy Award winning animation short, Geri's Game before the movie, and they had these hilarious \"outtakes\" during the closing credits.

A Bug's Life is a great film to take the children to, or perhaps to even attend by yourself, without having to leave half way through to take the tyke to the toilet or to get the little bugger more popcorn.A Bug's Life was made by the same mob who brought us the amazing Toy Story; amazing from a technical point of view anyway. I'm no expert on animation but it appears that matt, painted backgrounds were often used in A Bug's Life, whereas all of the backgrounds were digitally produced in Toy Story, which must have been hellishly expensive.Antz also has a glossier, more exquisite look to it than A Bug's Life, but we all know that some of the funniest stuff on film has been pretty roughly produced. Remember those great old Chaplin or Keaton films. Technology can't compensate for poor actors or a lousy script. And slapstick will win out more often than more sophisticated humour.Our hero ant in A Bug's Life is a crazy inventor who heads off to bug city to get some help to fight off some stand over grasshoppers.

I was surprised to find that I enjoyed Antz more. Animation aside, the stories are amazingly similar: underdog ant triupmphs and saves the day! While the  story line of Antz was engaging, A Bug's Life seemed just a little too predictable. Both stories are thinly veiled morality tales but A Bug's Life is practically transparent. The characters aren't as well developed and the plot is rather weak.Unlike Toy Story which was driven by the excellent plot, and featured the most amazing computer animation ever to hit the big screen, A Bug's Life seemed to be driven by the animation. And as everybody knows whose seen a sci-fi flick that has an over-reliance on special effects, the effects just can't carry the movie. The same can be said of animation. While the animation in A Bug's Life is excellent-despite the over-use of pastel colors to depict the ants-the story lags behind. Not only that, it doesn't have the same cross-over appeal as Toy Story.

Firstly, there are no stupid songs in it, which are just slow the story down (don't forget this is a Disney production, until \"Atlantis\" it was compulsory to put songs in Disney animations).

Yes and no.Yes, because the child-friendly changes to the plot are interesting and rather Aesopian, since it is also an extended version of the ant and the grasshopper fable.  There are great references to the Magnificent Seven, and the pageant the little ants (especially the picture of one of them dying \"because our teacher said it would be more dramatic\") is hilarious.No, because the seven-plus-two warrior bugs that Flick gets are stock characters, and only the ladybug has any resemblance to any previous incarnation (he is basically the Mifune character--he is ridiculed by others not for being a peasant instead of a samurai but because he is a male ladybug, and also he is the one who befriends the children).  There is not a stoic character like Yul Brenner or Takashi Shimura to lead the pack, which I find a bit of an oversight (the praying mantis is hardly stoic in my opinion).The animation is truly astounding, with beautiful scenery and \"camera\" shots.  This is Pixar's most Miyazaki-esque film, which is why I like it so much (look for homages to Laputa and Kiki).  In spite of this, I have to rank A Bug's Life below the Toy Story movies because of the ludicrous slapstick beginning that sets the plot in motion--the same sort of annoying joke that Disney deemed necessary to push the plot forward in Mulan (Mushu shooting off a rocket for no apparent reason) and Tarzan (the elephant stampede) when they were stuck for a logical reason.  Would it have been too much to ask for Flick to actually have been a hero?  What if, as bandits often do, they go down the anthole anyway just to harass them and make them work harder for them--then just have the movie go just as it is--the grasshoppers pick on Princess Dot, Flick tells them to leave her alone, and then Hopper orders double the order for next time and everybody starts worrying about that.  Flick could be banished for that reason--sort of like what happens in Princess Mononoke when Ashitaka saves the girls but gets cursed and so has to leave and never return.One other complaint--Dot believing she can and should be able to fly before her body is ready is an outright dangerous concept for Pixar to condone, despite society's current mentality towards girl-power and the \"youth are always right\" generation.

At the beginning of the movie Flik (main character) caused the grain to fall in a creek and the ants did not have enough food for the grasshoppers. Their leader Hopper gave the ants until \"the last leaf fell\" to get \"double the order of food\". I enjoy to watch Fliks adventure to find \"warrior\" bugs to fight the grasshoppers and save the ants. Unfortunately Flik came back to \"Ant Island\" and with circus bugs. They were a combination of insects like a Lady Bug (Francis) a Black Widow Spider (Rosie), and others. Flik found out about this misunderstanding and the circus bugs were about to leave but when they saved Dot (Queen Ants little daughter) they decided to stay. About half way through the movie Flik and Princess Atta fall in love (that was cool). Flik comes up with another plan to build a bird (Hopper is afraid of birds) and scare Hopper and the rest of the grasshoppers away. Soon after the bird was complete all the other ants find out the truth about the \"circus bugs\" (because of P.T. Fleas big mouth) and Princess Atta orders Flik to leave and never return. Flik was sad but he and the circus bugs came back to the Ant Island when Dot told flik that Hopper was going to kill the Queen Ant (the grasshoppers came back to Ant Island and the ants did not have enough food). When Flik came back and put the built bird plan to action it scared off all of the grasshoppers except Hopper who found out that the bird was fake. He went after Flik in a rage. When Princess Atta took Flik away from Hopper they ended up right by a birds nest. That was the final showdown between Flik and Hopper. Lets just say that Hopper got fed to three baby birds. In the end the circus bugs returned to the circus, Flik and Princess Atta are together, and everybody live happily ever after.

Of course, it is expected that he will never return. What he finds instead is a group of circus bugs.

Not only has Pixar outdone themselves by creating a more visually exciting film than Toy Story, but they have also added a bunch of hilarious outtakes during the credits.The film's plot is a simple one. A colony of ants are forced to provide food for a group of viscious grasshoppers year after year, until one brave ant decides to do something about it, by leaving the island in search of stronger bugs to help them fight off the grasshoppers. But, instead he finds a small group of failed circus bugs.Fast paced wholly computer animated film is almost too much of a good thing, with a brilliant screenplay, excellent character development, superior cinematography, and a great musical score by Randy Newman, who also did Toy Story.

Who are these wild, slave bugs/animals we see in every disney feature since 1930?

I love Dave Foley in Newsradio and the casting of him as an ant was pretty straight on.  Still there weren't any interesting facets to his character.  The smallest princess ant was very annoying.

That may be true but the characters still looked like lifeless puppets.  That could have been forgiven if the plot was worthwhile.  It lagged all the way.  The whole idea of a circus of bugs wasn't that interesting.  It was just an excuse to bring in some of the more exotic type insects.I do admit that the movie looked good, but it was all overly pastel and Disney styled.

No weak parts, a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets, an astonishing 3D bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality)... and that's only to mention the technical aspects.The scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness ! Curiously, and obviously thanks to Lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in A bug's life.

Simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.Since Microcosmos, many movies tell tales of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I do think that A bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all.

I have to say that \"Antz\" is the better movie: cleverer and not so silly. \"A Bug's Life\" has the occasional funny reference to the real world, but it's no match for \"Antz\".As for the cast. I don't know who Dave Foley is. It's a bit jarring to hear Kevin Spacey's voice, now that he's fallen from grace. The rest of the cast includes Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis Diller, Denis Leary, Madeline Kahn, Roddy McDowall and Edie McClurg. Put another way, it stars Elaine, a comedienne, the ref, Lili von Schtupp, Cornelius and Ferris Bueller's principal's secretary (McClurg also appeared as the clerk who receives a profanity-laden rant from Steve Martin's character in \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\")."], ["Always root for the under-ant", "Ahhh yes, another childhood animated classic film.

Not to say that it's bad but honestly it's really really hard for me to decide whether I like this movie or not. Let's talk about the good stuff first, the animation, colors, settings, and character designs are all beautiful, it definitely matches up with the cheerful tone that the film is supposed to match up with. A lot of the voices are really good ranging from Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Denis Leary, Richard Kind, Jonathan Harris, David Hyde Pierce, Brad Garret, Madeline Kahn, and even some of the main Pixar guys voiced a few characters. The most memorable part of the film is the circus bugs, they are the film's biggest highlight, Denis Leary is Francis the Ladybug who's constantly mistaken for a woman, David Hyde Pierce is Slim the Stick-Bug who's always used as a prop, Brad Garret is Dim the Beetle who looks dangerous and tough but is actually a gigantic baby that's supervised by Rosy the Black Widow who's voiced by Bonnie Hunt, a pair of acrobats named Tuck and Roll who don't speak English and are my favorite characters, Jonathan Harris is Manny the Prey-Mantis who is a blind fortune-teller and is married to a gorgeous butterfly named Gypsy who's voiced by Madeline Kahn, every scene they're in is constantly hilarious, there's never a single moment involving where I would say \"that's not funny....\" or \"what was the point of that?\" Finally as mentioned in the headline for this review, the best part of the film is the fourth and final act, starting from when the last leaf falls, the grasshoppers have moved into the ant-hill and are forcing the ants to get every last drop of food on the island making them their slaves, Dot being the only ant who believes in Flik tries to convince him and the circus bugs to come back to make things right but Flik doesn't want to because the amount backlash he received from the colony after the truth about the circus bugs was revealed finally convinced him that what the colony thought of him was true, that he was a guaranteed failure who tries to make things better for people but instead always made things worse, Dot convinces Flik that it doesn't matter what people think of you, you can always achieve your goals if you just believe in yourself, thus Flik agrees to make things right by using the bird that he and the others built, at first it starts off really well but then it accidentally gets sabotaged, Hopper then forces Thumper to beat him half to death in front of everyone to teach them a lesson saying that ants were put on Earth to serve grasshoppers, but Flik convinces everyone otherwise by saying the best line in the movie, \"Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers. I've seen these ants do great things, and year after year they somehow manage to pick food for themselves and you. So who is the weaker species? Ants don't serve grasshoppers! It's you who need us! We're a lot stronger than you say we are... And you know it, don't you?\" Hopper fed up with Flik decides to kill him himself but right when he's about to Princess Atta and the other ants become convinced that they were wrong and stand up for themselves giving us that triumphant feeling that lots of epic climaxes give us, the battle between ants and grasshoppers begins with the all the grasshoppers getting scared away and Hopper about to get shot out of a cannon, but suddenly it starts to rain, which gives Hopper the advantage of grabbing Flik to finish him off, Atta comes to the rescue and Flik thinks up a plan, he gets cornered by Hopper and right when he's about to choke him to death, a bird appears and Hopper gets fed to its babies, the film then ends with the ants saying goodbye to the circus bugs, Atta becoming queen, and Flik is declared being a true hero. But unfortunately what causes the film to go downhill really causes it to go downhill, the adviser ants, Princess Atta, and the Queen are so unbelievably obnoxious, always talking down to Flik and Dot going on about how they'll never achieve anything and this isn't just occasional insults, it happens constantly throughout most of the film, they get on my nerves to the point where it's unwatchable, they even tried to get rid of Flik by saying they'll agree to let him look for warriors when really they're just trying to get rid of him, which is why my least favorite scene is when it's revealed that the circus bugs aren't warriors, therefore the colony has to call Flik a disgrace and kick him out because they apparently would rather be slaves than listen to someone who's just misunderstood, what were they thinking? So this film is nowhere near terrible, as mentioned before the fourth act starting from when the last leaf falls is spectacular, but I just feel that the ants having to be so mean-spirited and cruel towards Flik was just way too much for me."], ["A good film for all the insect lovers", "I don't remember my first reaction to the film, much less all the hype that came out while the movie was in theaters.

I haven't seen anything this detailed since Toy Story. It's also inspired by that fable featuring the grasshopper and the ant. I remember that story vaguely but could not find it again.

Kinda sorta.Okay, allow me to explain. A Bug's Life, the second ever Pixar film, tells about a distant and isolated ant colony who have been harassed by a swarm of grasshoppers for time immemorial. Every summer they arrive, every summer they eat their food, every summer they promise to come back. Until one day, through an unfortunate accident, there is no food for the grasshoppers to eat, and they threaten to flatten to colony unless they can gather enough food for them. Unfortunately, there's not enough time left to do so. So an unlucky ant, named Flik, volunteers to go look for help. He finds warrior bugs. Or at least he thinks he does.That's a kid-friendly version of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Or a kid-friendly version of The Magnificent Seven, if you're more familiar with the westernized version.Of course it's not quite as cut and dry as that, but you can definitely see the inspiration behind the whole thing. And it works. It's a classic story for a reason and this is a mighty fine retelling of that. The characters are likable, the action is enjoyable, the film looks colourful and there are good morals to be learned.Then again, the computer effects have not aged particularly well. The grasshoppers still look menacing and scary, but the ants look plasticky, the backgrounds belong in a low-budget video game and overall it has this feel of where the bar was lowest to it. It also suffers from the problem of having a character or two too many. Seven Samurai could get away with it. That movie is over three hours long. A Bug's Life is barely over an hour and a half.Still, I have fond memories of this film and it was still an enjoyable hour and a half even as an adult. Pixar has nothing to be ashamed of, especially given that this was only their second outing."], ["A step down from \"Toy Story\"", "Not a bad movie by any means, but it's hard not to be disappointed by the degree to which Pixar's second feature falls short of the very high standard it set with its first, \"Toy Story.\" Visually, \"A Bug's Life\" is almost as impressive and should be applauded for a completely different setting -- writers/directors Lasseter and Stanton certainly can't be accused of simply repeating themselves.Unfortunately, the characterizations here aren't nearly as rich and entertaining and the casting not as inspired. Phyllis Diller could almost make a good substitute for the function Don Rickles served in \"Toy Story,\" but she's not given enough to do and never really gets to cut loose. Kevin Spacey is always a good villain and adds some spice to the proceedings as Hopper, but the notion of making grasshoppers into a biker gang -- which should have worked well -- is half-heartedly executed. The rest of the cast, particularly Dave Foley and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, aren't especially interesting or memorable. After a slow start, the film definitely picks up with the introduction of the circus, performers of which provide most of the comic relief, but the only standout is Heimlich the caterpillar who can't wait to get his wings.Overall, the story is a bit too convoluted to convey the simple, powerful messages about conformity and perseverance the film wants to deliver as cleanly as it might with a tighter story structure. This is probably a film children will still enjoy, but unlike \"Toy Story,\" there isn't as much here for people who've passed through puberty."], ["Good Story, Messed Up...", "A Bug's life had a good story. HAD. The potential of the movie was of course rather good, but the final outcome of the movie, was actually messed up. The animations of the movie are like the animations of a person, who just finished his animation classes.The only reason why I have given a 6, is that I did like the story, the imagination of the way things would look like in an insects world and also the way of portraying how far,someone is willing to go, for they want, or think is write.Overall, a good film, worthy enough for an Oscar nomination.MY RATING = 6/101 out of 2 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Still a very good movie, but one of my least favorite to watch", "Pixar's 2nd feature, Bug's Life, finds them expanding their animation palette, expanding the boundaries of storytelling, and getting a little muddled in the process. This IS a very good movie, one that for the most part delights and enthralls, but something is lacking here. After reflecting on it a moment, I think the main element is forcing things in an unnatural way with not completely fleshed out characters. Pixar films have a way of taking great stories, telling them very effectively, and letting them unfold at a natural pace. And that's the problem (albeit a minor one) with Bug's Life. There are the multitude of jokes, but this time some work and some don't. Some of the characters, especially the circus crew, are not fleshed out well at all. Instead, they seem as superficial as cardboard caricatures who when they react to certain situation, leave us with no insights or surprises. And Flick himself is not the most engaging lead (maybe it was the high pitch of Foley's voice?). Couple that with jokes that aren't quite as funny and you get a movie where a lot of love was poured into the animation (which is fabulous) and good intent was poured into a potentially great story but where I felt something lacking. That being said, it still is Pixar, and it still dazzles! There is one scene at the locust hangout that might be a little too brutal for small kids, but it is for the most part age appropriate for all ages. A good, but not great Pixar film.

Yet it seems this highly underrated movie inexplicably will always stay in Toy Story's shadow.The story truly is inspired. I love how it serves as a warning about the McCarthey Era, which seems an an overlooked time in our nation's history as this movie is. Flick represents new ideas, inventions, and forward thinking as well as the working man. The ants represent our society and (again) the working man. When communists come to America to take our spoils, Flick (foward thinking) is sent to retrieve people to help them (our local government). When it turns out the government is of no help, Flick is placed in the role of the working man and becomes a vigilante, just as people were putting the matters (and firepower) into their own hands."], ["Nature has a certain order", "Abridged from 2,308 words to fit the IMDb limit of 1,000 words.Since drawings are inherently genderless, the animation of gender provides unique opportunities for distorting gender stereotypes.A Bug's Life opens with a portrayal of gender hierarchy. The ants are technically ruled by a queen, but in reality by her daughter, the princess. Hence we see from the outset the intrusion of human gender politics into a world created to amuse, and perhaps educate, human children. Note: real queen ants doesn't rule, they merely breed.In Disney's bug society the workers are subservient to female ants. That is nature. What is not natural is that in A Bug's Life the worker ants have male voices. Real worker ants are female: male ants only exist to inseminate the queen, and die shortly after mating.In this imaginary world all the ants of both sexes have enough to live healthy and natural lives. There are only two problems with this microcosm: and males cause both.Flik is a bumbling male inventor and engineer. Engineering seems to be a negative, destructive, patriarchal force. We see plant stalks damaged by one of his inventions, and the princess - a female - being crushed. This emphasises a stereotypical female victim/male destroyer role.The male worker ants gather food into a huge pile. They are directed by male ants. The gatherers are clearly of very limited intelligence: when a leaf falls in their path, they need help in order to get around it. The male helpers are slightly more intelligent, but not by much.The ants hide underground. The princess heroically ensures that her subjects are safe from what is evidently a dangerous situation. But bumbling Flik has been left outside. In an instant he contrives to lose the whole feast. The food pile was very precariously balanced to begin with - by male gatherers and male directors. The disaster is engineered entirely by males.Note that a real queen ant does not protect her colony, and has a smaller brain than her workers.The food was a conciliatory offering to a gang of grasshoppers: the matriarchal ant society had found a peaceful solution to a physical threat, but male action threatens that stability. The grasshoppers seem to be all male. They threaten, they swagger; yet they are bumbling and hypocritical. Stereotypical males, in other words.Cut to a fight between a beetle and a spider. The beetle is very threatening and appears to have all the physical advantages. Somehow, the spider hurts the beetle, which then bursts into tears. The spider consoles it. The beetle's voice is male, the spider's voice is female. Ergo, males can't really fight, despite their advantages; females are stronger and braver than males, regardless of size and strength. This message is repeated in the closing grasshopper scenes: aggression is all front. It is a questionable message. In reality, kids who confront bullies may find they win, or they may get beaten to a pulp: some bullies are tough.We soon realise that the fight is a performance in an insect circus: but that the snivelling isn't a part of the act. The circus is losing money. Through a quick succession of argumentative, vain, childish male characters, we learn why the circus has problems. The two females - the spider and the butterfly - don't share the blame.There are a couple of heckling male flies in the audience. Their comments are not only unhelpful, they are also sexist, referring lewdly to the ladybird who they believe to be female. Or perhaps they are joking about this. No females behave in an overtly sexist manner in the film, so sexism is being portrayed as a male trait. The ladybird is male, and doesn't like being mistaken for a female. His reaction is unduly aggressive, i.e. he exaggerates his maleness. This is instantly recognisable as a portrayal of male sexual identity crisis: but anyone who doubts this should note that at the end of the film we are told he is now \"in touch with his feminine side\".We learn that the beetle's name is Dim, i.e. he is stupid, as well as aggressive, bullying and cowardly. None of the females have such derogatory names. This is not to suggest that every single negative quality is associated with males, and vice-versa. Flik in particular is brave, intelligent and resourceful. However the very few female weaknesses are both relatively trivial and justified, for example the princess's impatience with Flik. All of the male characters, on the other hand, are at best deeply flawed.The ants win the battle. \"Nature has a certain order\", the princess tells Hopper. Females, it seems, head this film's view of that order. The final scene is in part entirely natural: hopper ends up being fed to some chicks. But it is made very clear that he is still alive, which may not be very realistic. His screams are certainly not realistic: grasshoppers do not have human male voices. Hopper's demise is merely another example of trivialising male death - even hideous death - in the name of entertainment. In this case, entertainment for children.Most films would have ended with the male and female leads beginning a relationship, but this one is so steeped in 1990s political correctness that it can't allow that to happen - despite the hints earlier in the film, and even with the female in the superior role. The final message, then, is that women do not need men.A Bug's Life is an entertaining film whose animation is never less than astonishing. The closing credits alone are amazing. Nevertheless it is a consistently sexist portrayal of gender roles."], ["This movie is so underrated.", "At first, when it came out, \"A Bug's Life was my least favorite Pixar film.

(Listen to just the music on the DVD)Kevin Spacey did the voice of Hopper, the leader of the grasshopper gang. He did a great speech at the grasshopper's hideout, and I really liked it when he did that funny scene with Molt at the anthill. A Bug's Life is given my full approval, and I recommend it for everyone."], ["Yet another Pixar success", "First off, let's get the technical details out of the way. Like all Pixar films, A Bug's Life looks fantastic. The animation is bold and bright, giving its anthropomorphic bugs the usual 3D rendering process that Pixar first showed the world with its first picture, Toy Story. Also, the film does a fairly convincing job with fire in the film, a tricky element to capture with animation.The voice actors all do a great job fleshing out their characters, and do so without upstaging their characters. Unlike other recent animated films, where the animators chose to tailor the animated figure to the actor, the actor tailor their performances to the animated figure. Kevin Spacey as the villainous Hopper is a particular standout, along with David Hyde Pierce's comedic performance as Slim.The story itself is engaging, following the protagonist ant, Flik (Dave Foley), in his attempt to redeem himself in the eyes of the colony by finding other insects to help him ward off the grasshopper gang that torments them. In this attempt, he stumbles across a group of fun and lovable circus bugs (a collection including a male ladybug, a preying mantis, a black widow spider, a gypsy moth, a walking stick-bug, a caterpillar, a dung beetle, and a couple pillbugs), who come back to the colony with him in a misunderstanding. Eventually, everyone teams up to save the day. Flik's journey to \"the city\" where he finds these bugs is the funniest part of the movie, and a perfect example of how an animated film can use sight gags for great comedic effect, without having them dominate the entire narrative structure.My favourite parts of the movie are when the bugs acted like bugs (mosquitoes flying into bug zappers, ants losing it when separated from the colony, flies having 24 hours to live). These parts are quite clever and contribute to some of the genuine laughs of the film. However, while a fun movie, and a great family movie, this movie doesn't quite capture the high levels of quality of other Pixar works like Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. Of all of Pixar's films, this one is probably the most kid-centric and has the least to offer for adults. Which, is to be expected since it's about bugs. Kids love bugs. Because kids are weird.Which makes it a perfect film for kids, but merely a pleasant film for the rest of us. I enjoyed it, but didn't love it."], ["More than a kid's story", "A Bug's Life is more than a kid's story much in the same way as is Antz. It's an allegory of class struggle for certain, but it is focused on the fact that the long-range agenda of global Elite depend on the faithful, mindless labor of the 99.9999999% of the world population which are not among the Elite. There is a school of thought predicated on the model of the beehive which says that all non-elitists are the drones, the worker bees and the Elite-- characterized by their voracious appetites for increasing power and wealth, are the hive keepers. A Bug's Life points out that the model only works when the drones and the ants and the lower classes work without a thought above their own existence. The story drives home the point that if education and thought are added to the colony then individualism and ensuing a revolution of government is the result. The Ants utilize technology (the bird they built), surprise and a united front to take their stand. The Divine, as demonstrated by the living bird's devouring Hopper, blesses their actions. A Bug's Life may indeed be for children; The Lost Children of Democracy; the oppressed orphans of God; the hypnotized colony child-like drones without whom the Elite could not survive.

We have here two little movies that set all-new standards in cartoon animation. Now, I'm finally glad that Disney and Pixar waited three years by not leaking out their secrets kept behind locked doors, and A BUG'S LIFE is ultimately worth the impatience. This is the best looking 3-D showcase I've seen so far, even surpassing ANTZ, and has applied the same technical formula that TOY STORY gave to us. Of course, there are going to be more and better 3-D movies coming our way, but we're already tasting the future right now.It will be interesting to point out the comparisons between A BUG'S LIFE and ANTZ, both that has tiny little ants that appear large when seen off a projection television. ANTZ was a tried-and-true effort by newcomer Dream Works SKG; it just wasn't satisfying enough to hold its appeal to everyone, not even the children. It was also a little too slow in its animation, and was keen enough to make a Hollywoodian image for itself. Or even \"Woodian\", as in Woody Allen. It needed a lot more bite than it could chew, but that's ANTZ.Here, in A BUG'S LIFE, \"family\" entertainment is a whole definition not just for its intelligent sense of humor, but in the way Pixar established a whole new environment for animators to take better advantage of handling three-dimensional objects and landscapes. You want a lifelike cartoon to become a surrealistic universe that's far beyond our imagination. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo would be wandering around reflections of the sun and getting lost in the dark shadows. It's amazing how fast and slick this movie goes on its motions of ants running and birds flying even with colors that appear and shine as a glossy liquid. Whatever more there is to the tantalizing visual quality, it's something we all are going to look forward to the next few years, and it could threaten to dethrone the traditional cartoon as we know it. Tempting but frightening words, aren't they?The visuals aren't the only best things about it, but you can't knock down Disney for its timeless heritage of magical fun-filled wizardry. Let's face it, the movie looks so good enough to burst a chuckle or two. Or, if you handle it, say 99! Just as appealing to grown-ups as it is to children, the comedy relief bodes extremely well for an animated movie running on ultra-high speed microchips. It makes a new statement for the term \"ladybug\", which is sure to fool many! This is the finest example of creativity and delightfulness in a \"family\" picture sitting next to the original BABE. Sure, we can handle the modernization of its jokes any time!There is just one quibble though: the celebrities give this the all-too familiar voice of Hollywood. I wish there were more talented voice acts to liven up this brilliant looking movie a la creme rather than hiring overpaid TV stars and film actors. Oh well, at least they contributed to the characters with all their diligence.For those sitting in the front row near the boxing ring watching the fight and have kept track of the action, you'll see why A BUG'S LIFE wins over ANTZ by a stunning knockout in the first round, and so does Disney. I hate to question about Dream Works' further potential, but the studio sure has a long, long way to go before managing itself as a triumphant pioneer in \"family\" entertainment. It may not become the next \"Disney\" than we'd least anticipate.And for a while, you'd believe I'd give this one the undisputed title as \"The Greatest Motion Picture Ever Made\"! Not exactly!

By this, we mean they have significance and nourish the growing mind with inspiration, motivation, or teach something.  The stories need not be seminal but should at least bring some value to the reader or audience. This is the case, for example, in Pinocchio, where a puppet loved life so much it wanted to be a real boy and by its goodness became one. In A Bug's Life, we find nothing even approximating a meaningful story.  It is tragic because the producing studio, Pixar, has developed the finest graphic animation in the world today in character renderings.That the studio limits itself to children's audiences is their choice and certainly, although more limited than a crossover or a family market the child market still yields enough box office to keep the doors open. Why they have chosen to produce superficial stories, however, so flat and wafer thin they will not have legs for the future, is a mystery.We hope that at some point this remarkably talented group of animators will somehow mature into a shop with a strong story group that can manage to locate a good source of literature to mount with their beautiful artistry.

There's nothing really wrong with it. It is just a little dull.A Bug's Life centres on the life of a bug. Funny that. Name of Flick. Flick's ant colony gets attacked by grasshoppers, seemingly frequently. They exploit them for food. When the ants try to stand up for themselves, they get intimidated and the grasshoppers demand their entire food supply.However, the grasshoppers don't really feel like a threat. I kept thinking that with the number of ants in the colony, they could easily defeat the band of 20 grasshoppers. And at one point in the movie the grasshoppers literally spell it out, but for some reason it goes nowhere.The circus characters are supposed to be quirky and funny. I personally don't find \"look at how stupid I am\" humour to be funny and the circus is filled with this. It felt like irony to me. Really the only character who is funny is the ladybird. The delivery of his lines and his comic timing is almost perfect. However, it saddens me that it wasn't achieved by the other characters. They became reduced to a few character traits and little depth of personality.And finally, the plot has two clich\u00e9s that I really cannot abide in a film. Firstly, the plot hinges on the character overhearing the master plan of the grasshoppers, who just happen to be talking about it out loud, in detail, for no reason. It just didn't make sense. And secondly, the bugs aren't really responsible for their own victory. The bird just happened to be there and just happened to need to feed its baby birds that just conveniently hatched very recently. It didn't feel calculated or planned, which frustrated me.Overall, I think A Bug's Life is OK. I would be mad about having to watch it again.

I don't want to take away anything from the monumental effort that goes into making any form of animated film, but the film does look pretty dated now. The tree and plant effects are pretty convincing still but the characters, particularly facially have a dull plastic-ness to them. There's a \"dead behind the eyes\" look to them that fortunately Pixar managed to overcome pretty quickly going forward from here.That's not the only problem though. The storyline is pedestrian and familiar given it's a reworking of \"Seven Samurai\" or perhaps more closely \"Three Amigos\", and the script lacking in genuine moments of humour. There's a dissonance between the world that the Ants inhabit - essentially, just an empty hole in the ground, and the trash reconfigured to reflect the human world that the rest of the insects have, with bars, restaurants and circuses.I don't want to go overboard with my criticism, there's no one area so spectacularly awful as to undermine the film, it's just that the experience of the film is consistently underwhelming."], ["Exceptionally entertaining", "I think this film is quite amusing.

I remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's, but I never actually saw it until November 2006. I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time.

The type that can only happen in Hollywood. Two computer animated films were released simultaneously about the world of ants. First off was DreamWorks Antz, an extremely entertaining journey into the social hierarchy of an ant colony. And A Bug's Life from those geniuses at Pixar.Any Pixar film is worth a watch because they're a delight in just about every respect. Flawless animation. Involving plots. Well defined characters. But most importantly, that shrewd level of intelligence that constantly keeps Pixar head and shoulders above other animated fare.But A Bug's Life is that rare thing. A Pixar disappointment. Its not a bad film. Pixar have never made an outright terrible film. Even the indifferent response to Cars seemed unwarranted to me.But A Bug's Life is a Pixar film that left me cold. Perhaps if I hadn't seen Antz first I might have liked it more, but somehow I doubt it. Because Antz is the type of film A Bug's Life wants to be but isn't. Its the one time where DreamWorks got one over on Pixar, instead of nipping at their coattails.Antz was a film conducted with a mind-boggling sense of detail. It convinced you there was a whole micro-sized world there beneath our feet. The failing of A Bug's Life is its story is so thin. It doesn't have the ambitious scope of most Pixar films, and its characters are some of the studio's most forgettable.ABL, it has to be said, falls into some very predictable storytelling. You can almost see the clich\u00e9s being wheeled into place. The underdog hero. The comic sidekicks. The dastardly villain. There are none of the usual songs that Disney love so much, but ABL might have benefited from some.The comparisons to Antz are sadly unavoidable. Since it gets right what ABL gets so wrong, they make interesting bedfellows. Although I'm not much of a fan of Woody Allen, he was perfectly cast as the hero of Antz. A put upon ant suffering from peer pressure and his own neurosis. The hero of ABL feels like a lesser developed version of the same character.Flik, along with all the ants in his colony gather food for a gang of bullying grasshoppers every season. When Flik's bumbling puts a spanner in the works, Hopper (voiced by Kevin Spacey) the leader of the grasshoppers, demands an increase in their yearly supply.Flik refuses to stand by and watch his people work they're way into starvation, so he goes off to find help, and brings back a bumbling circus troupe of insects. But it doesn't take long for Flik to learn the truth about his would be saviours. Or for them to learn the real reason they've been brought to the colony.Even the most committed Pixar fan will probably be disappointed with A Bug's Life. A lot of people say Cars was the first fall from grace for the mighty Pixar. This isn't true. ABL was the first dip in quality for this great studio. Fortunately a rarity for Pixar.ABL is a film that cruises in neutral for far too long. Visually its a treat. Just like any Pixar film. But I preferred Antz' gritty, down and dirty aesthetic. They looked like real ants. The ones here are much too colourful and cuddly. They're much too user-friendly.The best type of Pixar film is one that opens itself up to a world of possibilities. Finding Nemo presented us with a breathtaking ocean world. The superb Toy Story 2 (also underrated in my opinion) brought Woody and Buzz Lightyear out of the confines of a kids bedroom and into the big wide world where they had one hell of a rollicking adventure!Because ABL stays in one place for so long the film suffers as a result. Perhaps if it had some engaging characters to focus on, it might have compensated. But nobody here registered with me that much. In fact as I write this, I can't even remember half of they're names.Flik is pretty disposable as a hero. So is the Ant Queen and Princess. And the circus troupe, though voiced by true talent like David Hyde Pierce and Denis Leary, is never allowed to cut loose.The only actor who gets into the show with any lasting impression is Kevin Spacey. He makes Hopper wonderfully loathsome. The type of villain you really love to hate. And his comeuppance is very satisfying (if a bit grisly by Disney's standards).What's missing from A Bug's Life is the smoothness Pixar films usually flow with. There's not a solid enough hook to hang the story from, like there was with Buzz Lightyear finding out he was only a toy. Or little Nemo getting lost in the vast depths of the ocean. A few nice ideas here and there (like a scarily realistic moving bird and some genuinely funny outtakes over the end credits) but A Bug's Life is by far Pixar's most disappointing film."], ["The Animation is Occasionally Superb but the Story is Stupid", "This is another in a long line of Hollywood efforts where the gimmick is everything and the substance is sadly lacking. A schmaltzy cartoon, it is too frequently annoying and occasionally aggravating, yet there are moments where it rises to near-perfection. We can do without the ants, for there is nothing special about them, reflecting Hollywood's view of people as mindless, fear-driven conformists. The lead character is supposed to be imaginative and different, but he's written as a screw-up whose silly, mind-numbing antics are just plain foolish. Only a kid wouldn't be bored by him, while in contrast, it takes an intelligent, focused adult to truly appreciate the subtlety of the grasshoppers. The animation, personalities, and dialog are so effective and convincing that it is nothing less than phenomenal. Too bad so much of the script is contrived, predictable, and unoriginal, taking the wonderful parts down with it into a chasm of mediocrity. Those responsible for spoiling what otherwise might have been a first-rate animated classic ought to be horsewhipped.0 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A whole lotta fun!", "After seeing the movie Antz, I was very curious to see A Bug's Life because most people told me that it was better than Antz.

Flic feels like if he goes out and gets some warriors to help the colony gather food, maybe things will go by faster, but he ends up meeting a flea circus of different bugs. He tells them that they are going to a place where they could perform and being appreciated for it and he lies to the colony that they are true warriors, but everything untangles in Flic's lies and the grasshoppers are getting very impatient.A Bug's Life is a great story and excellent animation, I just loved the humor that was used because it was great for kids and adults.

However, the story this time is a little too bland this time to really involve an adult viewer, whereas kids below the age of 10 will probably eat it up. Flik, as voiced by Dave Foley, is just too darn nice and to make him an outcast because he is the most accident-prone ant in the colony will probably strike a chord with a lot of us but it doesn't really make the character funny. All of Pixar's character's from Woody to Mr. Incredible have many quirks but both Flik and the ant princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are too \"normal\".Things pick up a little after Flik goes on his journey outside the colony where he meets the circus bugs but the circus setting in a bugs world has been done so many times that you almost wish that they had chosen a different setting (the factory like in Monster's Inc. could have worked). The misfit bugs are of course comedic distractions from the very real threat that hangs over the Ant colony, that of the abusive grasshoppers who intend to do terrible deeds if they are not given their ill-gotten food. By the way, the leader, Hopper, is the most terrifying creature in a Disney film yet and his ultimate fate (minor spoiler) will probably frighten some kids. The voice of Kevin Spacey was a real surprise because he expresses more emotion here than he usually does in his live-action roles. The less said about Richard Kind the better.When you compare this to the other Ant movie that year, I will say that this is superior in the animation department but as many Disney ventures it is too darn cute this time.

I know when I was a kid I loved it. And even now, I find a few moments in the movie amusing.HOWEVER: The biggest problem with this movie was that it was far, far, FAAR too predictable! I can give you some examples. Right from the get-go, you can predict Princess Ata will become Queen at the end. As soon as you see Princess Dot trying and failing to fly, you know she will be able to do so by the end. When you see everybody hating Flik and his inventions, you know that by the end everyone will love them both. The second you discover Hopper's fear of birds, you know that that is how he will meet his demise. You can also tell that Heimlich will become a butterfly before all is over.I honestly cannot believe how this movie beat \"Antz\" in popularity, when the latter film was an altogether funnier, cleverer, and more entertaining film with a more engaging storyline and characters. I give this movie 5/10, because I don't want to be too harsh on it when it has several redeeming features.

The cutesy heroes are pretty bland, but the evil grasshoppers are wonderfully brought to life, the asynchronous movement of their multiple limbs a joy to behold.  The real thing that's lacking here, certainly compared to 'Wallace and Grommit' (but 'Toy Story' also), is a sense of pacing: as if the film-makers lack the courage to let you simply marvel at their vivid creations, the film is action-packed but fairly monotonous in mood; and again unlike 'Toy Story', the viewer's perception of the characters is not shifted during the course of the film.  These may sound like very 'adult' considerations; but the best animations can appeal to the child in us all.  'A Bug's Life' is superficial even for a children's tale; but fun nonetheless.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Ah Grasshopper", "To be honest I didn`t think I was going to like this animated movie much but I was fairly wrong in my presumption .

The stories that could be used are endless! This story is about an ant colony that has to harvest food for the marauding grasshoppers that fly in every season. One of the ants is Flik (Dave Foley) who has big ideas but is accident prone and when the grasshoppers are about to fly in Flik makes a blunder that destroys the food that was picked for them. The grasshoppers are headed by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and he threatens the ant colony by telling them that when they return next time there had better be double the amount of food. The colony's Queen (Phyllis Diller) and her daughter Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are furious with Flik but he tells them about his plan to combat the grasshoppers. His idea is to leave the colony and venture out to find warrior bugs that he will bring back to fight off Hopper and the rest. They agree so Flik walks off to another area where bugs congregate and eventually he comes across a group of insects that want to help. The insects are ex-circus performers and are unaware that Flik wants them to fight grasshoppers. They think that they are brought in to perform for the colony.This film was directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton who both created \"Toy Story\" and together they are helping to keep Disney's legend alive and prosperous. They have a good memory for the Disney classics of old and there are many observances (Both clear and obscure) of those films. The computer animation at Pixar seems to be getting better and better and a clear sense of this is the incredibly detailed scenes during the rainstorm. These scenes are a marvel to look at and its hard to figure how they could make these images so rich with intimate details. The story is rather amusing and I was reminded of \"The Three Amigos\" and \"High Plains Drifter\" as I watched this. This film came out the same year as \"Antz\" and I guess the comparisons are inevitable but I think that film has a more adult tone to its story. This film is more in line with its targeted audience of much younger viewers but I did enjoy both films for different reasons. Roddy McDowall is the voice of Mr. Soil and this turned out to be the last film that he ever worked on. This is another very entertaining animated film from the great Pixar Studios and probably the main reason for their success is that even though these stories are aimed at a young crowd both adults and children can enjoy them.

All of us as children just KNEW our toys were alive. That they could talk. In turn, we played with them as if they were real. But soon it hit us that they were just pieces of plastic with limbs, and tossed them out. That's what \"Toy Story\" did--it reinvented not only animation, but imagination; it was not only a children's film, but an adult's film, as well. It brought back fond memories of all of our childhood fantasies.But what \"A Bug's Life\" does is simply toss together a few characters and have them bounce jokes off each other. This film, by itself, is excellent, but when compared to something smart, intelligent and witty, such as, say, Pixar's \"Toy Story,\" it looks like pure commercialism; Pixar's only downfall.A small ant named Flick (voiced by Dave Foley) is a real mess; a klutz, so to speak. He and his colony of ants, presided over by a new Queen Ant, are harvesting food for the naughty Evil Grasshoppers who come every year to gather food from the ant's hard work. But because of Flick the harvest is lost, and when the grasshoppers show up they are mad. Hopper, the lead grasshopper (Kevin Spacey) is pretty \"flicked\" off, and demands more hard work and labor. Everyone is mad at Flick...until he hires circus talents to fight off the grasshoppers, and tells the ants they are fierce warriors. Restoring their confidence to fight, the ants set up a series of attacks for when the grasshoppers arrive, until they find out the truth behind Flick's lie(s).\"A Bug's Life,\" like \"Toy Story\" and \"Monsters, Inc.,\" is a fairly simple idea. But, unlike the other Pixar films, it is missing a vital element: identification with the audience. In \"Toy Story\" we identified with the story; we were all kids once and had toys. The story just worked because it played with that.In \"Monsters, Inc.,\" the idea of monsters was played upon. All children at one time or another were scared of monsters under the bed, and by presenting us the monster's side of the story, \"Monsters, Inc.,\" could be enjoyed by both children and adults.And then there's \"A Bug's Life.\" No identification here. How many of us have been bugs before? Exactly. Maybe on a more emotional level we can identify with Flick the Ant, but on a visible basis, we simply cannot. There really is no fun in the storyline.The story/film is above-average in terms of regular animated motion pictures, but in terms of Pixar films, it is simply a film best to be forgotten in Pixar's otherwise strong resume. Let's all hope that \"Finding Nemo,\" Pixar's upcoming summer film, is better than the ads lead to believe, because if I have it correct, I predict another \"A Bug's Life\" for Pixar next year.3.5/5 stars -"], ["Predictable and Forgettable", "Don't let the 'One Line Summary' fool you, we enjoyed watching this and chuckled quite a few times, but the story line was so standard and predictable, it looked like it was put together from a kit.Everything about the characters and the story line was so stereotypical and two dimensional that this movie easily blends into the memory of so many other movies and it is then easily forgotten.If you have kids, they'll enjoy it and you will as well (at least on the first viewing).

Visually, this movie is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. Its environments are far more ambitious than Toy Story's, and they deliver with far more nuance and texture. There are more characters in this movie, and they're a little better played. And the story is cute-- it deals with Flik, an outcast ant (Dave Foley) who is sent away by the colony's princess (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find some \"tough bugs\" to fight off the oppressive grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who steal the ants' food. Flik finds a bunch of circus-performer bugs, and mistakes them for fighters, and takes them back to the colony to save the bugs from the grasshoppers. Humor follows. Humor for the whole family. This film has great moments, like when the ants can't figure out how to get around a leaf that has fallen in front of them(although I didn't quite get that, since I would think the ants could see over the leaf, but I guess I was putting too much thought into it.) As many great visual moments as the film has, I just couldn't help feel that it's trapped by the Disney formula of one unlikely hero rising above \"it all\" to save the day. Again, the animation is wonderful and, to be honest, although it's more safe feeling than \"Antz\", \"A Bug's Life\" does do a better job at providing the scope of this miniature world, from the leaves and grass to the stones and ant tunnels.  I did like the fact that the film is in the wide 2.35:1 ratio, making the wide spaces of the grassy colony and the insect city more fascinating to watch.  High marks once again. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack never misses a beat. All of the dialogue comes from the position of its speaker on screen. Sometimes stereo effects are very hot or cold-- they're either all the way right, all the way left, or straight center. Not the case here. If a character so much as turns his or her head while speaking, it's reflected in the sound field. Excellent.  And the score by Randy Newman sounds great and never overpowers the dialogue or sound.

The art direction stylises the world of rural insects subtly but surely; and, although I can't help thinking it was a mistake to include any evidence of HUMAN civilisation, that was beautifully done, too. And I applaud the courageous decision to avoid pointless sophistication when designing the insects themselves: they have exactly the robotic design one would expect of creatures with exoskeletons, they move with a minimum of squash and stretch, yet they are not at all lacking in humanity.  Any aspect of the visuals I have forgotten to mention probably deserves praise, too. (With the possible exception of the ladybug design.)That aside, this is a ninety-six minute film that wants to be three hours in length. Compression has wrenched it out of shape.  It's a mess; and the computer-generated equivalent of fine camera-work and competent performances can't save it.  With a film that tries to do so many contradictory things with its allotted time it's difficult to know where to begin.Take Flik, the social misfit who makes good. Many of the crimes for which the colony rejects him are, in fact, serious ones: he DOES lie to them, he DOES wreak real havoc, he IS dangerous. This shouldn't stop him from being a sympathetic hero, of course. But it ought to give us pause. If his failings are real, which they are, and integral to the plot, which they are, they ought to have more than a few seconds of screen time devoted to them. Ideally, they ought to be resolved.Or take the civilisation-versus-barbarians theme, which the film's climax retrospectively underlines, but which is hardly even mentioned beforehand. Or take the relationship between Flik and the princess, which is never defined, which changes from scene to scene, but which, we are led to believe, is a central part of the story. What IS the story, anyway? It's hard to see for all the sub-plots. Or for all the characters. I don't object to crowding the world with so many characters and then paying attention to each of them in turn, but it takes a lot more than 96 minutes to do this kind of thing properly.Despite trying to do too many things at once and doing none of them well, \"A Bug's Life\" has some thrilling moments.  It's because of them that I'm reluctant to dismiss the film as a turkey -- well, let's be fair, a chicken -- in peacock's feathers. It's not that the film is positively BAD: it's just that it fails (visuals aside) to be positively good, as it's so obviously trying to be.One last note: I know people liked the \"bloopers\" at the end, but having seen \"Toy Story 2\", I think they were a mistake.  The gag suited the Toy Story world better. Toys are MEANT to be part of games of make-believe: they are \"acting\" almost all the time, so treating them as actors in the end credits doesn't jar. It sure jars in \"A Bug's Life\", though."], ["Good, but not great", "Of course, comparison between this film and the superior (my opinion) Antz is inevitable, but I think other than the fact that they're computer animated and have to do with ants, they have very little in common. They're completely different stories, if Antz is Metropolis, this film is The Seven Samurai (or The Magnificent Seven if you prefer).  Not to say this film is a Seven Samurai remake, other than the concept of a besiged village hiring warriors, it really doesn't have anything in common with Kurosawa's film.I really did like the fact that Antz was PG, and had an \"edge\" to it, I'm really glad that people are starting to see that animation need not be just for kids, in Europe and Japan, this is not a new idea.  A Bug's Life is much more of a kid's film by comparison, but that didn't keep me from liking it. I do have some complaints though, I didn't find Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) to be a very strong lead character, I thought Woody Allen's Z was a much better lead.  Another thing I didn't like was the character designs, much too \"cute\".  Why are the ants blue?  I have never seen a blue ant, or a four-legged one (actually, these are more two-armed, two-legged).  The world of Antz had a real sense of danger to it, that I think was only hinted at in this film.Technically, the film is flawless, I think the quality of the animation is one area where Antz and this film may tie.  The animation in this film is very good, some of the characters almost look more like very smooth claymation than CGI.  I think computer animation really does it's job when you don't think about it coming from a computer, and I had moments of that feeling watching this film.  As to be expected from a digital-to-digital transfer, the DVD looks beautiful.  The two sets of \"outtakes\" during the end credits are pretty clever, if you watch the film for the first time on DVD, watch the movie before you watch they outtakes, they're funnier that way.  The short \"Geri's Game\" that precedes the film is a real gem, too (I enjoyed Geri's cameo appearance in Toy Story II).This film is definately worth seeing if you're a fan of computer animation, but don't expect Antz, I really wish the two films had been released further apart.  Also, if you like insect movies, also check out the French documentary Microcosmos."], ["A film for children aged 4 to 84", "This is one of those real rarities - a true family film which REALLY CAN be enjoyed by the whole family. It has enough cute, funny characters and an easy-to-follow, eventful plot to keep the kids amused, while at the same time it also boasts a level of sophistication and subtle, adult humour to appeal to the grown-ups as well. The colourful animation and lots of subtle, clever details make this film a joy to watch again and again. My wife and I (we're both into our 30s) were knocked out by this movie and - like a couple of schoolkids - we can't wait for the inevitable \"Bug's Life 2\" which hopefully won't be too long in coming.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Fabulous!", "I'm sorry I missed this in the theaters. But I finally rented the video last night and was very glad I did. It's been a long time since any movie has managed to get through a lifetime of emotional armor and get me to laugh out loud so often.And not just laughs. It's a truly hopeful and optimistic view of an individual's struggle to belong, to give and accept love. I hate the word heartwarming because it gets so overused. But that is exactly the effect it had on me!0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["A great movie for everyone!", "\"A Bugs Life\" is a great movie, and people of all ages with like it! first there's the computer animation which is spectacular, and then there's the plot with so much heart and characters who are truly funny! (Like Flick, Princess Atta and Heimlich!).And make sure you watch the HILARIOUS outtakes at the end! \"Somebody put that thing in my car!\"My rating: 9 out of 100 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["OK, but clearly for kids", "Finally saw this movie on DVD. I enjoyed Antz more, primarily because it had more of an adult sensibility (the importance of being an individual vs. A Bug's Life's cliched \"help the colony\"). Also, I thought the animation in Antz was better. It was more \"wow\" because it seemed realistic. ABL was cartoony (the ants were blue!). I figure this was due to Disney's influence. Toy Story, made before Disney came on board, was edgier.0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Rubbish , I am sorry but it's awful!", "This was one of the biggest movie letdowns that I have seen. It was so boring! I am 15 and maybe I'm a little old to watch this- but that doesn't make sense when I still enjoy the Little Mermaid. Sorry, but if you want to hear voices you have heard of an and action, see ANTZ by far superior. Great for Kids, probably, but if I hear anoter song about how much we all love each other I am going to SCREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was diabolical!! The jokes unfunny and brilliant animation is no substitute for a plot is it now.....0 out of 1 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"], ["Even the kids lost interest half way through the film!", "The characters were cleverly animated, but the story was just not that interesting. Better suited for a TV show of 30 or 60 minutes - not the extravaganza we were expecting after all of the hype.0 out of 3 found this helpful.Was this review helpful?Sign into vote.Permalink"]]}
