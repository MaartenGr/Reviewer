{"ratings": 1, "review_text": "Nothing comes at night. If you read the positive reviews for this movie they like to pretend you should imagine what would come at night. I did not pay $13 a ticket to imagine anything. On top of that, one of the main characters is left tied to a tree through a night or 2 and guess what... Nothing comes to eat him, make him sick, or even tickle his toes. We saw this movie at the Alamo Draft House and I was very confused when they started handing out checks as that usually happens after the climax of a movie, and this movie never had that. To sum the movie up, his grandpa is put down like a sick animal at the start of the movie then nothing happens for about 20 minutes. Some guy shows up at his house by breaking in, they go to pick up this guys family and some goats. While on the road, they run in to a couple of guys who they beat up and kill. At this point, they lead you to believe the guy who wandered up to his house knew the people in the forest, but they just ignore that and bring the guys family and goats home. Then you spend another 20 minutes with nothing happening and then the dog runs away. What did the dog run away to chase? You never find out. The dog shows up sick a few nights later and some how this \"door that only the dad has a key to gets unlocked\". How did that happen and why did everybody blame the kid when the dad has the only key? Well, if you asked that, you will never find out because they just go \"Oh well, lets all go to our separate rooms\". While in their rooms the mom hugs and kisses her kid, the kid who touched the other little kid. Why did the kid die at the end from the disease and the mom not die? How is the disease spread? Nobody took proper precautions to prevent the spread of a disease. Putting a mask on for a few minutes doesn't protect you if it's airborne as you are all still hanging out together. Hugging and kissing your kid who may be infected is also an easy way to get the virus, disease, whatever it was. Save your money, this movie is full of plot holes, almost no story and just plain sucked. I am disappointing I didn't go see the house instead. That one got bad reviews, but at least I would have known that going in to it and wouldn't have been lead to believe this movie was going to be good by a bunch of lying hipsters.

", "This film performs quite the amazing job of tightly illustrating the corruption of one's humanity in a film. Not only that, but said corruption happening inside a family dynamic.", "The mysteriousness and lack of clarification of the film serves as the fundament for building an allegory. This is not a film about an apocalypse per se, you don't get any nitty gritty details about what the virus is, where it comes from, how many it has killed, what the news had to say about it. This is a film about a family having to withstand a powerful destructive force coming from the outside, and how they are trying to protect themselves from it. This is the reason why everything is left vague, for the purpose of generalization, for the purpose of allegory, for the purpose of allowing the spectator to fill in the details themselves with their experiences. The vagueness allows for a much larger array of empathy. Should the film fall short in terms of execution, then it would indeed fall flat, and the allegory would dissipate. This film, however, is very carefully calibrated, and it is the audience that disappoints, not the movie. It disappoints through unwillingness to process information and sensations by themselves, but rather being locked into a mode in which they just expect everything to always be explained to them so as they can be entertained and not use their brains. ", "The film begins with the execution of the sick grandpa. The following discussion is about how the 17 year old son should not have to be exposed to such atrocities. The very first issue in the film is about protecting the son. However in the night, the son keeps having the worst nightmares, mostly about corruption in one form or another, about getting diseased. His first nightmare begins from a painting of Breugel's, then in another scene we see another painting of Breugel's, Hunters in the Snow, a painting with a rich history in cinema. Tarkovsky used it in Solaris as the peak of the sensation of humanity desired by the astronaut's clone-wife. Lars von Trier burned it in Melancholia as the humanity in that film was being consumed by disease as well. The director here uses it knowingly, no doubt, to reinforce the question of one's humanity. ", "The disease in the film is irrelevant. The disease can be whatever you want it to be, it's Trump. If you wanna know what comes at night, the IT, well it's Trump, OK? It's the corrosion and corruption of today's world in regards to our humanity. The family dynamic is organized in such a way that what is of utmost importance is to protect the son from the disease. From the Trump disease. From the terribleness-that- is-in-this-world disease. The vagueness of it all was not satisfactory for me either for the majority of the film. When it really clicked, however, was right at the very end, as the first time that the son shows that he has the disease is right after his father shoots the child and the mother. Then he gets a nosebleed. Then he is infected. This film is quite spectacular for having illustrated this paradox of organizing your life around protecting your son, only to have that very organizing be the thing that ultimately corrupts your son. ", "It is a highly potent tragic allegory. One that requires a minimum amount of thought and effort to feel. Something that is far too excessive to ask of an audience nowadays apparently. The film offers no solutions, it just offers the proposal of contemplating this paradox, one that I am sure most of us are engaged in, in one form or another in our lives as well. This is why this film is so potent, because if only you would think for a moment you would realize that this paradox of protection is universal, and it doesn't need an apocalypse to occur. It just needs one to be such virtuously illustrated.", "The first thing worth mentioning about this film is that it is not a horror film at all. The film was completely mismarketed as another run of the mill horror film on purpose. This did two things. It secured the film a nation wide theater release which it surely wouldn't have gotten otherwise, and it baited in a larger, more casual audience that was expecting the exact opposite of what it was.", "Basically, going to see this movie is like ordering a greasy double decker burger with fries and a soft drink... but instead you get an exquisite entree of fresh garden vegetables prepared by a three star Michelin chef. Very few of these people will have the palate or taste for it, in fact most of them will be upset.", "This film is probably the most realistic post apocalyptic story I have ever come across. Anyone who knows the frequency and probabilities of solar flairs and what they would do to our civilization has probably played out scenarios in their head that are almost identical to the plot of this movie.", "It is this highest degree of realism in the unfolding of the plot and what happens between the characters that makes this film so engaging and captivating. As a work of craft, the film is a remarkable. It is so beautifully shot and the acting never drops below A+ quality for a single moment.

Easily one of the most laughable d-movies of the universe. Save your money and just buy something tasty to eat and enjoy instead.", "The movie does not tell you much about what's going on, yet leaves you to believe there is a sickness that will be the focus of the horror. Technically it is, but not how I thought when I enter the movie. It's a horror movie but it's more of a psychological thriller. One of those one set areas films where it's all about character interaction and how good the actors are in it.", "They were pretty good. I was expecting it to be darker, or maybe a different type of dark with more emphasis of the darkness of the monster which I did not get. More like the darkness of the soul of man, when put in a desperate situation.", "Still well played to the very end, but it can be a little iffy for those expecting something not so different in there horror.", "http://cinemagardens.com", "Recently, the thriller and horror film genre has been producing A+ work, through films like \"Don't Breath\" and \"Get Out.\" The pacing of such films builds to different peaks with an ultimate climax that is unexpected, yet enjoyed. \"It Comes at Night\" failed in this department. ", "With incredibly strange pacing, the viewer was left waiting for something that was ultimately never given. The ending summarized is essentially \"don't trust anyone who's not family, because they will bring a disease into our home and kill the character the audience most relates with.\"", "And some point after the film, I realized that the filmmakers intended for me to feel sad at the end. Sad for the nice family who was killed, sad for the baby that was shot, sad for the nice boy who got the disease, sad for the mother and father for having to kill him. But the only time I genuinely felt sad was when the dog died. And that's saying something", "This was beautifully created and a suspenseful setting but was deeply lacking in storyline. So little actually occurred that I was already confused 40 mins in. If it weren't for Joel Edgerton I would have shut this down 1/3 of the way in. It was confusing, incongruent and frankly a little boring. I patiently waited though and saw it through. Alas the climax was so disappointing I was in shock... and it didn't even happen at night!!! What the hell was coming at night??? Nothing came... even during the day. Not cool... not a horror film, barely a thriller, just a shame.", "\"Do you have any idea what's going on out there?\"", "Early on in director Trey Edward Shults' It Comes at Night, Joel Edgerton's Paul asks Christopher Abbott's Will this question. All Will can do is shake his head. For the majority of the film, the audience is left in the dark as well, with Shults refusing to provide easy answers and instead forcing the audience to grapple with the world and moral dilemmas that he introduces. Set in a near-future where a virulent disease has ravaged the country, Shults' film focuses on two families struggling to survive in the wilderness as paranoia runs amok.", "It Comes at Night has mistakenly been marketed as a horror film. Make no mistake, while the film certainly produces some effective moments of dread and terror, it plays more like a marriage between a psychological thriller and a family drama. Guessing from the initial reactions from the audience in my theater, I have a feeling that the film will play like last year's The VVitch. Not only did audience members walk out halfway through, but as the credits began to roll, I could hear some of them saying \"What the f**k?\" and \"That was underwhelming.\" While audience members might have been expecting a film more akin to say, The Conjuring, as a result of the film's admittedly stellar trailer, Shults forgoes conventional jump scares and instead successfully mixes bone-chilling tension with a disquieting atmosphere.", "Continuing with the comparisons to director Robert Eggers' The VVitch, which was coincidentally also by A24, I found that I preferred Shults' work. While both are armed with lavish cinematography and fantastic performances all around, something about The VVitch did not click with me upon viewing. I found it to be a film that I admired more than I enjoyed in large part due to its achievements in the technical departments. Perhaps it is Brian McOmber's score that makes the difference, which truly shines in Shults' film. Eerily effective, McOmber's score works perfectly in tandem with Drew Daniels' gorgeous photography to create an unsettling feeling throughout the course of the film.", "However, the reason the film works rests solely on the shoulders of the performers, who sink themselves entirely into their roles. Joel Edgerton is the standout here, continuing to impress with every film of his that I watch. Edgerton adeptly portrays Paul, a father whose only goal is to ensure the survival of his family. The way in which he pursues that goal, however, is what lends Paul depth, allowing for riveting observation into the way in which he handles the increasingly tougher circumstances around him. As the film goes on, Edgerton brilliantly communicates the fear and paranoia required of him. Kelvin Harrison Jr. portrays his son Travis, and I was equally impressed by his performance. Despite Edgerton receiving top billing, the soul of the story lies with Travis. By allowing us to see his dreams and capturing his moments alone in the attic, Shults imbues Travis with a melancholic spark of humanity, as he wrestles with being a teenager in a world gone wrong. Additionally, the moral dilemmas that the film explores always keep Travis in mind, using him as the balance between the two families.", "While Carmen Ejogo delivers a great performance as Paul's wife Sarah, Shults' screenplay falls a tad short when it comes to her characterization. While Paul and Travis both feel more realized as individuals, Sarah feels more one-dimensional, which stands in contrast to Riley Keough's Kim. Keough herself, who I first saw in Mad Max: Fury Road continues to impress and she does so again here. Lastly, Christopher Abbott does a stellar job as Kim's husband Will. An early interrogation sequence that features him as the one answering the questions left me shaken, in large part to his performance. Much like Edgerton's Paul, Will's only goal is to ensure the survival of his family, but Shults expertly manages to create tension arising from the irreconcilable differences between the two families.", "Many have complained about the film's seemingly abrupt ending, but I believe that Shults ends it just as he should. The final shot is silent, yet haunting, as the framing communicates more than any dialogue could.", "Shults does not deal in black and white, only in gray. There are no heroes and villains, only regular people struggling to survive amid an unspecified event that has brought humanity to its knees. Straightforward in its storytelling, free from unnecessary twists and turns, the film nonetheless manages to get under the skin. If you have not seen the trailer for Shults' film, but wish to see the film, then do not watch the trailer. However gripping the trailer might be, I am glad that I did not watch it before having seen the film. Go into it fresh, and you will be rewarded with one of the most thrilling films of 2017.", "Rating: 9/10 (Amazing)", "This script must have been written with a mouse button keyboard.a thin bleak story with no horror and bundles of scenes spinning out nowhere.why-what-where and when,we are all untold. the film has no answer to no questions, and ends with an end,a dead end by the way.the directors should take a look back to the 80's and learn the genre.so i am sorry,i wanted to give 0 stars to this movie, but zero does not exist on imdb, so 1 is all i give......", "I can only assume a the the majority of this movies budget, has been spent on paying for reviews?! what annoys me more than wasting the 90 minutes watching this film, is feeling the need to waste more time reviewing it.

But these people are just angry because they didn't watch the movie they wanted to see. ", "It Comes At Night is fantastic. The performances are great all around especially Joel Edgerton. The atmosphere is one of the best I've seen in recent movies. The climax of the movie had my heart racing to the point where I was almost shaking. Trey Edward Shultz uses different aspect ratios to differentiate between the dream and nightmare sequences. When the real world slowly becomes \"a nightmare\" the aspect ratio slowly closes in.", "People are also annoyed by the unanswered questions. But I really enjoyed that. The movie doesn't guide the viewer and help it answer certain questions. The audience is left by themselves to figure out what is happening, which adds to the atmosphere. I could discuss this movie all day and try to figure out the mysteries of this film. Go into this movie with no expectations. Don't be persuaded by any negative reviews. Great job Trey Edward Shultz.", "So what really came at night? Well, nothing ... really nothing!\nI'm a fan of horror films and thrillers, but I was very disappointed with this film.\nI did not understand what the point of the whole film was.\nThe film leaves you with too many open-ended questions. And the end? Well ...", "Except for the location where the film was filmed, and the music during the film, nothing else was exciting or interesting.\nI recommend to those who appreciate and love horror movies like me - do not watch this movie unless you have an hour and a half to pass aimlessly", "To rate It Comes at Night just 1 is harsh, acting and production value (tv-scale) is okay to good, but this movie is/was sold as a horror or mystery movie to me. Not once I felt suspense, horror, shock, adrenaline, whatever emotion or kick. Would they have marketed me the movie as a family-drama with some flu in it, well, maybe I would have decided to give a generous 3 or even a skyrocketing 4. But, as I expected horror and mystery and there was almost none (maybe 1.5%) it is 1. In the first hour, I almost lost the battle against HYPNOS, the mighty ancient Greek god of sleep. Maybe I just should have given in to his powers, none of my dreams are that, well, boring.", "Whatever terror is haunting the world depicted in this movie, in my opinion, it is the ultimate terror of the ultimate boredom. A death more cruel as being burned, drowned and hammer-smashed at the same time and on top losing one's virginity to Vlad, the Impaler. ", "Well, for an experimental short (around 90 secs) the story maybe could have worked but not for a full grown up movie. The night is full of terrors and too much time we just follow some young dude with a slim notion of pursuing a daring career as a Peeping Tom. Oh, may the world fall down, but at least give man enough women to make some more babies ;) ", "Well, the Western society is really on the downhill, one bad movie after another, I can't remember such bad years like 2016 and till now 2017 with such much bad and redundant movie-making. Every connoisseur of fine red wine would have already switched to whiskey pronto or would quit drinking completely if a vintage year would taste that bad. Maybe I should read old books (the new ones are terrible too) and not waste my time with \"movies\". Or I just shoot myself out of pure self-defense against the ultimate boredom this planet seems to head for. ", "And all the praise by so-called pro-critics for this mediocre and redundant movie makes me almost speechless. But wonder I should not, did my poor eyes not see a few weeks ago a list of the best horror movies of all time (based on pro critics and their ratings, if you don't believe it: BEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME is the list called) with Get Out (2017) as numero uno (Shining is 75, Jaws 15, Evil Dead 22), and this on Rotten Tomatoes. This massive inflation of 8s up to 10s or 80 up to 100 percent ratings may have two main reasons: 1) most of the critics are brain-dead, 2) they get a lot of Champagne, girls (boys), and other nice stuff for their nose, aehm, \"work\". Maybe both reasons are interacting somehow - and maybe watching every day bad movies make the less bad movies Oscar material. My conclusion, there is more rotten than just tomatoes in these sad days of decadence and cultural erosion ;)", "Last words: I suggest just ignore my review and watch It Comes at Night, afterward watch The Road (even if you already watched The Road) and I bet you will understand me."]},

That's exactly my predicament with It Comes a Night, a movie marketed as a bump-in-the-night scarefest, but in reality is a deathly serious, brutally difficult critique of fear and isolation. Unlike your basic monster / slasher flick, this will disturb you on a deeper level, something not everyone will want. It's a taut, tight paranoia drama full of stunning visuals and killer performances, in which the monster is the state of dread itself. A small family is holed-up in a cabin deep in the woods, trying to isolate themselves from a world being overtaken by a deathly plague. With the pacing of a southern Gothic tale, the plot unspools with a mysterious naturalism, in which most of the horror elements (decrepit bodies, dark spaces) occur during nightmares and visions. In the reality of the film, the foreboding intensity that overwhelms the screen comes from a skin-crawling sense more than visceral fright. The looks of people's faces. The disturbing framing of a shot. The obscure design of a tree. The impending sense of death. It really is a rare beast of a summer movie, in which the filmmakers aren't just looking for money, but are looking purpose. With flowing camera movements, long-takes, uncomfortable focus and symmetry, and uniquely brilliant lighting, Shults gives us one of the most beautiful and intentionally visual films since possibly his last under-seen gem Krisha. The performances are remarkable, with Edgerton continuing his surprising ascent to being of the most interesting dudes in Hollywood. If you're looking for escapism, you'll be disappointed; if you're looking for greatness, look no further.", "I am so very disappointed with this film. The movie is very very slow. It gives no story line as to what the time frame the world is living in. Where did this \"virus\" come from? Why can the characters go outside without a respirator sometimes, and sometimes not? There is no consistency throughout the movie as to why anything happens. Just when you feel like MAYBE the movie is gearing up for some big revelation to give you answers as to why ANYTHING is happening in the movie (which is not much), you are brought to a huge let down. To not give away much of the movie for anyone who is insistent on seeing this movie and wasting 2 hours of their life that they will never get back..... I will just say this in general. This is not a horror film. This is not a thriller. This is not a suspenseful film. You will spend the entire time waiting for something to happen that never happens.Any questions that you have about incidents in the movie will never be answered. The ending is just as terrible as how it started. No horror, no thrill, no suspense. And finally, NOTHING comes at night.", "Deception, deception, deception. ", "Purely for deceiving audience Trey Edward Shults' should be ashamed. False marketing and delusional trailer prepared movie goer for something absolutely different, than this vacuous \"thriller\". Sure, I get it, the whole beauty according to the critics is the fact that you don't get what you expect, instead you are faced to think about ethics of humanity in post-apocalyptic scenario.

Viewer waits throughout the whole movie for \"It\" to come, but sadly it never comes, at least to the wider audience. Movie leaves on purpose many unanswered questions, but not in a clever and mind-altering way, instead people left the cinema asking themselves \"What, was that it?\".

Do not waste your time or money. Absolute garbage. The movie went nowhere despite having many opportunities to take it in a better direction.

Throughout my life I have been asked a question where there are so many correct answers. I would get so swayed by one, then see the truth of the next and finally be rendered speechless to the most famed question known to man and woman alike. Well today, I have my answer! Countless moments have been wasted in my past attempting to conjure an answer; well no more! You can have the same resolution for the rest of your life! Here is my secret: First, you must watch this movie; second, whenever anyone asks you \"What is the worst movie you have ever seen?\" you will know without any moments wasted. No more asking if the acting in one movie was worse than the directing in the next, or if the story line was as bad as that other movies budget.

Now let me just start out by saying that if you are wanting to see this movie based on the way in which the trailers made it look, then you may very well be disappointed. The film is not by any stretch of the imagination your run of the mill horror flick, truth be told I wouldn't even consider it a horror film at all, it's a psychological thriller. Very big difference between a horror and a psychological thriller. If you typically enjoy psychological thrillers or if you enjoy a movie that has a deeper meaning than your average movie, then you will probably like this one. The plot is centers around two families. The main being a family of three and then there is a second family that is invited to stay with the main family because they're in dire need of supplies. It is set in what I can only assume is post apocalyptic world, based on what the main characters say. There is a known disease going around everywhere and that is why everyone is so desperate and the main family wears gasmasks whenever they go out. The cast includes Joel Edgerton, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Carmen Ejogo, Christopher Abbott, and Riley Keough. The actors all give incredible performances, Harrison Jr., Abbott, and Keough shine the brightest in my opinion, Edgerton is good too, but Harrison, who plays his son exceeds him as far as a compelling performance goes. The directing is on point throughout the entire film, I commend Trey Edward Shults for his clear talent that is displayed here. The movie makes you think, it is a complex and interesting movie to watch and then discuss afterwards. After seeing this film, I want to see The Witch, another well received thriller/horror distributed by A24. 8/10 for It comes at night.", "\"It Comes At Night\" is an incredibly chilling hitchcockian paranoia horror that creeps up on you. Filmmaker Trey Edward Schults whose feature directorial experience prior to this was only \"Krisha,\" brilliantly follows the regular rules that come with crafting an effective character-based psychological thriller while at the same throwing curve balls every now and then, so that at the end, the threat from within becomes even scarier than the outside threat.", "Starring Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbott, Carmen Ejogo and Riley Keough, the story is about a family (husband, wife, and teenage son) who's closed themselves off from the terrors of the world where a certain disease has infected the general population. But their reclusive existence gets put to the test with the arrival of a desperate young family seeking refuge. What starts out as a harmonious agreement turns into suspicion and distrust which then leads to protecting your own family at all cost.", "I think Trey Edward Schults does an excellent job of building the tension, slowly but surely, because halfway trough he kinda flips things over from the concept of us against the world out there into us against each other. So it's written in such a way that from the start is already giving the audiences warning signs to be alert even when the characters seem to have their guard down.

{"ratings": 1, "review_text": "The only problem that stood out to me with this movie was that it was another psych thriller poorly advertised as a monster flick. That said, I wouldn't blame the ads as much in this case because, for one it COULD be a monster flick and secondly the people in the theater with me that had complaints about the movie were all playing on their phones/talking etc. Which brings me to my point really. THE HORROR IN THIS MOVIE IS CHARACTER AND ATMOSPHERE BASED ***Begin possible spoilers*** The movie gives us an apocalyptic feel with a distinct character to represent humanity's past that is being abandoned (the grandfather) a character to represent the ambiguous, potentially non existent future (Andrew) and an in between character that's caught between both and therefore, the best representation of the present in my opinion (Travis). Along with this we have a dog for innocence and two couples of varying age groups caught in the middle and arguably the most affected by it all in the end. I compare this movie to Lord of the Flies merely because it takes a group of humans raised in society and then examines what would happen if that security was ripped away from them. They also, like in Lord of the Flies have a \"monster\" in the woods that drives their fear and leads to them turning on one another in an attempt to restore some order. The reason I say this was an atmosphere movie is because it intentionally makes you feel uneasy and trapped and gives you that fear of the woods that is never even justified. That said, in my opinion and like others reviewers mentioned, we are really just taking a front row seat in Travis's mind. Despite his parents seeming to be the most paranoid, you see Travis's perspective and his facial expressions the most and most importantly, his nightmares. The nightmares are very relevant because they, once again create atmosphere. This group of people feel so unsafe that the sickness is seeping into their minds slowly, starting with their subconscious. Notice Travis is much more expressive in his dreams that in real life at first but as things unfold he becomes paranoid in his waking life as well. Overall, as I left the theater, I looked forward to firstly thinking it over in the car ride home but more importantly, going home and taking a shower. Not only does it give you the 'creepy thing in the woods' sorta feeling but also the 'literally everything and everyone is contaminated' feeling. Definitely thought provoking and worth seeing."},

The story revolves around a small family who comes across another desperate family seeking shelter and supplies as an unknown threat conquers the outside world. In this case, focusing on the complicated relationship between these families in a dying world is fascinating.

While the film (and especially its climax) can be devastating, its unique depiction of mistrust and fear is just unmatched by anything you normally see in the horror genre. Additionally, the film's performances and aesthetic qualities are superb. The cast is uniformly excellent, and their performances are quite thoughtful. The film's cinematography is excellent as well, with a mix of dim lighting as well as natural photography and wide shots. Finally, it wouldn't be a horror film without a score that can really get under your skin. In this movie, the simple but tense score absolutely does.", "Taking almost every problem with modern horror movies and fixing them, \"It Comes At Night\" proves that Shults likely will have a great career as a director ahead of him. It seems to me like future horror films will have a new standard to live up to. 10/10", "I walked into this theater not expecting what we usually see in horror films now a days. Don't get me wrong, I do like modern horror films, but only if they are done right like say The Conjuring 2. I knew going in I was in for something different and my expectations were correct. This is definitely not the typical jump scare, absolutely horrifying film. Its a great and unique physiological movie about a post apocalyptic world that has crumbled civilization\u200b but I loved how they never show the outside world but rather we learn little knowledge from the characters. There are two families living together which are very fleshed out and have many good scenes together which I loved they did. But this movie is not all glitter and kittens. We as an audience, go on a very well made journey to witness how anything strong can crumble as time progresses. I am definitely going to be in the minority as I loved this film. My other family members hated it, but like I said they thought it was going to be completely different than what it really is supposed to be. It comes at night really leaves you using your mind to fit the pieces together so if you like this genre, I think you should check it out.", "If you have trouble sleeping worry no more, just go see this movie!", "'It comes at night' is a wrongly distributed indie drama with one stretched out story line. If you look at movies in a way that only YOU can interpret as a wonderfully unappreciated profound art, then you will absolutely love this movie. If you watch movies to be entertained and you want to have a good time then I suggest you skip this one. ", "As most reviews tell you the movie is slow and it keeps you waiting for something that just never comes. Even the acting reminds you of the acting you saw in an amateur theater organization from school. 'Overacting' is an appropriate term. ", "So, if you like a good horror movie, don't bother. I'm honestly not being pessimistic. I for example was very enthusiastic about \"Don't Breathe\" or \"It Follows\". This movie doesn't belong in the same list.", "My advice? Go watch another movie in theaters, and maybe if you're still curious, watch this one at home some day. Just don't forget your energy drinks.", "David Lynch meets Cormac Mccarthy in It Comes at Night, one of the bleakest horror films to come out in recent memory. Like many great works of post apocalyptic literature, this film is at it's best when it is ignoring the flashy set pieces and instead focuses on an all encompassing feeling of dread that slowly consumes the characters. The few missteps into exploitation and zombie inspired horror can be forgiven because of the feeling of complete loss that we feel throughout the film. ", "Like 28 Days Later, The Road and (ugh) The Walking Dead before it, It Comes at Night is about family, and how the definition of that word would change depending on what the world allows. The film opens with the Paul (Joel Edgerton), the patriarch of a small family, killing a sick man and disposing of the body with his son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr). The killing is a brilliant way to set the tone of the film. It is almost clinically depicted, instead we focus on Travis' fear and pain, and on Paul's unstoppable drive to protect his family. We see the more of the same ideas and images when a scavenger, Will (Christopher Abbott), breaks into the family's isolation. Will has a wife and young son as well, and eventually Paul's family grows to include them. ", "What's great about this movie is that the paranoia doesn't let up. Director Trey Edward Shults fills the film with disturbing dreams and darkness, never giving us enough clarity to be calm and satisfied. Many have expressed anger at this, saying that Shults opens too many doors and has no solutions for how they got that way. I personally loved it. This is a kind of film where it doesn't really matter why things are happening, what matters is what they are revealing about us. ", "What Shults reveals is a deep seated fear of death and hell. At times the film feels surreal; like the characters are all dead, living out a nightmare scenario, trapped forever to live a pointless and painful existence. The gray and black color scheme alone conveys a dulled, trapped existence, similar to the one in Lars Von Trier's Antichrist. That was another film about human interaction in the face of great adversity, and the ultimate failure that comes with it. Shults' camera sells this as well, it moves through the family house like a ghost or god, quietly observing and following light but never drawing attention to itself. The cinema makes us voyeurs, and that is agonizingly clear in this film. ", "Only as the film draws to a close do the cameras become hand-held and the spell begins to break. The ending here is so satisfyingly bleak that saying anything about it would ruin it. I'll say this: it is so so satisfying to watch a film with confidence. Often when a movie threatens us with egregious violence we feel safe in knowing that \"they wouldn't show that, they couldn't\". It Comes at Night is not such a film. This is a dark, disturbing, confident film, one that is deeply watchable and continues to prove that a simple story gives the audience so much more to think about.", "Lame! I still have no idea what comes at night. I'll give kudos to the cinematography. The story is bleak, unimaginative, and the marketing is completely misleading. If you want to learn how man acts under horrible circumstances, just watch The Walking Dead. Don't waste your time with this sh*t show", "I just came from seeing this film which I've been following for some time now. I must say, after seeing Mr. Shults first film Krisha, which was really well crafted. I already knew I would love the tone of this movie. ", "The film jumps right into the belly of serious, right from the first frame. The writing, acting, and overall world is extremely gravitational. You can tell this is a director/writer that spend his time in his head and with his characters.", "There's a strong sense of family before anything cast throughout the film. Although, what has happened to the rest of the world is largely hidden. Which I love, but may be too ambiguous for certain viewers. ", "However, I love the fact of this is where we are, and this is what we have to do to get through it, no matter the cost. Joel Edgerton is amazing in this role, I'm not sure I saw this much genuine no play factor since his film the gift. Also, newcomer Kelvin Harrison Jr really finds his pace as the movie unravels. ", "Although, Carmen Ejogo also pulls off a terrific performance. I found her to be just there in certain areas. But, not so much that I can't say she doesn't help push forth the story. ", "The cinematography of Drew Daniels is beautiful and marries well with the creepy undertones of music by Brian McOmber. Overall this is a film I would watch again as I was immersed in it from beginning to end. This is a true mystery thriller! And I hope you guy find my review helpful. ", "As you can see I didn't dive too deep, because I didn't want to give away any spoilers and felt it's great to just give it a chance and a cold watch.", "I rated it an 8 because nothing is completely perfect :)", "I am going to ***Spoil*** this movie for you because this movie is not good. I don't say it's bad. It's just not good. The drama is OK. You see they build a sort of bond between the two families.", "There's no horror here. After watching the first 10 minutes, the tension made you thought it is going to be like The Walking Dead. You thought maybe it is a monster movie. But half way through, nothing! It's just the two families talking. The dialogue is not boring though. But still, you expect something sinister to come at night.", "The scary bits are all dreams. Dream sequences pss me off. Because most dream sequence are not real. Just a cheap way to scare audience.", "So, there's no 'It'. 'It' doesn't come at all. If you want 'It', wait for 8th September. This so-called horror wanted to piggy back the popularity of recent horrors like Get Out, or Don't Breathe, or It Follows.", "It's not horror. Horror fans, stay clear. If you want to see character development, yes. Do watch.", "Scary killers, gore, entrails and blood spurting, (oh, nudity - he-he): Nope. Nada. Zip.", "Now that is one of the best psychological horror drama movies I have ever seen. I loved it after the first time I watched it and the more I think about this movie the more I like it.", "BUT!", "It was poorly advertised. The trailer shows a typical horror movie in a house with \"something\" outside like zombies, a monster or something like that. The trailer makes a lot of boom, is fast paced and looks like the movie will have some cheap jumpscares. I thought it will be just another OKAY horror film.", "But then I saw this carefully created masterpiece about survival, mistrust, family and fear. This movie is not for everyone. It doesn\u00b4t answer every question directly. It is subtle, thoughtfull, smart and somehow phylosophical.", "If you\u00b4re tired and you just want to watch a simple movie with a simple plot, don\u00b4t watch \"It Comes at Night\". If you just miss some details, it could easyily happen to you that. after the end of the movie, you\u00b4re going to say something like \"What comes at night?\" or \"Nothing happened. What kind of movie is that?\" or \"horrible movie\".", "And that explains all the negative critiques, since a lot of viewers thought that this is going to be a simple horror movie with a typical action third act like thousands of other movies out there. But this movie here is just something completely different and that in a good way.", "So how does one watch \"It Comes At Night\" without being biased by reviews, the trailer or anything else? Well just don\u00b4t expect anything. Just watch it, like you don\u00b4t even know what the title of the movie is. Don\u00b4t even think about my review here. Erase as much as possible, drink some coffee, turn of your phone and be 100% there, just to watch this movie.", "A24, from now until the day I die, I will be watching every single horror movie you buy, you have my word. Are you tired of watching dumb characters making bad decisions and getting themselves killed? Or those that could have survived but eventually died because of their careless moves? Or those predictably loud and annoying jump scares that you have seen in countless horror films and wonder if there could ever be that one movie that would avoid everything mentioned above. Lucky for you, this is that film. It Comes At Night is a psychological horror/thriller/drama that brilliantly avoids a typical, predictable horror clich\u00e9 and shifts itself into being an anti-horror film instead. The characters here are precisely smart, brilliantly developed, and powerfully acted along with the simple, yet twisted survival concept and atmospherically creepy setting, I would seriously pee my pants\u200b if this film is shown in VR format, and proving that sometimes, what is left unseen and untold can be scarier than you might expect. These are what make the film so intriguing to watch as it slowly hooks you to the suspense by squeezing the fear, paranoia, suspicion, and survival instinct of our human nature out to their worst nightmare, which all results in this nail-biting, thrilling final act that will cringe shudder you until the credits roll. Again, this film aims at making the audiences feel desperate and unsettled while piling up their fears from something they don't know or see. So if you are looking for a jumpy scare with loud or random creatures popping up in your face, then this movie is definitely not for you. Overall, with its unusually smart characters, intriguing performances, atmospherically creepy dystopian setting, and suspensefully constructed plot, It Comes At Night is an anti-horror film that effectively succeeds in avoiding all the horror clich\u00e9, both character and story wise, and easily placing itself as the best and smartest horror film so far this year.", ">>A<<", "TWITTER: @moviesmaniaCX", "Please don't read the reviews from the other members of this site and have it sway your interest in seeing this film. A lot of people reviewing the movie were talking about how it isn't \"scary\". You could tell that this movie wasn't going to be a traditional \"horror\" movie from the trailers but it would focus more on the family and the mystery of what \"comes at night.\" If you go into this movie expecting a jump scare filled horror movie you'll be disappointed. If you did any research at all you should know this isn't what you're getting yourself into. It's a great and tense film that will keep your interest throughout the entire thing. Give this movie a shot. It is genuinely creepy and got me on the edge of my seat quite a few times. Great acting, great music and a very intriguing movie as a whole.", "Let me start off by saying this movie doesn't deserve the hate it has received from audience members. Let me also say that the title and marketing were a massive mistake, and I don't blame audience members for being ticked off. The movie promised by the title and trailers is not the movie presented.", "Once you get past these issues, the story itself is quite good. The main characters are believable, and while the premise isn't wholly unique, the film presents a world that is frighteningly realistic occupied by characters worth rooting for. In essence, this is a post apocalyptic film about a plague that has wiped out the civilized world. Our main characters live in a cabin in the woods, getting by. Then another couple with a young child arrives, and things get morally complicated. Who do you trust in that situation? What do you do to protect your family?", "We watch the characters struggle with these questions, and the stakes are always as high as can be. There's some ambiguity to the events in the film that make it rewatchable, and the ending is as sad as it is shocking. This one has stayed with me since I saw it in theaters.", "The goal of the movie wasn't to scare you with blood or with monsters attacking a house at night. If you are disappointed that nothing came at night (and gave it a bad rating for that reason) you need to chill. Real horror doesn't have to be shown anyway; the fear of the unknown is far more potent than just seeing some monster. The real horrors of the movie are the implications of the loss of loved ones and having to go against one's own morals to survive and keep your family safe."]},

The acting was decent but there very little depth to any of the characters. The only thing i really liked about the film was the score/sound design, which was layered with some really interesting sounds. you never actually see or find out what comes at night, if there even is anything. Every time you think your going to get a glimpse of antagonist, the camera zooms in on the sons stupid horrified face. This movie should have gone straight to Netflix.

It does not deal with cheap thrills, really it is a reflection of horror of losing members of your own family, of illness, and the director dealt with his own loss of father to cancer by filming this. So, while not really a master piece, and a bit abstract for average horror lovers, it is a pretty solid work of art, worthy of your time if you are into exploring these kind of issues in a serious way.

Director Trey Edwards Shultz proves that Krisha was not a fluke here but he also proves that storytelling is still a bit of a weak point. It Comes At Night suffers from the same things that Krisha did. It has a weak and thin script but a strong enough idea in it to float it. Despite this, Shultz does a great job with his cast. Much like Krisha, had any other cast been chosen, I doubt this film would be half as good as it is.", "The film's cast is extremely strong and small enough so that you actually care about these characters which is hard to find in horror. Starring Joel Edgerton, Riley Keough, Chris Abbott, Carmen Ejogo and Kelvin Harrison, Jr., the film is electrified through these actors and you can absolutely tell. The story is paper thin but mysterious enough to keep a mild interest. When you combine that with this cast, you have a decent enough horror film that is slightly above your average Netflix fare.", "Overall, It Comes At Night was a bit of a disappointment considering the hype it has. The final product is muddled and confusing but still well acted nonetheless. Joel Edgerton leads a fine cast that gives us some truly terrifying performances which elevates the very thin plot. If you are a fan of slow burn horror films like last year's The Witch, then you might enjoy this one.", "This movie is an anticlimactic, pathetic excuse of cinema. i wouldn't recommend anyone watch it. Nothing is explained the whole movie, no development of plot or characters, and then it just sort of ends. No one should ever be punished enough to have to watch this piece of garbage.", "A24 continues to impress me each time with their films. As soon as one is even announced, whether I know its true intention or not, I want to see and (try to) understand it. I want to know the film's purpose. 'It Comes at Night' puts on a high tensity slow-burning horror show that keeps you on the edge of your seat with every spoken word and/or action that is taken. It is a film that shows human nature's most basic instinct; survival. However, here is yet another disclaimer; this is a slow-burn horror film. It is not 'The Conjuring', it is not a carbon copy of every Hollywood Horror film that spoon feeds jump scares like every PG-13 horror film does. It is a psychological slow-burn horror film. A24 delivers yet another Indie horror film that is a gem within the horror genre.", "'IT COMES AT NIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)", "A psychological horror flick written and directed by sophomore feature filmmaker Trey Edward Shults. It's set in a future world, where an unexplained illness has wiped out a large percentage of the population (and made everyone else paranoid of each other). A family that's survived in isolation, in a secure locked up house, invites another family seeking help to stay with them (despite the severe mistrust they have for them). It stars Joel Edgerton, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Carmen Ejogo, Christopher Abbot, Riley Keough and Griffin Robert Faulkner. The film had it's world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival (in Mount Hood, Oregon), and it's received mostly rave reviews from critics. It's also been a successful hit at the Box Office so far.

Paranoia and mistrust for each other soon tears their uneasy relationship apart though.", "Once again, man is much more dangerous than any plague or monster; that's the basic theme of this horror movie. It's got a few moments of hope, and compassion, but ultimately it's a very disturbing and depressing film. Multiple people walked out of the showing I saw of it, before it was over, and several others vocally expressed their discuss with it when it concluded.

Sarah doesn't want their 17-year-old son to see this, but Paul needed his help loading Bud into and out of the wheel barrow.

I hate history as much as the next guy, but this hints we might learn some\u00adthing from it. Because of the apocalyptic scope of their troubles, I'd want to try biblical history. Let's look at the after\u00admath of the deluge.", "The old world was beset by sin and violence passed on by a corrupted seed; however, (Gen. 6:9) \"Noah was \u0085 perfect in his generations.\" His wife also presumably came from good stock, and they and their three sons Shem, Ham & Japheth along with their three wives were saved from the world\u00adwide punishing flood by riding out the rain in an ark. Noah was 600-years-old and his wife 100 years older when that happened, so she'd quit bearing by when the time came to repopulate the earth, and perhaps a good while before then. Since the mother of Shem and Japheth is mentioned in the book of Jasher, but not the mother of the youngest Ham, speculation has arisen that the latter's mother could have been a hand\u00admaid according to custom, perhaps not of the best seed. At any rate Ham failed the test Noah gave him, but Shem and Japheth passed. (I've elaborated in my review of \"The Dinner.\") Noah blessed Shem\u2014from whom came the Semites\u2014and also Japheth\u2014whose name means enlarge, and whose offspring settled all over\u2014saying, (Gen 10:27) \"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant.\" Canaan was the youngest son of Ham who failed the test, the judgment being delayed for a number of generations.", "Paul in our movie has a namesake Paul in the Bible, a converted Jew self-described as \"an Hebrew of the Hebrews.\" Sarah's biblical name\u00adsake was Abraham's wife. Will and Kim raised goats and chickens and show a fondness for onion soup an ethnic food, so they represent Japheth who spread all over and was to dwell in the tents of Shem (the Semites), as we see here Will's family dwelling in the house of Paul. Canaan included the tribe of Gibeon who in fact became (Joshua 9:23) \"bond\u00admen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water\" to the Israelites, this being preferable to complete annihilation. In this movie hewing wood and pumping water were the two farm tasks shown giving a sense of normalcy.", "Here's the interesting part. One of Ham's other sons (who would also inherit servitude) was Cush, Hebrew for black, who went and settled in Africa, providing a sort of eventual justification for Negro slavery. In \"It Comes At Night\" Paul is white, and his wife is black but could pass as white if one doesn't look too closely. Their son Travis, how\u00adever, through some trick of genetics, has pronounced Negroid features, so that when his (white) dad orders him around, it looks like a white man bossing a black \"boy.\" But Travis is kind of stupid, so our sympathies are that he needs bossing. And this is not politically incorrect, for his dad married a black after all, and pc is based on Thomas Jefferson's all men being created equal, not on the story of Noah. However, racism is based on that story, so from that perspective the film is racist. Racist and politically correct at the same time. Go figure. I give it kudos for cleverness.", "Anyhow, it you're black and you're looking for a film to help make you feel good about yourself, there are plenty of offerings in theaters, which will do just that, but this isn't one of them. Instead, it's mind bending in its simplicity and one I enjoy for what it is. If you like dark films, here's one that might appeal to you for added variety. If you like more upbeat Holly\u00adwood fare, go see something else.", "The acting worked, but was nothing outstanding. The sets and background were elemental.", "\"It Comes At Night\" from Writer/Director Trey Shults is a riveting examination of survival under the most adverse conditions.The basic story is about a family trying to survive in a cabin in the woods while some sort of virus ravages an apocalyptic land. \"Imagine the end of the world\u2014 Now imagine something worse,\" says the A24 press handout.", "In Shults' words: \"The movie is about the unknown and the fear of the unknown. Death is the ultimate unknown.\" So says Writer/Director Trey Shults of his new thriller \"It Comes At Night.\" The minimalist story is not a typical genre thriller, according to Shults, but, as he said (quoting Mies Van Der Rohe), \"Less is more.\" ", "The second man who brings his family to the remote cabin seeking haven and the necessities of life is headed by Will. Will is played by Christopher Abbott, who was excellent in \"James White.\" Will's wife, Kim, is played by Riley Keough (Elvis' granddaughter, \"American Honey\") and his small son Andrew is played by Griffin Robert Faulkner.", "Despite the best intentions of both families portrayed in the film, paranoia and mistrust fester and erupt as the horrors outside creep ever-closer, awakening something hidden and monstrous within Paul as he learns that the protection of his family comes at a huge cost.", "Shults said, during a Q&A following the film's showing in Chicago on June 1st, that he was fascinated with questions about topics like genocide. He is definitely focused on death and man's mortality in this film, which is not about zombies or monsters, but is every bit as horrific as he examines the lengths people will go to to protect their own.", "Since the original impetus for Shults' film came from helping his own father through terminal pancreatic cancer, the mood of the film is grim, grimmer, grimmest. Shults has said that, following his father's death (they had been estranged for 7 years prior), he sat down and wrote and \"It just came spewing out of me.\" He's certainly in good company in musing on the temporary nature of our existence on this planet. ", "But Shults has made this film as scary as anything you'll see this summer. What lengths will a man go to to \"save\" and protect his family? What would happen if we were facing an unbeatable disease with no modern medicines or hospitals to help us? Many in the world are facing these questions right now, in real time, but Shults is still struggling with the deaths of two close family members, with memories which clearly haunt him to this day.", "The uncomfortable subject matter of \"It Comes At Night\", says Shults, is \"drawing from heavy personal experiences and placing it into a fictional narrative, hoping the same emotions come through. At its heart, this is a movie about mortality.\"", "The script for \"It Comes At Night\" was actually written before \"Krisha.\" When \"Krisha\" was a big hit at SXSW, Shults got a 2-picture deal from A24. This is that second film, but he has been learning from the best since the age of 18, working on 3 Terrence Malick films, starting with \"Tree of Life\" in Hawaii.", "The film is beautifully shot and paranoia is justified and created with the skillful use of camera, sound and light (see my interview with Trey Shults on www.TheMovieBlog.com for details). This is a riveting, horrific picture of a future we can only hope never becomes a reality. I am still thinking about it today, four days later. Yet Shults resists calling it a horror film, and believes it is far more about psychological horror than a genre flick with monsters or things that go bump in the night (as they literally do in this one.)", "For some, the questions we are left with as the film ends will cause criticism. There are times at the \"end\" of a piece (remember the finale of \"The Sopranos\"?) when viewers feel they have been shortchanged or cheated by the ending. For me, this was not an issue, as it was pretty clear what was probably going to happen next. Still, I understand those who want more of a \"Breaking Bad\" type of ending, where things are wrapped up neatly and some characters live and some characters die (and spin-offs are even made possible by the \"concluded\" feeling.)", "Two other things that may cause Shults criticism from some sources will be his intentional intermingling of the dream sequences with reality. They will say (truthfully) that it is sometimes difficult to tell what is a dream and what is reality.", "Again, this did not cause me any problems. After listening to Shults explain why this was intentionally done, it made sense. He explained that he saw the dream sequences as a way into Travis' mind. (And Travis = Trey). It is Travis' point-of-view through which we see the story, even though it is his father, Paul (Joel Edgerton), who is dictating the terms of Travis' young life.", "And last, some will say, \"Why is it called 'It Comes At Night'?\" Shults explained that night is the time when he is at his most creative and it was a title that sounded good. Hopefully, he said, it helps put you in the heads of the main characters. It is not a literal interpretation of what occurs in the film but more a metaphor.", "The beginning of a bright future for a gifted filmmaker.", "This is a post apocalyptic movie about two families in a home amid the woods - and outside there is a plague that has killed seemingly most of humanity. These character's have few answers and so the audience gets few answers as well. The two families have a brief opportunity to start a habitat unit where they could potentially create a small civilization and preserve a glimmer of hope for humanity's future - but in the end they fall to paranoia and destroy their future. There is a lot of stuff that makes no sense. The idea is that if you go outside at night the plague can get you *but people go outside anyhow? Also - early on a man hits another man in the head with a gun and he is knocked unconscious - but the idea a gun to the head can knock a character out is textbook bad writing for plot convenience. However - the acting is good - the sound fx are great - the lighting is nice - and there are some really strong moments. I think the moral of the story is that for humanity to survive we have to trust one another - and we may think the terror comes from beyond but it comes from within to destroy us. And if we fail to trust and work together we will sow the seeds of our destruction."]},

The basis of the movie isn't necessarily about finding the answers on the outside, but rather question the relationships and emotions of those who are on the inside. Paranoia drives this movie from start to finish, and those who leave the theater unsatisfied are missing the point of what Shults was trying to create. With a budget of just 5 million dollars, he challenges our subconscious to extend the visual. "},

It's a film that was always going to be misinterpreted to be something else by many audiences and it's not a film that neatly checks off many genre conventions or clich\u00e9s. Even its horror label will be disputed by some. What I got most out of the film was its relentless and unnerving sense of anxiety, paranoia, and fear that runs throughout the whole thing. It's not an easy atmosphere to build constantly throughout a 90 minute-runtime, but Trey Edward Shults actually accomplishes it. This is a fantastic piece of psychological horror and mystery, one to be celebrated."},

{"ratings": 7, "review_text": "First of all, this film was sold as a Horror film, which was a huge mistake. People who go to see those movies aren't really into thinking very much, they just want the jumps and scares, which is fine, but this movie is not that. It doesn't try and scare you, just to scare you, it tries to make you think. I unfortunately have to quote one of the bad reviews on here that says, \"I didn't come to the theater to use my imagination\", which is extraordinarily sad in my opinion, but a truth that filmmakers and marketing directors need to adhere to. The person who goes to see horror films, doesn't like to use their imagination, and this film requires that to some extent. Or maybe it's just that one guy."},
{"ratings": 7, "review_text": "The film is centered around a family of three, locked away in their house in the middle of the forest due to a \"sickness\" that has plagued the outside world. That's all we know, and that's all we need to know, because this isn't the 10,000th zombie apocalypse movie, we all know that movie quite well. This is the movie that deals with human psychology and the paranoia that inflicts us all during a time of crisis. That's the story the director set out to tell. "},

{"ratings": 6, "review_text": "In the near future, a plague is decimating society and Joel Edgerton is living with his family in a well protected house in an isolated rural area. They encounter a young family that needs help, and after some initial mistrust, Edgerton's family takes them into their home. Things seem good, but an incident leads to an atmosphere of fear and mistrust that erupts in violence. This is a very good, slow burning thriller that could have been a masterpiece of sorts if it didn't try to be a horror film too. Horror elements are introduced by a bunch of dreams that Edgerton's son has that are a fairly transparent mechanism for introducing false suspense scenes into a slow building narrative. It's apparent very early on that these are just dreams and have no bearing on the film's reality, so they really just serve as a distraction and a device for introducing empty-headed jump scares. I wasn't too annoyed by them, until the film pulled the old \"I have woken up from dream ... oh no! it's still just a dream!\" crap and then I was more than a little annoyed. After a really emotionally devastating climax, the film lands on a manifestly incoherent conclusion that maybe is supposed to be covered up by a possible dream sequence ... only it's not. It just doesn't make sense and sullies the ending of a really good flick."},

Coming out of it I was very satisfied with the payoff. This isn't the run of the mill horror movie or post-epidemic film we have seen time and time again. While it takes certain tropes from modern day horror movie, it puts a unique spin on them in a way that actually benefits itself rather than feeling like a needless studio note that only hinders the film's intensity like most do today. This movie goes against the norm with its storytelling and scares. The scares don't come from what is shown or even known, but what is unknown. What isn't seen is what supplies the frights."},

Alone at least until a strange family comes to live with them and they learn to work together in order to survive. From there I do not want to say much more if anyone plans to see this film."},
{"ratings": 8, "review_text": "Again, I feel the need to reiterate that this is not a conventional horror film. If you are not a fan of a slow burn and ambiguity then this movie is not for your. Do not expect jump scares left and right or a quick pace to its plot. The writing takes its time and gives just enough throughout to make the viewer well aware that there are dangers, but from where is left open ended. It plays with the audience's perception a bit with what is really going on; whether certain people are lying or not, if someone is actually infected by this virus they're all afraid of, how this virus actually effects the person or persons that contract it.

{"text": ["I think Director Trey Edward Shults perfects tension in this bleak setting. The basis of the movie isn't necessarily about finding the answers on the outside, but rather question the relationships and emotions of those who are on the inside. Paranoia drives this movie from start to finish, and those who leave the theater unsatisfied are missing the point of what Shults was trying to create. With a budget of just 5 million dollars, he challenges our subconscious to extend the visual. ", "My girlfriend and I spent the thirty minute dark car ride home dissecting the underlying theories of the film. This carried over into my sleep with eerie consequences. It was the imagination of possibilities that made it that much more terrifying. ", "I thought actor Kelvin Harrison did a masterful job of relating his fears into a character you not only rooted for, but worried about. It was also proper length which made for an enjoyable watch, one that is hard to erase from your mind.", "Upon finishing It Comes at Night, I knew it would be the type of film that completely divides audiences. It's a film that was always going to be misinterpreted to be something else by many audiences and it's not a film that neatly checks off many genre conventions or clich\u00e9s. Even its horror label will be disputed by some. What I got most out of the film was its relentless and unnerving sense of anxiety, paranoia, and fear that runs throughout the whole thing. It's not an easy atmosphere to build constantly throughout a 90 minute-runtime, but Trey Edward Shults actually accomplishes it. This is a fantastic piece of psychological horror and mystery, one to be celebrated.", "I don't normally write reviews on here, but I saw all the negative feedback and I felt like I should show some love for the film. ", "First of all, this film was sold as a Horror film, which was a huge mistake. People who go to see those movies aren't really into thinking very much, they just want the jumps and scares, which is fine, but this movie is not that. It doesn't try and scare you, just to scare you, it tries to make you think. I unfortunately have to quote one of the bad reviews on here that says, \"I didn't come to the theater to use my imagination\", which is extraordinarily sad in my opinion, but a truth that filmmakers and marketing directors need to adhere to. The person who goes to see horror films, doesn't like to use their imagination, and this film requires that to some extent. Or maybe it's just that one guy.", "The film is centered around a family of three, locked away in their house in the middle of the forest due to a \"sickness\" that has plagued the outside world. That's all we know, and that's all we need to know, because this isn't the 10,000th zombie apocalypse movie, we all know that movie quite well. This is the movie that deals with human psychology and the paranoia that inflicts us all during a time of crisis. That's the story the director set out to tell. ", "The family is joined by another family, and the paranoia unfolds, with who is sick, who's not sick, who's dangerous, and has a very grizzly ending. Not trying to give too much away, but this is extremely similar to the Crucible, or the Hunt, both great stories. ", "The poster design and the trailer were deceptive, I did think I was going to watch something terrifying, but I believe that I did watch something terrifying. The scariest thing in the film wasn't a bunch of zombies trying to break in, or a big monster outside, but rather the humans, what they're capable of, and the negative power that imagination can have on us.", "In the near future, a plague is decimating society and Joel Edgerton is living with his family in a well protected house in an isolated rural area. They encounter a young family that needs help, and after some initial mistrust, Edgerton's family takes them into their home. Things seem good, but an incident leads to an atmosphere of fear and mistrust that erupts in violence. This is a very good, slow burning thriller that could have been a masterpiece of sorts if it didn't try to be a horror film too. Horror elements are introduced by a bunch of dreams that Edgerton's son has that are a fairly transparent mechanism for introducing false suspense scenes into a slow building narrative. It's apparent very early on that these are just dreams and have no bearing on the film's reality, so they really just serve as a distraction and a device for introducing empty-headed jump scares. I wasn't too annoyed by them, until the film pulled the old \"I have woken up from dream ... oh no! it's still just a dream!\" crap and then I was more than a little annoyed. After a really emotionally devastating climax, the film lands on a manifestly incoherent conclusion that maybe is supposed to be covered up by a possible dream sequence ... only it's not. It just doesn't make sense and sullies the ending of a really good flick.", "\"It Come At Night\"...WOW...I am truly in awe of how this film handles tension.

Coming out of it I was very satisfied with the payoff. This isn't the run of the mill horror movie or post-epidemic film we have seen time and time again. While it takes certain tropes from modern day horror movie, it puts a unique spin on them in a way that actually benefits itself rather than feeling like a needless studio note that only hinders the film's intensity like most do today. This movie goes against the norm with its storytelling and scares. The scares don't come from what is shown or even known, but what is unknown. What isn't seen is what supplies the frights.", "In order to go a little further I suppose I should give a brief synopsis of what this movie is about. Taking place some time after a form of disease has seemingly infected the world's population, we center on a family in the midst of the aftermath of whatever epidemic may have occurred as the reside in the middle of the forest alone. Alone at least until a strange family comes to live with them and they learn to work together in order to survive. From there I do not want to say much more if anyone plans to see this film.", "Again, I feel the need to reiterate that this is not a conventional horror film. If you are not a fan of a slow burn and ambiguity then this movie is not for your. Do not expect jump scares left and right or a quick pace to its plot. The writing takes its time and gives just enough throughout to make the viewer well aware that there are dangers, but from where is left open ended. It plays with the audience's perception a bit with what is really going on; whether certain people are lying or not, if someone is actually infected by this virus they're all afraid of, how this virus actually effects the person or persons that contract it.

If you're looking for a spooky good time at the movies, filled with jumps and scares and gooey monsters... you're gonna have a bad time. If you want a classic ghost story or a silent killer in the woods... you're not gonna get what you want.

Something that rattles you to the core and explores the concept of \"horror\" from an altogether different direction. Well, my friend... that's what you'll definitely get here. \"It Comes at Night\" is an incredibly tense and hard-hitting portrayal of the fragility of the human mind, and an intensely disturbing tale of how paranoia and fear can turn a person monstrous. It's a brutally simplistic and deceptively straight-forward tale that hardcore and open-minded horror fans will surely love. But be warned... this is not a film aimed at mainstream audiences. Much like other contemporary classics such as the aforementioned \"The Witch\", \"It Follows\" or the incredibly captivating \"The Babadook\"... this is not a movie that holds your hand, and your enjoyment of the film will come down to your willingness to let yourself be thoroughly absorbed by it, as you analyze the meanings of scenes and moments for hours after seeing it...", "The film is set sometime after a mysterious disease has began to spread.

Writer/director Shults proves to be a very capable and complex visual storyteller thanks to his nuanced and dark visuals and incredibly subtle writing. He doles out precisely what information in needed and nothing more in a wonderfully deliberate manner to help in the ever-growing build of tension, while also allowing his characters to gradually reveal their thoughts and personalities to the audience through action and reaction in a very stirring way. This is an incredibly well-structured work where each scene reveals a crucial piece to the overall puzzle of story and character, and it's aided by some absolutely mind-blowing and gorgeous uses of composition, lighting and movement with the camera. Just a masterful piece of work.", "The performances are a revelation. Much like in his own directorial effort \"The Gift\", Joel Edgerton excels in an wicked and sometimes heartfelt performance. He's quickly becoming one of my favorite modern actors and gives some of his best work here. I was also very taken with Kelvin Harrison Jr., whom portrays the character of Travis in a very sensitive but also unique way. In addition to feeling the same feeling of dread and fear as the rest of his family, Travis is also going through that strange period in any person's life where they are becoming an adult and starting to experience sexual urges and thoughts, and Harrison communicates this superbly, allowing it to aid in the growing sense of threat throughout the film. Though she sometimes feels underutilized, Carmen Ejogo has enough presence to ground the film, and she seems to be a sort-of anchor for the other characters to lean on in harder scenes. Special commendation also goes to Riley Keough and Christopher Abbott, who lend a great deal to the film and are both absolutely incredible.", "That all being said, I do have some minor- and I do mean \"minor\"- squabbles with the film that hold it just shy of perfection. A few scenes feel tacked on and superfluous in the grand scheme of things, and I do think they will be obvious for anyone who sees the film. A few attempts at genuine scares fall flat for relying on conventions such as the \"false jump.\" And I do think the film could have been tightened ever-so-slightly. A few shots here and there could have a few seconds trimmed from them, and the film would flow a bit better. But these are borderline nit-picks in an otherwise near-flawless work of horrific art. \"It Comes at Night\" is not a film that will appeal to many film-goers.

I won't even pick on the fact the film has been marketed as a horror when it's really just a think piece about values. Anyway, the story focuses on a family of three waiting out the fall of society when a second family joins them. And that's it. We do have a few plot points come up, the son has 'special feelings' for the newly arrived female and there is a little 'can we trust the others' but these issues are barely touched on and go nowhere. The final act is such a hysterical downer it feels like it was made deliberately shocking in attempt to justify the 60 minute wait it took to get to it.

The actors are all very good, especially the young man who plays the 17 year old son who is the focal point of the film. Good direction, music, and a nice pace as well. Other than a a couple of dream sequences and one jump scare jolt, THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE. I'm glad I saw it but would never want to see it again. I cannot imagine it has much rewatch value. It's all very well done, quite tightly paced and, once again, has interesting characters, mystery and good acting/direction. It is not a horror film or even a thriller.

I thought it was perfect as is. 7/10 but forgotten by me for now as I move into some real horror film territory.", "It Comes At Night is a perfect example of the modern day marketing machine doing a phenomenal job of misleading the customer in order to sell a product. If you haven't seen the trailer for this movie yet, do not watch it. The trailer was tremendously crafted as a straight up horror movie, but as you can see from much of the backlash from moviegoers, it's not really a horror movie. If you go into it with that assumption, you'll be furious when the credits roll. Consider it more of a paranoia suspense or thriller with some family drama mixed in and hopefully you'll be able to digest the film properly instead of shouting \"what the f*** was that s***?!\" like someone so eloquently exclaimed in the showing I attended.", "It Comes At Night is a psychological study of how we change when the circumstances around us change, and simultaneously, the potential loss of innocence that accompanies those dire situations.The closing shot, which many people hated but I really enjoyed, is a bleak and hopeless picture\u2014husband and wife, distance between them at an otherwise empty table and an empty house, sitting in silence. Not expressively sad, happy, or angry. Perhaps they await their almost certain fate from the unnamed disease. Perhaps they cannot cope with the loss of their child. Perhaps they are relieved to have eliminated the threats to their physical wellbeing. Like many questions in this morally ambiguous realm, the answer is muddled.", "Despite not being a \"horror\" movie, the film does an incredible job building and maintaining suspense, creating an atmosphere that's unsettling and uneasy for nearly its entire duration. Each slow dolly move towards a door increases anxiety and though we never get the big jump scares that normal moviegoers would expect, we're never left off the hook. It's like a chick that you're texting who claims that she always wants to meet up and each time you make plans, she cancels at the last minute. After the first ten botched dates, you think you'd know better. Nope. You keep asking her to get drinks and keep getting rejected.", "While I do like films that don't spell everything out, the script is so paper-thin that some details would've been nice to support the actions of the characters. Starting a film in media res can be a powerful storytelling tool if executed correctly, but here it feels like an excuse to not explain things. I wish we could've seen the family dynamic, even if just for one flashback, before the disease hit. It could've provided some extra depth and contrast to their present-day personalities because for all we know, they could have been paranoid, gun wielding people before the disease plagued the country. If their horrific actions are a result of their environment, seeing how they've changed since their environment changed would've been immensely beneficial. ", "Another bothersome technique that weighed down the movie was its reliance on Travis's dream sequences to either fill time, provide more tense moments, or to help with the horror style trailer. We get it\u0085Travis has nightmares. And rightfully so \u2014the kid just watched his damn grandfather being burned in a hand-dug grave. But those nightmares should motivate Travis to take action in some way. Otherwise, it just feels like a rinse and repeat.", "It Comes At Night is good. It's not great and it's not bad\u2014just good. The film deals with powerful contemplations about humanity's desire to survive by any means necessary, and what lengths humans will go to achieve survival. It's a microcosm of the isolationist mentality that seems to be plaguing our country under our current regime. Unfortunately, it's not a new story and this film does not offer any additionally valuable insight into that discussion. It's tense as hell, shot beautifully, and has a wonderful soundscape, but it also lacks depth, asks many questions and provides virtually no answers. I still don't know what the title means; I'm assuming it means Travis when he's dreaming of Kim in his bed.", "6.9/10", "I fell asleep twice while watching this movie. Nothing happens and I do not know how is the title even relevant to the movie. The kid in the movie was super annoying. I will not even watch it for free on NetFlix, it is this bad!", "Do yourself a favor and watch an episode of TWD instead.", "The story: Paul, his wife and their teenage son Travis are buried in a house at the bottom of the woods, while a pandemic is decimating humanity. One night, Will enters their home with the intention of finding drinking water for his companion and their son. Paul hesitantly decides to welcome them under his roof. Except that little by little, suspicions and paranoia settled.", "The brothel (in its true sense, is understood) is always very popular in horror and it is stirring with quite a lot of success on the screens in recent times.

In the good average. The hick, at any rate for the amateur of the genre, is that this feature, although anguished to wish and effectively carried out, does not really stand out from the point of view of the narrative - in spite of its touch \"zombiesque\" and its Suspicion of gore .", "On the other hand, it is beautiful (how to speak) to see how well the characters, well encamped in the first part of the film (there is the dream and the nightmare) remain faithful to themselves: their reactions , Even desperate, are always coherent with what is known about them.", "To interpret them, a fair distribution led by Joel Edgerton - who had appeared magnificently Machiavellian in The Gift (which he had also written and directed).", "And then there's the artistic \"family\" that Trey Edward Shults is already forming: his accomplices from Krisha to music and photography, Brian McOmber and Drew Daniels, are new adventures.", "The soundtrack of the first, which raises the tension up to the treble and which disappears when it is necessary in order to let silence fall on a scene like a screed of lead, is diabolically orchestrated. As for the second, he carves the shadows and touches of light; In doing so, it is paranoia.", "In short, the pleasure is there, big, as long as the film lasts. But the effect disappears unfortunately rather quickly. Unfourtunately.", "One, this is not a Horror movie as much as it is suspense. This movie, from the clips, looks very tense and horrific, but to be honest, the trailer clips are the most suspenseful parts. This movie is something that our group of 15 went together to see but walked away confused more than ever. This movie offered so much less than we had hoped for and made us question everything. On the way home, we continued to look up reasoning of what the movie was supposed to mean and how to interpret it because we were left unsatisfied and unimpressed to be completely honest. Please do not waste your time in theaters and just wait until it arrives in your home theater.", "This is the first \"horror\" movie I have fallen asleep in.

But, the movie ended and we all wished we had spent our money more wisely."]},

They live in the woods in seclusion but that seclusion is broken by a man getting into their house. This new man is taken prisoner and explains to Paul (the main guy) that he is only trying to get food and water for his family. Paul agrees to help the man and they go off to get the new family. There are some other things that happen but are honestly not important. The new family arrives and all is well. Paul's son continues to have nightmares (premonitions?) about various things: his dead grandpa, the virus etc. The son's dog randomly runs off barking into the woods one day and the son chases him. There is an implied presence that the dog finds that seems to be right up over the hill everyone is standing near but nothing is shown. Kind of like this whole movie. The dog returns only to have major damage done to him by something and he is apparently sick also. The dog is put down and paranoia sets it. Soon after a \"nightmare\" the young child of the new family is thought to be sick and so the two families stay apart for a day. The next day Paul's son says he thinks the young boy might be sick. So Paul and his wife go to check on the other family and a tense standoff happens. Outside Paul and the other man fight over a gun and Paul's wife ends up shooting the other man. The other mother runs off with the young boy and Paul thinks this is a good time to murder them both, which he does. After this it's shown that Paul's son is infected and I guess he dies (it's not clear) and the end of the movie shows Paul and his wife staring at each other across the table, possibly sick themselves. ", "So what comes at night?? Nothing. Nothing does. This movie could have used the tension so much better than it did. Also there is implied heavily that there is some creature or something outside the house but it's never shown or resolved in any way. What a huge disappointment this movie was. Never should have been made.", "High IMDb ratings officially mean less than sh*t. This is not a horror/mystery. In fact, it's a mystery why this is being marketed as a horror. ", "Nothing comes in this movie - day or night. You spend the whole movie waiting for the dread reveal that's teased throughout the trailer and wind up with...nothing. All the supernatural/evil stuff you see in the trailer is just cheap, jump scare \"dreams\" the kid is having and nothing related to the main plot at all. And they blow their whole load by revealing all the scares in the trailer itself, so they have no impact when you're watching the movie. I expected much better from Edgerton, but I don't think even he was making the same movie that was advertised. I think the title and trailer of the movie are a complete misrepresentation, and it would be better renamed and promoted as \"Paranoid hillbillies living in a cabin\".", "I can appreciate why some are upset that it is not some traditional rampaging monster that 'comes at night' but this is one hell of a focused and horrific movie. And the real horror is the extent of distrust in others and it is very apt that at this moment in the world where everything suddenly seems a little uncertain that we should be thrown into this dark little number. The photography is spot on, the sombre score from Brian McOmber just right and, of course, it is the script that really wins the day. The performances are all good but if the script is right it is hard for competent actors to go far wrong. Kelvin Harrison Jr is a new name on me but he does a wonderfully convincing job in what for me is the crucial and most difficult central role. He grows within his performance from boy child to crucial adult and in the sweetest section of the film, in the middle, he is visibly charmed by the affection and playfulness he spies on the newcomers. Not as much 'action' as some might have liked but I was totally captivated at the start and as someone else has said, by eyes never left the screen till the end. Completely involving and disturbing and many have referred to this as post-apocalyptic which is not quite right because whatever it is that is happening - still is.", "plain and simple don't watch this movie. don't rent it from Redbox or watch on Netflix, its a super waste of time. there is no suspense, there is no explanation as to why this movie even exists. there is no IT that come at night! if you've read this review then u know that its true. IT never COMES at NIGHT! A-24 does great with there commercials to draw u in. their movies are crap.(I turned on my laptop just to make this review this movie doesn't even deserve 1 star)", "Really and honestly this is not a film worth watching. It basically revolves around 3 or 4 significant events that sit on a bed of bland uninteresting dialogue. The acting is strong, but not strong enough to save it. There's no \"horror\" other than dreadfully worthless ending that leaves you feeling someone has stolen over an hour of your time.", "i love Joel Edgerton, i cannot believe that he gave hand to cheating people as this disgusting movie does. it is not a bad drama, but all the inserted \"horror\" like flicks are not part of the film and are disgusting, forcing you to be terrified of nothing. terrible terrible waste of time.", "It's misleading to have named this film It Comes At Night when \"It\" can come at any given time of the day. There was no specificity to nighttime. The danger wasn't more imminent at night because nothing happened at night...nothing...no really nothing. This film should've been called \"It Comes\" or better yet this film should not have been made in the first place. There's no true story line and it definitely was not scary, eerie or creepy which is why it's also inaptly categorized. Not only did nothing come at night but definitely nothing scary came at night or at all for that matter. What a let down.", "As a movie buff I try to stay optimistic and open about every movie as ratings/reviews can be misleading.For example movies like Get Out, It Follows and Moonlight got amazing reviews (based on originality but in hindsight these movies were dreadful). It Comes At Night from the trailers looked very promising. Although the movie didn't turn out to be a classic horror the originality of the storyline was appreciated.So many movies with great plots/story lines where the director/producers didn't make the most of it have been created and this movie can be added to the list. Could have been so much better.", "I went into this movie with no expectations or standards. All I wanted to see was a generic horror movie. But to my dismay... I was wrong.", "It Comes at Night is atmospheric and tense in almost every single possible way. The cinematography is tense, the character interactions are tense and the score is atmospheric. This movie NAILS the essence of horror: tension, which is almost never broken.", "==== SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT ====", "If you wanted to see a good old \"oh no there's a monster, right there\" then you'll be disappointed. The movie has no monsters, unlike what the trailers show. Do not go into this movie with expectations, or else you'll be disappointed.", "Plot: The story essentially takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, where the mankind or at least most of it has been killed off by a mysterious disease. A family living in the middle of a forest are held under strict conditions, which are upheld by the father, Paul. One day though... A family pleads to get inside.", "What I like about the plot, is that there is little to no exposition. Most people hate it, when everything is delivered to you through dialogue, which could've been used to something much better. The director and screenwriter Trey Edward Shults made fantastic job on keeping the audience under mystery. What is the disease? What does it do? Where are all the people? Where is this cabin? It might also annoy, that not everything is explained, but few small nuggets of info let us know, that the things are as the characters say they are. This also allows us to choose, whether to believe the characters or not, which creates suspense in an already tense situation.", "Acting: For a indie movie, I was surprised that this movie had some talented people working on it. Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbott, Carmen Ejogo... Their reactions and behaviors in this movie are pretty close to what people would usually do under this circumstances. Kelvin Harrison Jr. also made a stunning performance, as a teenager, who has been introduced into the brutal and cold world. ", "Cinematography: I'll keep it short. Long, static, or creeping shots make some of the scenes anxious to watch. Especially during the woods, where you can expect anything. What Edward also succeeds at, is to decide what to show, and what to leave for the audience's imagination. This is probably my favorite thing about this movie. Not showing enough is what keeps our imagination running, and Shults nailed it.", "Score: It would be a crime to say, that the music has no relation to the movie whatsoever. During tense scenes, the score starts to creep up... slowly towards an unknown crescendo, that keeps you biting your nails. While using rapid sounds to create anxiety fueling nerve racks to keep you in your seat. Although, I think some scenes could've been better without an music, but that's is minor nitpicking. The score is amazing.", "Horror: I'm usually a easy-to-scare individual, and I hate jump-scares. One thing that keeps me from watching horror movies, is the annoying use of subtle noise and scary face to create horror. Edward knows that is played out and... well uses tension to create suspenseful moments of dread and terror. I was taped to my seat especially during the scenes, where Travis walks around the house during the dark. The surrounding darkness around his lantern creates paranoia, that something might lurk in the shadows... when there isn't. There is though ONE minor jump-scare, but it is built up so well, that it actually is a well deserved jump-scare.", "Ending: Not a lot of movies tend to shock or amuse you with it's climax, but It Comes at Night jabs you straight in the gut, during the last 20 minutes of the movie or so. When the credits rolled, I was frozen. I literally was shocked, at how well Edward managed to mess my head. This same thing happened during the screening of Logan, where it left a two week-depression feel. Here... Damn. I just... ", "Overall: It Comes at Night is one of those movies, that like the 1982 The Thing will become panned for what it isn't, but loved by what it tries to tell. As the first horror movie I've ever witnessed, it sure left me good impressions about the genre. There may be cheap, cash in horror movies in the rough, but there certainly are some diamonds too. I adore this movie, and it gives me more ideas and inspiration. I rate it 9/10. Amazing.", "There are not many special effects or means to create these, except the guns. There is a painting by Bruguel, whose paintings appear as a reflection of human condition in films by other directors (say, Solaris). We see Paul's family reading books. That hints that there is a reflective sub-tone of the movie.", "Travis acts as a catalyst since his spontaneous reactions often are followed by more misfortune.He does not have the down to earth mind of his father. Travis is a teenager who builds up fear and frustration. These reappear through his drawings or dreams. The dreams become more and more elaborate. Here the director appeals to a trick, which becomes a theme. He tricks us into believing his dreams are real and the horror fodder that we are used with (such as the scene where Kim spurts blood out of mouth). This deceptive method reminds me of Haneke. In this sense I found the final interesting, since it still could be partially Travis's dream. And here comes the other, encompassing deception: not only dreams are deceiving, but what is suggested as reality might be an appearance. Who really was the \"sick\" one? What really happened on the night when the red door was opened? And of course, what happened at the end? Alternative scenarios could be construed and we are not given the answers that we might crave for. Interesting indeed.", "I can't say I was much thrilled (maybe because of seeing too many movies recently) and felt like the movie lacks some salt and pepper, despite the good intentions. Thing is the more you think about the movie, the scarier it becomes. Perhaps what comes at night is some basal, primitive, terror. The naturalistic, simple scenery in which the action takes place suggests that. There are some plot points that might be discussed (they put off and on gas masks or wash their hands, usually sloppily, to fend off some unknown pathogen-a kind of blind protection; why did they accept strangers when they distrusted them so much?; and so on).", "I saw \"It Comes At Night\", starring Joel Edgerton-The Gift, Exodus:Gods and Kings; Carmen Ejogo-Alien:Covenant, Alex Cross; Kelvin Harrison Jr.- The Birth of a Nation, 12 Years a Slave; Christopher Abbott-Girls_tv, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and Riley Keough-Mad Max:Fury Road, Magic Mike, Oh yeah, she is the daughter of Lisa Marie Presley, which makes her the grandchild of Elvis.", "This is a weird little horror movie about people trying to survive after a mysterious disease strikes-you can tell when someone has the disease because they break out in boils and spit up blood. Joel, Carmen and their 17 year old son Kelvin live in a house out in the woods, secluded from most other people. The beginning of the movie shows Joel and Kelvin disposing of a family member that has already succumbed to the disease. They wear gas masks and gloves for protection. Infected bodies are burned and then buried, information you might need, in case you are ever in this type of situation. Then, Christopher shows up, wanting some shelter and food. He says he has a wife, Riley, and a child that are waiting just up the road a piece. Should Joel take them in? Of course not. But that's what happens and everybody gets anxious and suspicious and nobody trusts anyone and tempers flair. It's not a bad movie but you can tell it's low budget; they don't go into much detail about several things, such as the cause of the disease. Or why Kelvin has such weird dreams of having the disease, his grandpa coming back to visit him, or Riley coming into his room for a late night visit-Well, that last one is probably because he is a 17 year old teenager. It's rated \"R\" for violence, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental."]},

It adds an intrigue and is testament to the quality of the screenplay that there is no awkward expositional discussion about it. I think the pacing is good up to a point and the jump-scares are used sparingly and effectively. I think this movie comes apart in two places, which both feel as though they move too fast. The first is the introduction of the second family - this is too sudden. there is a real tension building on the way to get Will's wife and child with the 'is he / isn't he?' suspicion around the guys they meet in the woods and whether Paul can trust him. I feel like the abrupt cut back to the house and the family arriving gives a hard resolution to what could have been a sustained mystery. The second is the ending. We've seen it all before - the infection is in, and the infected must die. Again, no issues with this series of events, I've seen it a thousand times and it can rouse some emotional weight if the audience care about the characters. The trouble here is we don't. The bleak, stark isolation of the movie which has so wonderfully set the tone throughout becomes its own undoing. All of this is happening in a bubble, and we as the audience have only seen anything from within the bubble and so we are invested in making sure it doesn't burst. Paul has to kill Will and his family to preserve this and we are fine with that because we never got to see anything from their perspective. What becomes of Travis is the kicker, but there is a lack of real purpose to his character throughout which undermines this death. In the end you find yourself looking back at a series of half-explored plot lines (what did the dog chase? how is the infection spread? who opened the door at the end? were Travis' dreams relevant or foreboding, or were they just nightmares because they live in a post-apocalyptic hell where he recently had to destroy his mutant grandfather and he would have still had the same dreams if he lived to be 90?)

Went to see it at the cinema and after the movie everyone looked around and thought: 'Look at all these people who have just wen trough this movie without actually leaving the room'. I've lost my time, don't waste yours ;-)", "This film was badly written and should have been a stage play, the film had good production value with good acting, the movies continues environment of suspense with continued anti climatic continuity was exhausting and the movie was so bad the few people in the theater with me were vocally upset. A movie similar in theme (tho not stressing family as it come at night did) was 10 Cloverfield Lane, the same basic theme via the science fiction route and fantastically better written!", "This movie had loads of potential. The first 20 minutes were really promising and then it drops off into uninteresting monotony with a few interesting moments. It's like no director or writer bothers to finish a movie anymore. Instead of ANYTHING RESEMBLING CLOSURE or even just ONE SLIGHT HINT AT ANY SUBSTANCE, Hollywood just ends movies completely unfulfilled and abruptly.. and then chalks it up to \"art\". ", "The plot to this movie is actually really interesting. Joel Edgerton is great. The atmosphere is quite terrific in terms of horror. And then... nothing. This movie was completely anti-climactic and so many questions from minor to earth-shattering are left unanswered and DELIBERATELY unexplored. Screw this. What a waste of potential.", "This movie is one of the most boring pictures I've watched, no story line, no nothing, nothing at this movie makes any sense. Hated it... The acting is kinda good, but can't appreciate enough with such a bad story and slow story telling. It never catches your attention, I almost fell asleep two times, the final minutes were the best, but the ending made everything even worse.", "The immediate question I had to ask myself after watching It Comes at Night was, \"What did I really see?\" Certainly there are horrific images and dangers beyond the superficial; but the true fear didn't come from tangible figures, it was evoked from filmmaking that makes the fear personal to each viewer. Whether you are predicting monsters lingering out of frame, or feeling feverish on behalf of the characters, this film has the guts to require the audience to engage. ", "Earlier this year I was pleasantly surprised by the sequel to Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane. Rather than expanding the story to global catastrophe, we entered a very intimate setting with only 3 characters. In that film we knew what waited outside the bunker, making it an emotional game of duality, prison or sanctuary? Somehow, It Comes at Night accomplishes something very similar, without a prequel to add any suggestion as to where the terror is derived. In a remote woodland, in a boarded-up two-story cabin, we again have three characters that have secluded themselves from an unnamed horror. Paul, Travis, and Sarah don't go out at night; they wear gas masks at the slightest foreign element; and seem prepared for anything. Paul (Joel Edgerton) is a hardened man, shouldering the desperation so that his wife and son can live rather than just survive. His son, Travis, is in his late teens and has just buried his grandfather. The grandfather's death, from an unspecific disease, is both a red herring and catalyst for what we begin to understand is an isolated life amidst an apocalypse.", "The nature of the threat, beyond a sickness, is maddeningly hinted at. Can we expect zombies? Might there be mutant animals in the hills? The ambiguity of the threat could easily become a cheap plot device, if indeed the movie were about the threat. The real story begins when a second family ends up on Paul's doorstep. They are a mirror to Paul's family; a husband, Will; wife, Kim; and child, Andrew. Will's family is younger, and in greater need. Paul sees it as a duty to save those who can be, but makes it clear that his obligations go no farther than that.", "Social graces work juxtaposed to desperate measures so that politeness is relegated to curt respect. Nothing is free in this environment so harsh rules are accepted without question, and hard work is an expectation. Andrew is only 4 years old and Travis becomes the bridge between this young family and his stern father, breaking protocol for the sake of harmony. The protocol of safety is broken down on the first day. Gas masks are to be worn under strict conditions; the only entrance to the home is under Paul's control, and trust is a privilege that will ride on a razor's edge.", "The performance that carries this movie is from Travis, Kelvin Harrison Jr. He is the \"us\" in the movie and expresses every human emotion the setting deprives from others. Travis is a teenager almost non- existent in horror films. He loves, fears, but never shows that he is trying to prove himself. His character in almost any other suspense thriller would be gunning to live up to his father's expectations, and add to the divide between the two families. We find from his mourning over his grandfather, and horrible nightmares of suffering the same fate, that he is a child appropriately acting his age. He lusts after Kim, but doesn't create untoward drama. He dotes on the young Andrew, and respects Will. We feel his misery as he watches the humanity in his home unravel.", "Always in the margins of each scene is the implied horror. I found my speculation for what it might be waning steadily to the film's conclusion. Some might find the ending cheap, or anti-climactic. I can't imagine it ending any other way. The final moments are a subtle reveal that make the earlier climax all the more heart wrenching. If you feel that you missed something when the credits start rolling, you were looking for the wrong monster.", "The spoiler is, there is nothing to spoil. This film is dire, absolutely dreadful. If you thought the trailer looked interesting, or 'artsy' then watch it again, and again, until you have watched it for the one and a half hours of the film. You will have seen an equivalent amount of plot, and 50 times the horror.", "\"It Comes at Night\" focuses on a family hiding out in a remote cabin home in the aftermath of an apparent viral outbreak that has been eradicating civilization. One night, a man attempts to break into their home. They decide to let him, his wife, and young son stay, but to their own peril.", "In the vein of many post-apocalyptic horror films, \"It Comes at Night\" takes a simple and familiar premise and executes it with a considerable amount of grace. The plot is almost skeletal, but writer-director Trey Shults does a solid job at creating a pervasive sense of isolation and abandon that is quietly haunting\u2014at times the film almost felt to me like an ode to Ingmar Bergman's \"The Virgin Spring\" set in a post-millennial end-of-times. ", "For a horror film rooted in a post-apocalyptic landscape, the film is remarkably quiet and the action is few and far between, but even in its focus on the minutia of pastoral life and the dynamics between two groups of strangers, the film is never dull. This is partly due to solid pacing, and largely due to standout performances from the entire cast. All are believable and the scenarios and the way they are played out ring true. I will admit that I found the conclusion to be a letdown, not necessarily on the grounds of ambiguity, but more in that the otherwise stellar pacing was throttled by an ending that felt uninspired, no matter how truthfully it may ring. That said, it's a forgivable shortcoming in my eyes as the majority of the film was legitimately engrossing.", "Overall, \"It Comes at Night\" is a solid horror film that is maybe more of a dreadful meditation on survival and human behavior in extenuating circumstances than anything else that neatly fits within genre parameters. Truly commendable performances from Edgerton, Abbott, Ejogo, Harrison Jr., and Keough are reason enough to give the film a go in my eyes. If you like your viral apocalypse with a heavy dose of mood, this is a worthwhile watch in spite of its pyrrhic conclusion. 7/10.", "Summary (no spoilers) ", "A family who are secure within a desolate home as an unnatural threat terrorizes the world, a man has made a strict domestic order with his wife and son that's when a desperate young family arrives seeking refuge.", "My Review (no spoilers)", "The plot was simple and sweet it still had a lot of horror and mystery moments nothing dragged and with a perfect conclusion. All the actors did their given parts well. This movie showed us that we don't need zombies or ghosts to bring out the horror and mystery in a movie but it can be done with the help of a good script and some good directing and acting. Overall a movie to watch.", "My Recommendation", "Yes I would recommend this movie to everyone.", "My Rating", "8/10", "The movie is well shot and acted, but I never found myself caring for the characters' safety. It seemed like they were going for more realistic characters, but I just found that boring. And no, that one awkward conversation about bread pudding and pies didn't quite win me over.", "Also, I'm fine with the fact that the titular 'it' is a subversion of expectations and that it's probably about how the fear that comes at night makes us do terrible or stupid things... but what kind of hackneyed plot is that? Sorry movie, but six+ seasons of The Walking Dead beat you to the punch on that one. Not to mention it's been done a million times before that. Part of me is kind of glad that a terrible looking cgi monster didn't show up at the end to go \"a- bloogy-woogy-woo\" and cough on everyone, but just being left with a tired moral and having everyone die at the end did not help this movie endear to me.", "Personally, I found \"10 Cloverfield Lane\" more engrossing (notwithstanding the ending). Probably because that movie was centered around an interesting character driven by an amazing performance that constantly kept you engaged and wondering what was really going on.", "Well anyway, it is just a movie after all. Thanks for reading and have a good one.", "i gave this move a rate of 2 out of 10. and i have been so generous. those 2 points is for acting. because i liked the acting in the movie and that was pretty much the only thing i liked about this movie. i'm really sorry to call it a movie. it don't have a story. and i'm not exaggerating there is no story. i wasted an hour and half of my life trying to know whats comes at night. and i didn't know what the heck comes at night. i don't think even the writer or the director even knew what does. please make your self a favor and do something else . don't waste your time watching this poring movie. u might use the time starring at the your roof or sleep. it will be better than watching this thing.", "'It Comes at Night' doesn't rely on cheap thrills or jump scares to get you spooked. Here's a (rare) horror film, that uses Atmosphere & FEAR itself to give you the chills.

Then a desperate young family arrives seeking refuge.", "'It Comes at Night' has a strong first-hour, where the tension & the spookiness kept me engaged. BUT, sadly, the second-hour is sluggish & the narrative doesn't go beyond its promising premise. While the atmosphere & the treatment remain suitably grim & eerie, the goings-on are loose & repetitive after a point. Even the climax, is a tad predictable. In short, 'It Comes at Night' has a chilling first-hour, but a disappointing second!", "Trey Edward Shults's Screenplay begins strongly, but doesn't go beyond its premise. How I wish the Writing as interesting as the entire set-up. Shults's Direction is excellent. He creates a bleak world of fear & fright, with a remarkable vision. He deserves brownie points for daring to make a Horror film, that doesn't follow the genre clich\u00e9s. Cinematography is claustrophobic, but effective. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are well-done. Brian McOmber's Score is chilling.", "Performance-Wise: Joel Edgerton is competent, yet again. His portrayal of a family man, ready to do anything for his folks, is compelling. Christopher Abbott is natural to the core, as the other man, who'd do anything to protect his family. Carmen Ejogo, Kelvin Harrison Jr. & Riley Keough leave a mark. ", "On the whole, 'It Comes at Night' is far from perfect, but its impossible to ignore as well.", "This has turned out to be a really good year for films so far. There's been a spate of quality films that I've seen that really give you hope for the future of films. This is one I'd add to that list, a cool and hard edged suspenseful movie.", "What we have is another in the survival horror movie sphere, but this isn't really derivative, and if anything is original and intriguing. We have a family having locked themselves away to protect themselves from some unnamed contagious disease, and through fate end up inviting another family in with them to support each other. However, paranoia understandably prevails and inevitably leads to some confrontations.", "Joel Edgerton is turning into a mighty fine actor, and as the lead man in the film, acting as the head of the family, he gives a tense and unnerving performance that is just perfect here. The whole crew, none of the rest I can recall having seen before, are excellent. It's like a high-end stage play on film, and it works.", "The film is well filmed, it has the odd jump, but it's about the people not about the horrors far off. The people have to fear those around them not way off. In some ways, it kind of reminds me of 'The Road' but also the original 'Night of the Living Dead' movie. They both blend well together here.", "I'd recommend this highly. Tough viewing at times, but a good shot in the arm for horror films.", "fear of the unknown, what haunts us the most? not knowing, not understanding. The directer nailed this. I left the cinema feeling dazed, not sure really how to feel.. this was his purpose. Everyday people, a realistic situation, the demons, the paranoia. These are all natural feelings we would feel as humans. We fear what we don't know or understand, we don't know whats going on around us, we didn't know who was good or evil. The film was superb. Those who feel otherwise simply do not understand the point of the movie. amazing!"]},

There is a survival sense as well which makes you think how you would act if you were in the same situation as the characters. It gets extremely intense and I was very immersed many times watching it.

We then go on to find out later in the film in a conversation with Will's wife that Travis cannot remember how long he's been having issues with sleep, a clear indication of the sheer confusion of reality and fantasy caused by his insomnia, being driven mad by fear and paranoia. The aspect ratio is, what we seem to perceive, as a clear indication of a dream sequence. However, going by the aspect ratio (and music) being used in the final, very much real scene in which Will and his family try to escape, an overlap occurs. Perhaps a symbolic indication of Travis' nightmares being embodied in the now reality, or perhaps evidence of the constant confusion of what is dream and what is reality? What I am really trying to say is we cannot trust Travis' perception, what may be a dream, may in fact be a reality and vice versa."},
{"ratings": 1, "review_text": "The Door - Okay this leads me on to the big scene, the central focus of many theories. It is made clear upon the arrival of Will's family that the only way in and out of the house is via the keys that remain in Paul/Sarah's possession. It appears that they are on Paul's nightstand at this point. It seems odd that Andrew could get the keys and in fact reach the locks on both doors and exit the house entirely, thus, letting in Stanley, and subsequently get the illness. What seems more probable is that the dream sequence in which Travis leaves the house to find the dog, was, in some respect real. He got the keys from his parents, took the lantern to find the dog and brought/left the door open for the dog to return (Paul noted that Stanley knew his way home). I cannot pin point a reasoning behind Andrew being in the other room, a mere coincidence? However, I believe that it was not Andrew who was actually sick, but Travis, having perhaps made contact with Stanley, or whatever is capable of spreading the illness."},

I do appreciate that this is more of a take on the reaction of people for survival, how maddening fear can be of an unknown enemy, especially one that you cannot see, such as a disease. I do appreciate that this is not your ordinary jump-scare horror movie, but rather a survival-suspenseful-family-protecting-doing-anything-for-them kind of thriller. BUT IT WAS AWFUL.", "I like you Joel Edgerton. Hence the 3 stars. But you gotta make it up for me dude. Not cool.", "This film is incredibly understated, however, undermined by an array of misleading marketing and conventional trailers. To those of you who were expecting a simplistic horror movie filled with gore and post-apocalyptic madness, you will be disappointed. This movie is a mind-bender. I have seen so many crazy theories and explanations to this movie, and I have my own.", "*SPOILERS AND THEORIES BELOW*", "I will try to cover as much as I can, but this is what I thought.", "Travis - It is clear from the opening sequence in which the Grandfather dies that Travis doesn't handle things well emotionally, expressed by his mothers concern for him having witnessed the death. We then go on to find out later in the film in a conversation with Will's wife that Travis cannot remember how long he's been having issues with sleep, a clear indication of the sheer confusion of reality and fantasy caused by his insomnia, being driven mad by fear and paranoia. The aspect ratio is, what we seem to perceive, as a clear indication of a dream sequence. However, going by the aspect ratio (and music) being used in the final, very much real scene in which Will and his family try to escape, an overlap occurs. Perhaps a symbolic indication of Travis' nightmares being embodied in the now reality, or perhaps evidence of the constant confusion of what is dream and what is reality? What I am really trying to say is we cannot trust Travis' perception, what may be a dream, may in fact be a reality and vice versa.", "The Door - Okay this leads me on to the big scene, the central focus of many theories. It is made clear upon the arrival of Will's family that the only way in and out of the house is via the keys that remain in Paul/Sarah's possession. It appears that they are on Paul's nightstand at this point. It seems odd that Andrew could get the keys and in fact reach the locks on both doors and exit the house entirely, thus, letting in Stanley, and subsequently get the illness. What seems more probable is that the dream sequence in which Travis leaves the house to find the dog, was, in some respect real. He got the keys from his parents, took the lantern to find the dog and brought/left the door open for the dog to return (Paul noted that Stanley knew his way home). I cannot pin point a reasoning behind Andrew being in the other room, a mere coincidence? However, I believe that it was not Andrew who was actually sick, but Travis, having perhaps made contact with Stanley, or whatever is capable of spreading the illness.", "The Monster - Another big question, what is 'it'? Is there a monster out in the woods? what was the dog barking at? Now I noticed another comment referencing the 'monsters' that Travis was drawing. Indeed they are monster-like, however, the faces, in my opinion, look awfully like gas masks. Perhaps there were other people in the woods, enticing Stanley to bark at them. Another group maybe? We know there were 2 men within a short distance of the house. And in Travis' dream like state, it is likely he would have seen them on his travels. I also think these 2 men were the reasoning behind Will having his own gun, we know Paul was shot at, however Will said the men had nothing in their possession. ", "Overall - I think in the final sequence, Travis and his family were in fact infected. The way in which Travis 'walked' out the red door symbolises his death, notice the marks were not on his skin anymore. This could indicate perhaps entering into the unknown, facing his fears or dying. Whatever you perceive the door to represent. I think the disease itself manifests within the water, with 'dirty' being written on the water container and Will and his family didn't choose to simply go to a local lake. They relied on the water purification system. The painting is also a clear focal point, it seems to me that the painting is the best representation we have of what is happening beyond the door. The ending is very bleak, sad and realistic. The protagonists focused too much on routine, trust and not enough on the reality of the situation.", "Maybe it's not that wow. But the script is very good quality. Camera and filming are on a good level. Something to watch years later for sure. The script takes all the attention and you don't even notice actors which are good as well. Very easy to watch at that very slow developing pace. Very nice done background music. It's 5.8 +1 for the script + filming and +1 for the easiness that all of the works bring to the movie.", "This is a terrifically made atmospheric horror that racks up the tension. The first half hour or so was a claustrophobic paranoid induced nightmare of atmosphere. The camera never stood still, the music was continuous and spine tinglingly good. I was thinking at this point that we had a masterpiece of the genre on our hands, hoping upon all hope the film could keep it up. The second half goes for an even more languid change of pace (that stops in time before it becomes laborious), and turns into a physiological drama that is emotionally driven that always keeps the fear in your mind, reminding us that what goes unseen is scarier than what is shown.", "The least said about the plot the better, although everything in the film is left a bit ambiguous it does not feed you explanations and at times here you wish you had a little bit but it's up to you for conclusions.", "It comes at night has certainly been mismarketed and will undoubtedly hurt audience reactions. If you come to this looking for the next conjuring you'll be sorely disappointed. This is a smart bit of paranoia cinema that takes its time (sometimes a bit too much) but was an excellent viewing experience.", "As a production company, A24 has made an almighty splash in Hollywood with powerful independent films, Moonlight, Room and Ex Machina just being a few of the many major successes they've had. Showing faith in an array of filmmakers and their visions has paid dividends so far, and it continues to do so with Trey Edward Shults and his psychological horror It Comes At Night. ", "In a post apocalyptic world ravaged by an unknown threat, Paul (Joel Edgerton), his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), and their teenage son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) have secluded themselves in a cabin in the woods. When a young family arrives seeking refuge, their way of life is put to the test.", "Horror has seen somewhat of a revival in the past few years with new and exciting filmmakers making it clear that the genre can be so effective when you opt for more than just jump scares and loud noises to scare your audience. It Comes At Night takes place within a cabin and a section of the surrounding woodland and Shults utilises natural lighting and silence incredibly well to create an unnerving experience in such a confined space.", "This is a well crafted film with some beautiful cinematography from Drew Daniels and a brooding score from Brian McOmber, both accentuating the mystery of the film's narrative. Shults makes It Comes At Night a film where nothing is spoon fed to the audience, instead leaving it for them to make up their own minds, right up until its powerful final moments.", "Coming to the performances, It Comes At Night is driven forward by the feeling of paranoia that grips the characters and the cast are all on fine form here. We know the qualities that Joel Edgerton can bring to a film and he certainly delivers again here. It's Kelvin Harrison Jr. who I was impressed with the most as the film progressed, his sense of fear and uncertainty really showing through his facial expressions.", "My advice would be to leave any expectations you have at the door and just watch it unfold because this film took me by surprise. If you're looking for mystery in your film this week, look no further than It Comes At Night.", "Most people have found the movie \"It comes at night\" disappointing because of its trailer that makes you believe that the movie will be about something different. I was lucky enough to have a friend tell me that the movie was mis-marketed, so I walked into the film without any expectations and thus, I was able to appreciate the film in a way I would not have been able to if I was expecting something.", "It comes at night has become my favourite movie of the summer. Trey Edward Shults has a bright future ahead of him. I was completely fascinated by this movie and loved almost every second of it.", "Let me talk about the cinematography, because its great. The camera moves in such a beautiful way and the shots are perfect. Also, the camera creates a lot of tension in some very good scenes.", "The color grading is great. The whole movie is pretty dark which makes you feel vulnerable to what lurks in the shadows. Some people might be bothered by that, but I loved it. talking about darkness, the lighting was amazing and looked really natural.", "The performances are pretty great, and almost all of the characters were very good. I say almost because I believe that the two female characters sometimes didn't have anything to do, but that is just a nitpick.", "This movie puts you in the point of view of the characters, which I loved. You don't know what is going on in the the movie and it doesn't give you the answers. I loved that this movie was brave enough to not give you the answers and actually lets you wonder.", "The themes that this movie explores are great. It explores how paranoia can get into someone's head and mess with him, and this creates a lot of great scenes full of tension.", "The movie also has a lot of dream sequences, which were important to the story, but I believe could have been handled a little better, again, its just a nitpick.", "And finally, another small problem I have with the film is again, concerning the ambiguities or \"plot-holes\". They aren't really plot-holes, they are just things that are never explained. The director says that the answers exist in his head, and I believe him. I just think that it would be a lot better if he could have left some puzzle pieces here and there so that someone smart enough can figure it out, just like with \"Enemy\".", "In conclusion, I loved this movie. Is it perfect? No, but I believe that it is a very good movie that every horror fan should watch. Also, if you are not the kind of person that enjoys slow-moving movies, you will hate this one, because it is slow.", "Went to the movie thinking, based on the trailer, that this would be a horror/scary movie. Spent the first hour waiting for the climax, for the horror to start, for anything interesting to happen, and the last 30 minutes wondering what the point of the movie was.", "The movie is very slow. I guess the idea is to leave you wondering or for you to fill in the blanks (what happened? why are people getting sick? what's out there?), but instead it disappoints. I can not recommend it. The acting is decent, but the story is weak, at best.", "The characters in this movie do not act as people act. It seems like it's leaving clues to an underlying mystery, but not one of them pans out. There is no mystery. The title is meaningless. Nothing happens. If it were realistic, it could be a psychological thriller. It could have been a horror movie. It could have been a pandemic movie. But it is just a half-assed it's-the-end-of-the-world-so-everyone-becomes-paranoid-and-kills-each-other-at-the-drop-of-a-hat movie. Boring. Stupid. Truly awful.", "I had a bad feeling at the start just because the lead actor was in Warrior, another truly awful movie. If I ever see that guy with a leading role in a flick again, I'm immediately turning it off.", "Originally saw in the theater and only seen once since then; I remember clenching my hand so to me the horror is very effective even if it's mysterious! Trey Edward Shultz created such a great deeply disturbing experience, I even remember seeing the trailer years back even then I was so excited. I love the way it was filmed with amazing dialogue! The atmospheric tone is soothing to me! Riley Keogh is lovely I wish I could hangout with her, same with Joel Edgerton he's great I love his performance.", "Pointles I hate the trend that survival based movies are taking, the you can't trust anyone so just kill them trend. What is that teaching, and instilling in people's minds for when the S really hits the fan. In an already selfish, me first society, things like this only makes things worse, furthering the me first attitudes The world needs unity.", "This movie is garbage, so unoriginal, and just a lazy cookie cutter overdone plot that is used way to much. Wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this crap.", "They saved a bunch of money on Fx and makeup because it didn't come at night or at all.", "Warning! If you go into this expecting a creature feature, you'll be vastly disappointed! It's more of a psychological thriller then a straight up horror film.", "\"It Comes at Night\" should really be renamed to something like, \"The Sickness\".", "I was hoping for some kind of creature feature, which this movie is not. A huge failing of the title is the massive misdirection. Just to be clear, this is not a monster movie and nothing comes at night.", "For the most part, I enjoyed this movie, although a large part of me kept wondering when the spooky monsters would appear. The film does a great job of building, and sustaining, tension. Atmosphere and setting are good. Acting is competent. Cinematography, lighting, etc. are all nicely done. Even the pacing is good.", "The story revolves around a mysterious \"sickness\" that has presumably crippled civilization and we are introduced to a small cast of characters struggling to survive the epidemic. That's about it. This could have been a great film, but it's just ok, slightly better than average. Most of that blame can fall squarely on the marketing department for trying to sell something that is not what it claims.", "Is \"The Sickness\" worth watching? I think so. Especially if you go into it thinking that the title of the film is \"The Sickness\".", "As i've hardly read any reviews that even remotely cover my view of the movie, i decided to do my very first one.\nFirst of all, the bad Rating is both (un-)justified.\nOn the one hand, it's unjustified because the movie is absolutely awesome and works amazingly well.\nOn the other hand, it's justified because the advertising of the movie was completely misleading. This is not a horror movie about some monster. It doesn't even really need that much in it that you could call supernatural.", "What it achieves, is accuracy. It's supposed to be completely realistic, and the characters are meant to be as human as they can be.\nWe don't get that many obvious goofs as in most other movies of a similar genre, although we get one major one.\nThe major goof is that, no matter how you put it, the red door being opened doesn't add up. Joel's character, Paul, says in the beginning that he has the only key to that door. The movie however only gives us two possibilities: Either Travis opened the door and lied about it or didnt remember it because of sleepwalking or anything of the kind, or little Andrew did it, supposedly also sleepwalking. The latter seems to make the most sense, but it really doesnt matter which of the two you choose as your version, since you have the same problem in both cases: Why did they have the key to unlock the door? This is also not correctly addressed when the families meet afterwards, where Paul having the only key is just completely ignored. The door seems to have unlocked all by itself, so either Travis or Andrew were able to open it.", "But that is only a minor fault, compared to what the movie does achieve: It shows us how inhumane humans can get when it comes to defending their loved ones in a hostile environment. And the plot always lets the characters do what they are supposed to do, there are no faults in the logic.", "The plot seems realistic because it develops the way it develops and does not care about anything like traditional schemes. It ends abrupt, but with all being said that had to be said.", "All in all, i'd gladly give the movie a 10/10. But that one major plothole wont close, no matter how hard i think about it. Nevertheless, a special movie that is absolutely astonishing.", "While it's not necessarily a horror movie like it was said to be, It Comes at Night is still chilling and nightmarish but in a quite different way from most horrors. There is no palpable antagonist (not that's known of, anyways).\nThe villain of the movie is fear and paranoia of becoming sick and dying at the hands of an unknown virus. It drives the characters to turn against each other and become monsters.\nAlong with that, there's still the mystery of whether or not there was actually something out there. I mean, what was the dog barking at anyways? Who opened the door? How did the dog get so mutilated besides just being infected? When audiences say \"nothing comes at night\", they're very wrong. The anxiety and fear running rampant through the characters was what came at night and also, a possible unknown force. It Comes at Night is less of a film like A Quiet Place and something more like a modern take on Twilight Zone's \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\" but if it was 5 times darker.", "Normally I'm quite a fan of slow moving movies building suspense, which this does quite well... Its edgy and suspenseful... Quite well acted and keeps you guessing.", "But if you are expecting something coming at night or a decent ending you will be disappointed.... ", "Avoided putting spoilers here and each to their own but the end left me feeling I've just wasted so much time watching it... ", "Thinking about it, the build up to the ending and the ending itself isn't that bad so I have just changed the score from a 3 to 4", "The movie does ask questions that answered which is fine to a degree but it does build the tension well, get you think how characters would interest with each other in times like this but....", "There's an hour and a half I'm not getting back...", "(SPOILER ALERT) NOT A DAMN THING COMES AT NIGHT. THAT WAS 90 MINUTES WASTED, AND WORTH NOTHING. THE PEOPLE WHO BACKED THIS TRASH OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR PUTTING OUT SUCH TRASH. THE GRANDPA WAS KILLED IN THE DAYTIME, THE DOG WAS KILLED IN THE DAYTIME, THE FAMILY WAS KILLED IN THE DAYTIME, SO WTH WAS SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN AT NIGHT? LOL, THAT WAS SUCH A WASTE!", "Me and my partner was quite excited about watching this film based on the trailer expecting there to be more to it however we couldn't have been more wrong. It leaves you with so, so many questions on near enough every basis. I honestly wish we turned it off half way through as we wouldn't have missed anything important and would have saved ourselves a lot of time."]},

This is an artistically rendered film about human nature, especially when under duress. I came away from it haunted and sad. It's not a movie you watch to cheer yourself up, but it's well done and its overarching message is disturbing but also true: Despite our gift for higher reasoning, we fundamentally are animals of survival like every other creature on the planet.", "My main issue--and I didn't have many--with this movie was the way the female characters were portrayed. The older woman, Sarah, is a key character--she could've been the central character--but she wasn't given many lines aside from expressions of distress and exasperation--and the camera often finds her in the peripheral view. The younger woman, Kim, is traditionally sexy, \"pretty,\" flirty, and cute. And the film is so generous as to let us hear her have a breathy orgasm. Ultimately, between the two female characters, we get to experience Madonna-Whore in real-time, which YES is a little bit offensive. However, I think it's just a case of a dude not knowing how to write three-dimensional women, or at the very least wanting to write three-dimensional women and struggling with it. ", "This is absolutely a male-centric film, which is fine, but it could've been stronger if the female characters were more three-dimensional.", "Overall, 24 hours later, I'm still haunted by this movie. Strong story, haunting imagery, deft acting, fairly skillful writing. It's not uplifting, but it has depth and import, especially in these precarious times. This movie shows us one very possible realization of our future.", "I have seen many reviews from idiots that read something similar to '' nothing comes at night'' and that makes me ashamed to be human. When horror films don't have cheap jump scares they are immediately found to be boring and therefore bad. Hell. I even saw one review that complained about nobody getting eaten by a monster. I admit the marketing for this film was misleading but it's really a sad thing that nobody will watch a fantastic film unless they are tricked into watching it. Anyway on with the review. This film was fantastic it made me feel genuinely frightened and nauseated with the way tension is built using the superb lighting and uneasy camera movement, the score also adds to the tension. The main theme of the film is paranoia, therefore many questions aren't answered. A lot of people have complained about this but they fail to see that leaving the questions unanswered helps us associate with the sense of paranoia the characters are experiencing. The performances were inconsistent sometimes good sometimes not. My favourite actor was the teenage kid he really had a breakout performance and I'm looking forward to seeing him in other things in the future. Everyone else was fine, nothing special. They use a lot of dream sequences to get scares which I think is a bit lazy and at one point in the film the aspect ratio changes weirdly. However those are my only problems. One really admirable scene in particular is this POV shot closing in on the red door, I loved the sense of dread and the sense to can't escape. Really well made horror scene. On the whole I loved this slow paced but enjoyable film and can't wait for this directors next work, watch it.", "'It Comes At Night' is technically a horror film, but there's no standard horror stereotypes to be found, other than a good use of darkness and lights/lanterns. It's definitely more of a mystery/psychological thriller, with a hint of 'Outbreak'/'Contagion' thrown in. It's nice that instead of following the pandemic, you don't know what it is, what caused it or what's happening around the world - the film stays with just the one family: Paul (Edgerton), Sarah (Ejogo) & their son, Travis (Harrison Jr.) in their house in up-state New York.", "When another family - Will (Abbott) & Kim (Keough) - form a truce with Paul, they all seem to be making the best of life in the post-apocalyptic world. However, things aren't always that simple and there's plenty of moments where you question some decisions, but wonder if you would act any different in the same situation?", "There's a great score, building tension and action when needed, and great use of light, especially in the forest. No spoilers here, but this is certainly not your typical thriller/drama, with a pretty unexpected ending. While there're not a heap of scares, there's plenty of pressure built up and some interesting twists. All five of the actors are great, with Harrison Jr. being particularly good as the teenage son trying to cope with the new world.", "I heard very mixed things about this film some love it, most HATE it. So I finally watched it myself and discovered a lovely horror film that made me feel actually horrified. If you like The Witch, Under the Skin, or The Shining, you'll probably like this.", "FYI this movie is quiet, atmospheric, and character driven. If you like Jump scares and \"modern\" horror coventions then you'll probably hate this movie for being slow and not explaining every detail.", "If you want the basic plot, read the synopsis. You know my recommendation.", "It Comes At Night is a horror film that came out this year in Summer and considering I never got to see it,and cause it just was released on DVD here in the UK,I decided to buy it and watch it! Well,what do I haft to say,It Comes At Night is a pretty good movie. The film follows a pretty creepy and isolated plot about a family of three who live in a boarded up house in the middle of the forest after something mysterious occurred leaving the world with few survivors and then,a mysterious family move in with them. The film was really creepy and did not leave too many answers,but like loads of people say,sometimes it's better left unanswered. The acting in this film was really good from Joel Edgerton and Carmen Ejogo as well as Christopher Abbot,the ending to the film was pretty good but I personally felt like it should have been better then what everything lead up to,but..ah! It was OK! It Comes At Night is a pretty good horror film you should see if you like those dull,but creepy horror films like The Witch or Under The Skin and stuff", "Good grief, is this the feel-bad movie of the year or what?", "A family of survivalists have holed themselves up in an isolated house in the wake of some biological incident, the details of which are left vague, but which has resulted in a virus that kills anyone who contracts it. When another survivor with a family stumbles upon them, they must then decide whether or not to turn their backs or extend a helping hand. It's a parable that examines where the instinct to protect oneself and those he loves ends and the impulse for basic human decency begins.", "I guess I'd have to say that \"It Comes at Night\" was effectively done, because it left me feeling absolutely awful, and I had trouble shaking it. But I would also have trouble shaking the image of someone getting run over by a car -- no one would have to present it artistically for it to get to me. The final moments of \"It Comes at Night\" go places few movies dare to go, but it might make a viewer have to decide whether it's dramatically satisfying or cheaply manipulative. ", "Grade: C", "A family of three survives the apocalypse (some type of disease \u2014 and that's really all the information the audience gets) in a large, boarded up house in the woods. A stranger breaks in looking for water, and the father (played by Joel Edgerton) decides to trade water for some of the stranger's food. They apparently bond so well that the stranger and his wife and young child move in Edgerton's house. For a while they all live happily like a hippie commune until an event brings the possibility of disease within the house, an event that is never fully explained and is one reason why this movie gets a low grade. From this point on, some of the worst natures of people in times of crisis comes out, mostly from Edgerton; and this is what \"It Comes At Night\" is truly about, the monstrous nature of people that lie dormant, waiting for the right moment to emerge.", "My most memorable, movie moment of \"It Comes At Night\" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Edgerton is tracking a mother and her young son, finds them, aims his rifle at them and\u0085", "The extremely misleading title of \"It Comes At Night\" will frustrate many viewers because the title and trailers leads us to believe there is a monster out there stalking people at night, which is not the case. The lack of info on how the disease is transmitted, and several plot holes will further aggravate the viewer, as is proved in the overwhelmingly negative reviews in so many outlets. But I happen to like this movie's study in human nature in times of disaster and the question it poses: what price will you pay for survival?", "Mannysmemorablemoviemoments", "It seems hipster tentacles can't even circumvent the horror genre. Apparently, this lameocrity was hyped by various skinny guys with glasses who drink at Starbucks and discuss Socrates at length. As every hipsteravalanche, so too this one must have started by chance from one hipster - let's call him Hipster X - who then like an infected zombie spread the disease to other hipsters. After a week, 100s of hipster bloggers, vloggers and whatevers were hyping this crap over the internet.", "The truth? This is an almost generic post-apocalyptic drama that serves no purpose, has no point, and repeats cliches from dozens of other such films. Perhaps hipsters were excited with the fact that a mixed-race family are the main protagonists: you know, \"diversity\" and all that. Just wildly speculating at this point, because I really cannot latch on to anything that is vaguely original, let alone interesting.", "But silly me! Hipsters are suckers for the boring and the cliched, they eat that crap up with relish.", "The film is not only incredibly slow and boring - especially the first half which is a chore to sit through - it is also stupid in its conclusion. The Star Wars guy gets repeatedly beaten into the head with a rock, full force, yet stands up as if he'd just been slapped a bit. Awfully unrealistic, especially for a movie that was going for realism. Almost as dumb was his wife's reaction to this rock-bashing: she doesn't shoot the other guy straight away, but hesitates for way too long. Anyone, even the biggest pacifist would have shot him to protect their spouse, already after the first blow.", "But what am I doing, looking for logic flaws in a very boring movie? It makes no difference because the ending is stupid and predictable, and the monotony of the first hour had already defeated the viewers by this point.", "Don't believe the hype. This is a complete waste of time, utter drivel.", "This should be classified as psychological thriller and not horror. This movie answers none of the questions that it's major actions lead to. It expects the audience to \"imagine\" why and how everything is happening. A door that supposedly only had one key was magically opened by a 5 year old barely old enough to reach the lock and they never explained why or how this happened. They didn't even discuss the disease and how it's spread. Slow, vague and predictable conclusion", "Really... nothing. Can't believe it has 6 point something evaluation.", "It is one of those movies that make no sense (like most of A24 films), but this time most of us felt that way and i am so glad that happened. Most of the times these movies are so overrated...", "It's an extremely well-crafted movie. I can say i never took my eyes off the screen once and was always extremely interested in the plot throught the movie. I expected a more \"clich\u00e9\" movie or an actual monster, but i think what i got was much better.\nAs someone with anxiety, this movie speaks to me on another level. The thing that actually comes at night is the insecurity, fear, strangers, the unknown of the world outside and inside your mind. That is much scary than any monster or creature in my opinion.\nThe characters actually felt real and like the events of the movie were actually happening, by the way they reacted to things (sometimes without thinking).\nThe ending and all of the questions left unaswered left kind of a bitter and nervous feeling over me. I guess that was the point all along, so it 100% did it's job.", "Loved the realistic deep thought out drama of the movie. However, I kept waiting to see what exactly is it that comes at night. The title itself made me mad in the end not so much the actual movie. It was quite slow and maybe a little too deep in some scenes as it dragged on. I think they could of had some extra action or adventure scenes, like out in the woods. Overall it was entertaining, not scary if that's what your expecting or wanting.", "The audience is not wrong on this one. Indeed, nothing comes at night. Not sure how that became the working title of this film. It's pretty much your run of the mill paranoia hysterical festival of bad choices and stupid things that are irritating to me but apparently all Americans want in film and television. Thing is, it's not the worst thing out there if you try to ignore what you went in expecting. It's shot well. Has good acting. But in general it is boring and pointless. I don't recommend this one unless you're desperate for more apocalyptic survival pastimes.", "Nothing.", "This film shows the story of the Nothing family after the death of Nothing due to the Nothing illness, which spreads to nothing. The family then falls into nothing when another nothing walks up to them.", "I'm looking for something in this film.\nDidn't found it yet.", "This movie has an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I decided to watch it and it was the biggest waste of time. Any horror or thriller movie that has unecessary sex scenes is a warning the movie will be crap and is attempting to makeup for this with sex. The summary states the second couple frequently get intimiate and of course we have to see and hear this although it contributes nothing to the plot. I decided to keep watching and was terribly disappointed at how lackluster the ending was. The only 'scary' scenes were the dream sequences which of course is a cheesy way to convey true horror. Anyone can do a cheap jumpscare dream sequence that offers nothing to the plot. It's just an excuse to scare the watcher when they can't do it with a decent plot. Horrible movie.", "I have read many reviewers question about the end. The last scene shows mom and dad sitting on the table. They are infected by their son.

The cast performs exceptionally well, even though some characters are annoying due not their poor acting chops, but the actions their characters take during the film.", "There's also a feeling of isolation that accompanies the story, adding to the tension that if anything goes awry with our characters, they are truly alone and left to fend for themselves.", "I was pleased to discover that this film doesn't commit to any horror cliches associated with \"cabin in the woods\" stories. I feel it deserves a far better score than the current 6.2 it currently carries.", "Check it out, you'll be happy you did.", "Needed more ..everything. I expected a better movie. It was boring", "Horror is the fear we experience after something scary has happened; terror is the fear we experience before something scary has happened. It Comes at Night is much more interested in terror than horror. An infection of some kind has spread throughout the world (the details are fuzzy) and two families, having escaped urban areas, are holed up in a cabin in the woods. One of the sons, Travis, has bad nightmares and insomnia. Everyone wears gas masks and gloves and the doors are locked at night. There might be something out in the woods, but it's unclear. I won't say anymore specifics, but by the end of the film not everything is tied up in a neat bow and there are a lot of holes left deliberately open -- it's not a perfect, circular film. This is the type of film where you rush to Reddit to read all the fan theories. There are a couple of jump scares but this movie is more interested in what goes on in our minds when we hear a bump in the night, how we fill all the blanks. There's something wordless and imageless that exists in the depth of our imaginations that's connected to fear -- a movie monster is always less scary once it's on screen and out of our imaginations -- and it's that something that It Comes at Night tries to tap into, and pretty successfully too. It's unnerving.", "+5 for some really great suspenseful moments in the woods and of the red door.\nIf you want to be told a complete story, do not waste your time here. If you're good with a pretentious \"my script was left unfinished for art, duh, you don't get it?\" type thing, to get some nice slow burn tension then go for it.", "I enjoyed it, and liked the character's. Very creepy and could imagine many scenarios that might play out like that.", "Firstly, this is not a bad film contrary to other reviews. Good acting and ambiance. Not a horror, but a psychological thriller. Really enjoyed it up to the end, which leaves as many questions as you had at the start, which I hate. It's like a snippet into a bigger story, but the snippet is too small to leave you fulfilled.", "This is a little above average, decent film. It has limited characters so you can focus, which gives the movie the props of a smart directing, it discombobulated me a bit, and I was left riddled with uncertainty over it, however, I couldn't abominate it because it did very well as an intense horror film. What makes it special is that it doesn't use the startling effects to scare you, rather, a scary atmosphere to give you the thrills. A lot of viewers will find this movie strange because this is an unusual psychological haunting type of movie it's not what people are used to see. I believe it is a challenging scenario for the director to make a closed atmosphere with paranoid psychoses a frightening movie and play with the thin line between reality and delusion.", "Going into this movie after watching the trailer I was really excited to see what this movie was really about and all the hype around it. The trailer left me wanting more and then I watched the movie and now I wish I never watched the trailer in the first place. For clarification this movie is not a horror film, but a psychological thriller instead. This movie is 90 minutes of boredom because it is something you have already seen 1000 times before. The plot is predictable and all the characters are unlikable. I really did not care at all about what happened to these characters at the end of the film. Also the dialogue is generic and repetitive. I really blame the script for the failure of this movie. Going in I had really high expectations and now I'm left with nothing, but disappointment. This movie raises questions that are never really answered in the end. Without giving anything away, the climax is nothing worth writing home about. Overall if you want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then this is the movie for you.", "I hung on for the ride, thinking this movie was a slow burn that would eventually unveil some twists and turns, or at least some explanations that would be interesting. But it never does that. I feel like it wanted to be a piece of serious, dark subtlety but it ended up just being boring and vague."]},

He wants you to use your own imagination. I think Man should be more afraid of himself than anything lurking in the woods. When the apocalypse comes mankind is his own worst enemy. Instead of working together to find a way, mankind kills off each other in a futal attempt to secure his own family and things. That never seems to work does it? The red door is a metaphor between life and death for this family. It keeps out the bad, and keeps in the good. It keeps out the disease, but does it, the grandfather just died. Maybe the son Travis was already infected by his grandfather. Maybe he opened the door in one of his nighmares looking for the dog and he is the one who infected the little boy. My take is that Travis was already sick from his grandfather, thus the vivid nightmares, or gets sick retriving his dog, and doesn't remember wandering around at night and leaves the RED DOOR (safety door) open. Once the door is open Hell is unleashed, thus the red color used on the door. Man thus creates his own hell on earth, turning his back on mankind, brother killing brother to protect his own, sounds biblical??? Just my take on this movie, use your imagination a little more, love this director!!! \nThere is a similar movie out there called RETREAT from 2011 with Thandie Newton and Cillian Murphy from 28 days later - give that one a look if you want more answers in a movie.", "Terribly mis-marketed movie.

Take a family desperate for survival in an apocalyptic world, a regular, loving, moral family. Now set them in a landscape where they do not know who to trust. There are no heroes nor villains; there are no all right or wrongs. \nI can't say I enjoyed it -- it was too psychologically disturbing for that. But it made me think, long after the credits ended.

So, I'll try to examine this film as unbiasedly as possible. Nevertheless, its his, among others', performance that holds the film together for an impacting impression. \n \nIt Comes At Night is not a film that will answer all of your questions. It isn't as much about the world, as it is about the people. This world is unfamiliar, but humanity is digestible, even when pushed to its darkest limits. \n \nHorror is defined differently in this film. This film lacks jump-scares and graphic violence to wet the tongue of gory-hungry fans. Nevertheless, its horrific nature is conveyed through the fearful mind of Travis (played by Kelvin Harrison Jr.). As well as the phenomenal acting of Joel Edgerton and Carmen Ejogo. The placement of this family in such a dark, mysterious world changes everything, yet changes nothing. It only furthers the strive for a happy, successful life.

Supernatural or science fiction demons might be temporarily unnerving but films about unseen terror can reach deep into our psyche. The film It Comes at Night (2017) is an example of how less is often more in cinema: a low-budget film that avoids the usual digital spooks to focus on primal fear and survival.", "The storyline and setting are minimalist. Without any narrative clues, we abruptly join a panicked family in an isolated forest cabin about to dispose of a family member who has broken out in some form of disfiguring sickness. We hear heavy breathing behind masks and follow a still conscious body being dragged through claustrophobic cabin rooms and narrow hallway then outside to a shallow grave. It takes several scenes to piece together what just happened, and all the time the danger remains unseen. This terror atmosphere is maintained throughout the story as we watch a family fighting to survive a futuristic biological catastrophe. The father Paul (Joel Edgerton) has boarded-up and sealed the cabin and everyone must follow strict rules about exposure to the outside. He does whatever it takes to protect his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo) and rebellious 17-year old son Travis (Kevin Harrison Jnr.) from the contagion. When an intruder breaks in he is dealt with harshly until Paul takes pity and allows him to bring his wife and child to share the cabin. The new family brings deadly risk and eventually chaos.", "Rarely do we find a horror film so focused on the nature of fear itself. The \"It\" of the film's title lies more within the human psyche than outside. It's a whirlpool of night shadows, Travis' coming-of- age nightmares, and the imagined and real danger of contact with anyone outside of the family. The untethered camera-work accentuates the claustrophobic isolation, interspersed with close-ups shots of wide-eyed fear that is palpable. We only know what the camera lets us see and the narrative withholds explanation or backstory, leaving viewers to their imagination. The acting performances of Joel Edgerton and Kevin Harrison are uniformly excellent and allow events to unfold from completely different points of view.", "If you are a horror fan expecting blood and gore you will not find it here. Some will still be waiting for the big reveal until the credits and not realise that this is about atmospherics and unseen inner demons. This film works both as a narrative about responding to a dystopian threat and as a psychological study of human potential for destruction. When Paul takes primal laws of survival into his own hands it challenges the viewer to walk in his shoes with a loaded gun and ask \"what would I do?\" So many horror films fall limp at the finishing line but the final scene of this one will send shivers down your spine.", "Although this turned out to be another one of my favorite films this year, this also proved to be another one of those films that most people will let slip by.

Why does this industry allow this kind of rubbish films to get this exposure when they do not deserve it at all?

I am not going to say anything else since I went in the film knowing nothing about the plot and this made the experience even better. Watching this film I'm glad that I didn't knew what was it about. First things first, the cinematography, lighting, production design, and the music were all amazing. The cinematography was subtle enough that it wasn't obvious and it was expertly crafted throughout the film. The way the camera moved was great since it fitted with the paranoia the characters felt. The lighting was brilliant. Since most of the film is set at night, the sequences when there were nighttime was so real and surreal that it took me off guard. I am so glad that they really thought about every aspect of the film since there are a lot of movies of this genre that don't even give a sh*t about their presentation, their only concern is to spook the audience with jump scares and what not. The production design was also brilliant with a lot of subtle references to the outside world. The direction was phenomenal as it wasn't obvious and it was very subtle. The information given and what was not given was so refreshing since it never explains to the audience what exactly is going on on the outside world. You can easily infer it and it is not painfully obvious nor was it very vague. A movie that did this wrong was World War Z and a movie that did this right was Shaun of the Dead. It is so incredibly rare to find a film that actually respects its audience and actually makes them think when the film ends. You can say whatever you want about the miss marketing but the film itself is very clever. The script was great as it took its time with its characters and the story was not forced in a way that you wouldn't be interested in it. It lets the characters blossom first, then it tells its story. The characters are so real and their decisions are very clever. There are so many scenes where the characters are interacting and its so tense because you really do care about them and because its really well made. The tension-filled scenes are fantastic and really elevate this film. Not only are they incredibly made, but they were subtle enough that the audience can't really tell what will happen next. The ending is really great as it leaves a lot of things for interpretation and it doesn't give you all of the answers you wanted, and I love when a director makes those types of decisions since it is really ballsy. The acting throughout is stellar except for one character. I thought that the mother in the film really had no purpose and she didn't really act very well. She didn't convince me that she was a mother nor that she was scared. The film is not perfect. There is one sound effect that took me out of the film and there is one decision made in the second act that contradicted the characters previous choice. The character of the mom wasn't really well developed and she really couldn't act. Nevertheless, this is one of the best films of this year and it is still debatable if this is my favorite horror film of the year, but it is a damn great one. 9/10", "This film..... was so incredibly bad that that's an understatement. Waited an hour an half for it to take off and it just sat on the runway lol. And then what's the title about? It comes at night? What the hell did the title have to do with the movie, I'm still trying to figure that out.. Smh. I'm sooooo mad I just spent my money on that. I would have rather sat in L.A. traffic. I would have rather watched NASCAR.. And I'm black! That might have been just as bad as the movie the witch. I mean seriously. And all I'm seeing is all these positive reviews?? Like wtf? Are we watching the same movie? That might have been worse than waiting on church to end as a child... That might have been worse than having the runs.. It comes at night? What the hell comes at night? I'm still waiting to find that out! I'm like..... Ahhh, so is something coming at night? Nope, guess not. Errrrr I'm so mad. I wasn't even gone have a drink tonight, now I gotta get DRUNK!", "I have never, ever in my adult existence wanted a refund for a movie I saw in a theater until I saw this movie. It's not a horror film, it's hardly a thriller. There are a few moments of suspense but at the end of the movie it is all for naught. I kid you not, nothing happens in this poor excuse for a film. How it's getting good reviews blows my mind! ", "I spent $30 for two tickets and I regret every cent and second I spent on it. DO NOT pay money to see this movie. Catch it on Netflix or watch it at someone else's house if you have absolutely nothing else to do.", "I'm not sure what movie people were watching that they are giving these good reviews for, but it certainly wasn't this cinematic abortion. The one positive I can give is the acting wasn't bad. It's a shame that any effort was wasted on this film. It Comes At Night should either be titled \"I Should've Never Come Tonight,\" or \"Nothing Happens at Night.\" Two hours of sitting next to giggling Teena on their cell phones in the theater was bad enough, but I thought, \"Hey, maybe the big reveal at the end will be worth it.\" Wrong. Terrible story, terrible ending, and the people that wrote and filmed this movie should have to be legally bound to never make another movie again. If you do venture out to see this steaming pile of yak feces, remember that I warned you. Save your $12. Spending it on crack would be a better investment. For the love of all that is good, heed my words: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS POOR EXCUSE OF A MOTION PICTURE. The only people I'd recommend see this movie are teens that need a place to get freaky and can find this playing at a drive in. You can focus on your freak without being distracted by the incredibly terrible excrement of a movie. If I could give it negative stars, I would.", "This movie is listed as a horror movie. I have always enjoyed a creepy horror movie. By that I mean something that isn't like the slasher movies with loud jump scares and gore but rather the type that include supernatural elements and make you uncomfortable. Movies such as The Exorcist, Blair Witch Project, It Follows and The Woman In Black are just a few that come to mind.", "That said if you loved The Witch than this movie is for you! Similarities of these two movies are 1- Neither of them should have been classified as horror movies, 2- Neither of them had any characters that you really cared about and 3- Both of them had endings that had most of the people that viewed these movies with me shaking their heads in disbelief that they wasted their time and money.", "I have to say that whoever is giving this pointless mess 10 stars must have money invested in it. It's one of the best shot, worst movies that I can remember. The trailers are COMPLETELY misleading, and the title has no bearing or reflection on the actual film! Nothing comes at night-as a matter of fact- nothing comes ever! As near as you can figure out, some kind of unknown disease is spreading around, and this is a few days in the lives of 2 families living in a house in the woods. They take showers, they eat, they chop wood, they act like a horde of rabid undead rhinos could kill them at any moment, and then....AND THEN... NOTHING f*cking happens-ever-at all. Tons of neck tightening melodrama to watch 6 A-holes camp in the woods. If you want a similar feeling without driving to the cinema, take $10 and ball it up very small and then throw it away. Next take a semi comfortable chair into a dark room with a closet. Open the closet door part way and stare into it whilst sitting in the chair. At the end of 2 hours walk out proclaiming \"WTF did i just watch?\" like everyone else in the theater I went to. I've never actually seen a whole auditorium full of people laugh collectively at a horror movie before today....", "I would not waste Redbox money on this movie. I saw a \"plug\" on GMA and was excited to see it. I have never felt more robbed by a movie in my life. I hate to give negative criticism, but I think people should be warned against seeing this one. There was no plot, no action, no thrills, nothing scary or overly gross, no beginning and no end. It was obviously a low budget film and I can never get back the two hours I wasted watching it.

Hurray for me!\"", "Sorry if I sound like a jerk, I really do prefer to be a nice person most of the time... and I sound like a condescending tool here, but... I mean this is really how I feel... These are my uninhibited opinions. I believe their are sneaky tricks in writing that make the viewer/reader feel smart, but at the same time don't take that much brain-power or intelligence on the writers part, and I feel like that's what the author of this movie did. He wrote a simplistic plot in a way that allows reader's pride to be aroused, thus allowing him to get away with lazy writing.", "Me, personally, I'm all about plot. And I found the plot of this too simple. Maybe plot isn't what your brain's taste buds are about, maybe your more of an \"atmosphere\" kind of person when it comes to movies.

", "=)", "The 'Doore' of Red Death. A24's highly anticipated horror film\u00a0\"It Comes at Night\" by writer- director Trey Edward Shults looks beautiful and beckons for attention, but fails to live up to the storytelling and payoff of A24's\u00a0The\u00a0Green Room. Another A24 film in the vein of\u00a0It Comes at Night is 2016's\u00a0The Witch, which was ultimately a failed attempt to capture the magic of a horror/mystery film and leave audiences with too many unanswered questions. The only \"terrifying ambiguity\" (to quote The\u00a0Huffington Post), in this film, is just how terrifying it is to realize you just dropped money on a film that works better for Netflix, and the ambiguity comes from the plethora of underdeveloped plot elements.\u00a0Essentially,\u00a0It Comes at Night reminds me of a bad M. Night Shyamalan film (before he made his comeback with\u00a0The Visit and\u00a0Split). Like the aforementioned, the wind up is excellent but the delivery lacks any emotional impact and you're left with realizing that you never truly cared about any one of the characters. Character development is lacking and the third act is incredibly weak. However, there is something in particular that I find very interesting, and after reading other reviews, it seems to be something that has escaped most (if not all) the reviews at this point. That is the striking similarities between this film and the timeless classic short story\u00a0The\u00a0Masque of Red Death by the brilliant Edgar Allan Poe. From the painting on the walls of the house depicting the bubonic plague to the ominous red door, there are quite a few parallels between\u00a0It Comes at Night and\u00a0The Masque of Red Death.", "Nestled deep in the woods is a secluded boarded up house belonging to a family of three seeking refuge from an unknown threat. Whatever has caused this family to live off the grid and fend for their very survival is tasteless and odorless. Forced to wear gas masks whenever venturing out into the woods and even around their own home, the family is forced to take drastic measures to ensure there ability to avoid coming into direct contact with the disease. With only now way in or out of the house guarded by a red door, the family has stopped at nothing to protect themselves. One night, the family's house is broken into and they must decide what to do with the man and his family. Having dispensed with courteousness and generosity in order to guard against any and all possible threats, the family must decide whether to listen to the man or kill him right then and there. Their decision will spark a fire that spreads into their deepest fears.", "*spoiler alert* But, the analysis is fascinating.", "Okay, now I know that the preceding program describes what should be a brilliant horror film, but the problem lies in the film's excellent premise that is greatly flawed by poor storytelling, development, and realization. Lack of connection to any one of the characters is also partly responsible for the lackluster experience of watching this horror-thriller with a hint of mystery and dystopia. The only saving grace the film has is the connection to elements of Poe's\u00a0Masque of Red Death. For starters, the camera draws the audience's (and diegetic POV) attention to a painting of a depiction of the bubonic plague (or black death). At first, I was puzzled as to why this painting. Then as I go through the movie, I realize why. Between the constant reference to and runtime spent on talking about and showing the red door, it hit me that this film reimagined Poe's short story and set it in a dystopian or post-apocalyptic time and place. If you are unfamiliar with\u00a0The Masque of Red Death, then I encourage you to read it or watch it on YouTube. It is allegory on the inevitability of death no matter how \u00a0hard you protect yourself, how much money you have, or how powerful you are. It also contains allusions to the\u00a0seven deadly sins and the fate of those who party in the wake of mass death among a lower class of people. Although I find the short short to be a stronger narrative than Shults' variation on this reimagination of the classic tale.", "Both the short story and this film contain people hiding out in a fortress. Whereas\u00a0The Masque of Red Death's Prince Prospero is held up ins abbey with his wealthy and noble friends while the red death is killing off the rest of the kingdom, A24's\u00a0It Comes at Night features a typical American family living off the land and secured in their rather tutor-looking mountain lodge. Like in\u00a0Red Death, the family in\u00a0It Comes receives an uninvited guest one night. Here's where we see some difference. In Poe's story, the guest is dressed to attend the masquerade ball and in this film, the guest attempts to break into the home. Although both stories take different approaches to the second act, once thing is in common. And that is the taking in of an outsider. All through the second act, there are hints at something not being right--a constant uneasiness. That apprehension and anxiety regarding the unknown works in the respective stories favors. The emotional impact and psychological payoff differs between the short story and film. Yes, the endings are very similar but feel incredibly different. You'll just have to read\u00a0The\u00a0Masque of Red Death and watch\u00a0It Comes at Night to know for yourself.", "If you're searching for a thriller to watch this weekend, as it is rain in many parts of the country, then perhaps you should watch Universal Pictures'\u00a0The Mummy instead. However, if you are curious about how well\u00a0It Comes at Night parallels Poe's short story, this definitely check it out. Not entirely sure why it's rated R, but in case that's important to you.

Although he has affection for the husband, Will (Christopher Abbot), and his comely wife, Kim (Riley Keough), as well as their young son, Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner), Travis witnesses what the damage allowing the outside world into your world is. The decisions each family must make reflect contemporary isolationist global policies to the extent that one's own survival may lead to the destruction of another.", "It Comes at Night is one of the best horror films in the last few years, ranking with The Witch, Blair Witch Project, and 10 Cloverfield Lane for minute by minute suspense and meta questions about trust, charity, and the evil of mankind.

What little does happen makes you regret the time you've lost in your life that you'll never get back again. I suppose I was expecting a horror movie but that never happened. As a journalist, I told a friend of mine who saw it with me at the 20 minute mark, if this were an article my editor would start cutting the story about now because there was very little going on beyond that point.

The movie is mostly about people being afraid of getting sick with a deadly virus and people getting killed because they are sick.", "'It Comes at Night' was a strange title for this movie. It implies something that it's not, and that's a real shame. I think a lot of people are going to go into this movie expecting something very different from the actual product. I went back to watch the trailer after seeing the film just to see how exactly they had marketed this. Trailers today simply have to be avoided as much as possible because they give away far too much information about the film. The trailer for 'It Comes at Night' does imply a very differently paced film and also a much more violent and horror-like tone. I actually had some people in my theatre walk out about half way through the film. They were obviously in the mislead category.", "The film as it stands on its own is actually not bad. It's a patient movie that I would call more of a character study than anything else. There's some superb acting from the entire cast which is an absolute must in dialogue-heavy films. The let down in the film is the lack of creativity in the story. After you've seen the film I want you to ask yourself this question: did anything happen, at any point in the film, that felt truly original and like something I couldn't have come up with myself? The answer may be different for different people, but for me it would have to be a no. The film never delivers a knock-out blow to astonish the audience.", "Sadly I think the wrong type of audience are going to go and see this movie. People are going to go in looking for a straight up horror movie (with a title like 'It Comes at Night' how could you not?) and are going to be disappointed. Similarly people who would actually quite enjoy the type of film this is will never get to see it because they will be put off by the title and the film it implies. That's a real shame because this is an above average movie.", "The most pretentious movie you'll see all year! I saw this with a movie buddy at Nitehawk in Brooklyn. We were so pumped - the preview trailer looked great, seemed spooky (we love horror movies old and new). ", "We both hated it. We hated every minute of it. Easily the most pretentious movie of the year. The point I emphasized while having our post-movie drinks was this: this movie takes itself way, way too seriously. Jesus Christ, come on man. Everyone is sooooooooo serious. Everything is life or death. Come on, get over yourself. It tries too hard, and it's obvious that it does. ", "Another beef I have is that this is yet another short turned into a feature length film - it's got 15 minutes of content in a 90 minute movie. 75 minutes of filler.", "Which brings me to my final point: It's boring. Nothing happens. Super, super boring movie. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters, about the plot...nothing made me care at all. ", "This movie sucks. I am amazed at the praise heaped upon it from critics. Are you kidding me?! First year MFA students could have done better if they had the same budget. Get the hell outta here.", "Everyone involved with this turkey should be totally embarrassed and ashamed for being in any way connected to it. And man, I really like Joel Edgerton...he must have had urgent bills to pay because it's hard to reconcile him being in it. ", "Worst movie of the summer. So bad I can hardly believe it.", "I am not sure I watched the same movie that everyone else did. One of the most boring movies I have ever seen, fell asleep twice. The movie left you asking \"what the heck?\" There was no explanation and the ending was just dumb. No reason behind any of the actions in the movie. Definitely not a horror by any means. Would call it a made for TV movie and surely would NOT pay a dime for it!", "Well first of all, the dog died. WTF! And the ending seemed so rushed it was unbelievable. AND THEY NEVER EVEN SAY WHAT COMES AT NIGHT, THEY JUST IMPLIED THAT IT WAS THAT SLENDER MAN THING WHEN TRAVIS GOES ALL ARTSY FOR NO REASON. They probably could of had a better ending if they didn't spend 5 minutes talking about bread pudding. But honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen."]},

If you wanna understand it fully I would recommend watching this multiple times. It Comes at Night is a fantastic movie and one of the best of the year so far!", "I don't normally see many films without seeing a trailer or any promotion, or with little or no actors in it I know, but this scary movie had fairly positive feedback, and I like to be surprised now and then, so I made an exception for once. Basically a highly contagious disease has ravaged the outside world, secure within a house in the middle of the woods are Paul (Loving's Joel Edgerton, his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), and their teenage son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.). Sarah's father Bud (David Pendleton) contracts the disease, he is killed and his body is burned in a shallow grave. The next night, an intruder is caught breaking in, the stranger, Will (Christopher Abbott), is tied to a tree overnight to confirm whether he is diseased or not. The next morning, uninfected, Will explains he did not know the house was occupied, he was looking for fresh water to help his own family, Will offers to trade their supply of food for water, Sarah suggests Will bring his family with him to the house, reasoning more people would make it is to defend, should anyone else discover their location. Paul agrees, he and Will go to collect his family, along the way they are ambushed by two men, Paul kills them, but accuses Will of setting him up, but Will points out that he fought them also, relieving Paul's mistrust. A few days later, Paul returns with Will, his wife Kim (Riley Keough) and his young son Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner), Paul and Sarah establish the rules they use to keep safe, including keeping the only entrance locked, keeping night time excursions to a minimum, and always going outside in daylight in a pair. One day, Travis's dog Stanley (Mikey) starts barking aggressively and chases an unseen presence in the woods, Travis follows the dog deeper into the woods before Stanley's barking stops, Travis insists to Paul and Will he heard something in the woods, but they decide to return home, Paul insists the dog knows its way home. That evening, Travis is awakened by a nightmare about his grandfather, he discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room, Travis takes him to his parents, then hears something downstairs, investigating he finds the front door ajar, he wakes Paul and Will who investigate further, they find Stanley bleeding and gravely sick, they kill and burn the dog. When Travis reveals the door was already open when going downstairs, Sarah suggests Andrew sleepwalked and opened the door, tensions begin to rise between the two families, Paul decides they should isolate themselves from each other in their own rooms for a few days, to calm down and ensure no one is infected. The next morning, Travis hears a distraught Kim telling Will they need to leave, Travis tells his parents Andrew is very likely infected, and as such, he may be infected himself, Paul and Sarah put on protective masks and gloves and take weapons to confront them, fearing they will steal food and water, or return later. Paul asks to be let in to see if Andrew is sick, Will draws a gun and takes Paul captive, Will insists his family are all healthy and demands to take food and water for them to leave, Paul and Sarah overwhelm Will and force him to step outside. Paul and Will have a brutal fight, until Sarah shoots and kills Will, Kim flees with Andrew into the woods, Paul fires after them, he kills Andrew, a hysterical Kim begs Paul to end her misery and kill her, and he does. Witnessing all this, Travis is dazed and vomits blood, he later spots signs of his own illness in the mirror, in the end Travis awakens with a full sickness, Sarah, also sick, comforts him as he dies, she and Paul, both infected, sit together at the dinner table in silence. I will firstly say that it is a very odd choice of title, there isn't really any \"it\" to see, the only \"it\" that be referred to is the disease, but anyway, the performances are all fine, the story is simple enough to follow, there are the small jumpy and bloody moments, but mainly it is creepy with the nervy atmosphere, unsettling dread, and the paranoia, a reasonable psychological horror. Worth watching!", "The movie was well acted (although Kelvin Harrison Jr was wasted, as he didn't have much more to do than stand around looking Thoughtful). There was a good sense of impending menace throughout, all the more so because neither the characters nor the audience was completely sure what was happening or who exactly was out there. The musical score was very good and added to the atmosphere.", "I would have liked at least a few questions answered, however. Why was Paul so aggressive? Had his family already been robbed or attacked? This was not explained (or, if it was, I missed it). I would have thought that survivors would naturally have grouped together to help one another out. ", "What was the point of tying Will to a tree with a bag over his head and his shirt off? If the idea was to see if he was infected, Paul could just have tied him up with his clothes on and no bag on the head, and periodically gone to check on him (whilst wearing his own protective headgear), given Will water, talked to him, etc. Equally safe and much more humane. ", "Similarly, I don't understand why the men in the woods would have started shooting at Paul's vehicle; why not at least try to flag him down and ask for help? After the men have been killed, Will suggests that they should have tried to get some information from them. Exactly! I would have thought that pooling experiences and info would be essential in a time of national crisis.", "Was the dog infected? If so, why so much blood? And as Paul has the only set of keys I don't see how a security door could be opened by a little boy sleepwalking (if that is in fact what happened).", "I didn't understand why Paul wouldn't just let Will and his family leave. And the shooting of Kim and Andrew was both unnecessary and barbaric.", "I suppose one is meant to infer from the ending that the parents were also infected and therefore no-one would survive. Was this supposed to be some indictment on human savagery and ignorance and how it will ultimately result in our annihilation? It was a hell of a miserable ending, I know that much.", "And finally \u2013 although perhaps I should have mentioned this first \u2013 WHAT exactly comes in the night? Fear? I know Travis had some pretty bad nightmares which seemed to be prophetic, given what eventually happened to him. Is that what comes at night \u2013 visions of the future?", "Now I don't mind unconventional horrors or slow haunting movies but this was extremely pathetic. Give me a camera, a house in the woods, add a couple of nightmares, and I could have made this film. Basically there are only 2-3 occasions where anything thrilling happens and the rest is just a pseudo banter regarding life after a post apocalyptic crisis. This movie is really misrepresented and imagine 28 Days Later with absolutely all the action removed. This is for post apocalyptic/zombie buffs who want a boring night with a cup of tea.", "This movie was confusing in that it was not a horror movie, which is how it is labeled in the description. My husband and I kept waiting for the \"scary\" parts, but there were none. I looked at my watch halfway through it and commented to my husband that this movie was boring. He agreed. There were several times when certain events in the story could have been made to be more interesting, but then those events fizzled out and were a dead end, and we were left confused, disappointed and, frankly, bored. We kept wondering what had happened, but there were no explanations as to why the families were in the situation that they were in. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even thought the actors were very good with what they had to work with.", "It Comes At Night is a disturbing, excellently shot post-apocalyptic drama. Joel Edgerton delivers a masterful performance as a father who is desperately trying to balance protecting his family and preserving his own humanity. The small cast around Edgerton are similarly excellent, specifically Kelvin Harrison Jr. who plays Edgerton's son. Harrison Jr.'s portrayal of an awkward young man immersed in a tragic world is truly eye-opening; he is definitely one to watch out for in future films.", "The cinematography is truly excellent throughout, with a great number of hand-held shots that add to the realistic feel. Tension is heavy and present from the first frame of the film to the last frame of the film. Credit to director Trey Edward Schults, another talented name to look out for in the future.", "One negative, if you could even call it that, is that the film is so tense and somber throughout that some viewers won't find this to be an enjoyable watch. In this way, it is reminiscent of 2004 post- apocalyptic drama The Road. Also, It Comes At Night is being marketed as a horror film, which it is not. While the film is scary at points, it does not fit the traditional conventions of a horror movie.", "Be forewarned; this movie isn't for the faint of heart. But, if you are prepared to embark on a grim exploration of humanity, with some scares along the way, this one is for you.", "Mate, the worst horror movie ever. There is absolutely no thrilling storyline. There is no actual story that is the red line throughout the movie, WHAT AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MY MONEY. The acting is pretty alright, with some unknown actor for me, but they did a pretty decent job. At least something to cheer about cause the movie isn't really worth considering.It appeared to be one mediocre episode from The walking dead.", "Was expecting a scary movie. Not a single frame of this film is scary. If you are looking for a post apocalyptic film this is for you. If you saw the title hoping it would be at ALL scary don't bother. There is nothing that \"comes at night\". Everyone in the theater was upset when it was over. We kept waiting for something scary to happen. This is a psychological thriller but not even that thrilling, the only parts that are close to scary are dream sequences. That aside, the acting is great. I would have rated this higher if it had a different title. There is literally, nothing that comes at night.", "This movie was sorta suspenseful and the cinematography was decent, but that's the best I can say, ", "The plot doesn't kick in until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The other 80 or so minutes make you feel like you'll see conflict or something, but nothing really happens. ", "The character are very flat and the actors rarely get a chance to actually act. Most of the movie is just the people being silent and staring around. I felt that I could not connect on a basic human level with any one of the six characters.", "With the whole \"It Comes at Night\", nothing comes at night. People expecting some kind of an antagonist or monsters are going to be very disappointed. There is no opposing force that is trying to get them. The title and the trailers are very misleading. ", "I went to see this movie with my friends and all 7 of us , expect for one, said this was the worst movie they've seen. It had very little entertainment value. ", "Don't waste your money. If you really want to see for any reason wait till it comes on Redbox or Netflix.", "This isn't a horror film.", "What you got with this film was a long Walking Dead episode with characters who are much less interesting and engaging, and with exactly one stupid zombie.", "Seriously, it nearly put me to sleep. If you're looking for horror, look elsewhere.", "Do not waste you money on this movie. Not scary at all. Ending was horrible. Too many loose ends...walked out of theater scratching my head...You never truly find out what \"it\" is. I've seen my fair share of scary movies, but this isn't one of them. Don't believe all the hype....Not sure this is the same movie all the people on here are reviewing.", "I feel sorry for people who took the title literally.\nI am a horror junkie who is very hard to please. I watched this on my laptop, alone, in the dark, with earbuds. I literally had to sleep with a light on later that night. This movie has terrific acting, believable dialog, and (although similar storylines have been made-this movie tells it well!) a horrific tale that may not be too far from reality.\nThe movie haunts me still.\nLoved it.", "2 seconds before the movie ended I was just about to tell my wife: \"If this ended now, it would really be awful\" - and then it ended! We were waiting for something to happen for a whole movie, for at least a vague explanation of what was happening and we got nothing. I mean I understand that sometimes a point of journey is the journey itself and not the destination, but here even the journey was bad.", "If I really tried to find something good here I would probably go for the tension the movie was building, but sadly in the end the tension just melted away...", "If you're expecting a supernatural Horror, a supernatural Thriller or any type of Horror/Thriller for that matter then turn away now because this film is none of those. It also has a very misleading title because after watching it, it leaves you wondering what exactly was it that came at night. The only thing that comes with this movie is sheer boredom and a seemingly endless tale of a whole pile of nothing.", "The people who have rated this film quite highly must have seen a completely different movie from what I watched as when I read some of the reviews they are definitely not describing a film that I had just seen. \"Skillfully directed\", \"masterpiece\", \"fantastic\", and \"extremely well crafted\" to quote a few adjectives that people have used for this nonsense. Each to their own, fair enough and I get that, but like I say, they must have seen a completely different movie from me.", "The film starts off in a way you don't expect a film to start, but neither pace nor interest gathers and it just trudges along painfully from one scene to the next. You do keep watching because you want to see if it DOES pick up, gets more interesting or just gets better in general but alas it does none of those and watching leaves turn brown during the Autumn is actually more interesting than what happens in this movie.", "The only plus point for me throughout the film was that it IS well acted and the characters are all pretty believable as they are trying to just survive whatever it is that has not long happened to the world.", "This really is a movie to avoid truly avoid though.", "It Comes At Night? It's honestly more like S*it Comes At Night.", "Watched this in cinema. Because the trailer looked cool.", "To be honest. Just watch the trailer instead of the movie. It highlights all the important bits of the movie, and doesn't explain anything. And that's fine, because the full movie doesn't explain anything either.", "It's probably my worst cinema experience i've ever had. I left the cinema wondering who these people in the movie were, why they were there, what was the problem they were facing, when did it happen and how I could get my money back.", "It started out spooky and it had some creepy scenes that made me cover my eyes waiting for something to jump out or ANYTHING and it never happened. It kept working you up to it then you would fall right off. And the end of the movie it left you hanging like crazy. I wasn't expecting something like the walking dead but I wanted to see more sick people. I would not recommend to anyone and will not watch again. Hopefully they didn't go negative at the box office.", "It comes at night. It comes at day. Actually, it doesn't come at all. Everything about this movie makes me feel as though my neighbor made this movie. Don't know my neighbor? That's the point. This movie somehow made it into the horror category. Nobody will ever be able to explain that one to me. Speaking of explaining, don't expect any answers while watching the movie, they aren't coming. I would potentially put this movie up against the film inside Idiocracy that won best picture. ", "That would still be a toss up. ", "If you're smart and value your time, I would truly avoid this movie at all cost.", "Very good psychological thriller - but a terrible horror movie. I've seen this movie advertised as horror and even the title supports that expectation. It is not a horror film - or at least I hope the film makers didn't mean for it to be. It is a slow, suspenseful psycho thriller tapping into survival instincts and what one will do to protect themselves and their families.", "As a fan of Joel Edgerton's, I make the effort to to see all his films at least once. He owes me for this one. I'll admit, the acting is excellent, but the movie itself is a waste of time.", "At most, this is a psychological thriller/ drama...Horror? Not. Even. Close.", "The film is full of loopholes and suggestion that never comes full circle to reveal what they were there for in the first place. This is not a spoiler, just a warning - Nothing comes at night, unless I missed the event completely.", "In conclusion, this is not a horror film by any standards, and it goes nowhere. At best, it is a look into the life of a paranoid family for about a week. It amounts to nothing, although the suspense keeps you hoping for a climax worthy of the title.", "Sad to report that you will have better ways to spend 90 minutes."]},

Simple, beautiful, humanistic. Brilliant film.", "(spoilers) Budget-Minded thriller \"It Comes at Night\" is better than average fare though with a larger budget and a little more risks and revelations in its story, it could've been an outstanding movie.

It's fairly minimalist style. \"It\" for some disappointed viewers is not the boogieman or a strange creature, but likely rather the plague. Actors give good performances, and the only real let-down in the story was the reaction and situation with the dog - which was unbelievable and manipulated for the story.

There are unanswered questions left, and that's OK though. Well acted and conceived. 7/10 - recommended", "\"It\" encompasses any unknown entity. It is what made that strange sound. It wafted up that peculiar sensation. \"It\" is the folder where we place all things foreign and discomforting. But It is not the enemy here.

And evil will enter unnoticed. Evil always comes as a welcomed guest.", "Sarah sits at the lantern-bathed dinner table clutching her husband's paw.

And in that respect, it hits it out of the park. ", "Unfortunately, this film was marketed as a horror, which understandably left some people hoping for something else unhappy.

It was not. But what it was, was actually quite good. A very taught human drama playing out in the isolated woods with the backdrop of a deadly pandemic sweeping through the countryside.

I was very excited when I heard of his film, although i'll admit I hyped it up a but too much. I think the main reason this movie was hated was that it was mismarketed, meaning people went into the film expecting some epic and tense new horror, and got a slow, apocalyptic instead. But I feel like nobody is actually critiquing the film for what it is, they are only giving the film a bad review because of what it isn't is. what I mean by that is all of the one star reviews never bring up qualities of the film, like it's acting. The only real complaint about this film I have seen people write is that it wasn't what they wanted, and that it hadn't lived up to the hype. So i'll try my best not to write a review not complaining how it \"wasn't as the trailer made it look\" and actually list my negatives nd positives, let's begin.\nI thought the film was superbly acted, brilliant performances all around, mainly carrying the movie. It was a joy to watch the actors give it their all.\nI thought the film mainly succeeded in it's slowburn style and I was still failry gripped throughout, although some parts not so much as the film did decide to drag them on a fair bit. Some of my negatives may be it's ending, like I know, arthouse films are like that. But I feel like they could've made it a bit less ambiguous, without spoiling the story, but still making the viewer guess instead of them going \"ugh that ending makes no sense\", so quite a big negative there. But you get the idea so i'll write my verdict and grade\nVerdict: While it may be too slow at parts, It Comes At Night maintains suspense and has some powerhouse performances, worth watching for A24 fans.\nGrade: B", "Felt like it was destined to be a good movie for the first 30 minutes. After that the story becomes painfully drawn out and maintains a very slow pace throughout. It doesn't really go anywhere and by the end I kicked myself for wasting all that time watching it. I guess I must have really hated the ending. On the plus side, the acting is excellent, cinematography and directing also very good.", "But it started to feel like the real horror was how the writers could extend the important scenes over such a long period of time. The entire movie script should have been condensed into 30 minutes, it really was a short story with no defined beginning or ending. There are much, much better short stories out there from a writing perspective so, yes, I've just realized it was definitely the writing that was the weakest link in this production. The actors and director did the best they could with an average humdrum story."]},

In \"Waves,\" at least, stuff happens and not just in the opening and closing scenes. There was a consistent tone to it, too, with an exhausting emotionalism that was nonetheless appropriate to its tracking of teenagers. \"It Comes at Night,\" on the other hand, makes Lovecraftian horror out of a post-apocalyptic survival movie. The basis of the fear here is supposed to be in the unknown, but we know exactly what to fear: the viral outbreak and the consequential inhumanity of people towards one another. The grasping for tension here out of, say, a dog running away in the woods after some unseen creature, a teenage boy having the hots for an older woman, or the general distrust towards each other in an effort to protect themselves is feeble. Even the gross-out nightmares related to all of this doesn't help much. \"It Comes at Night\" is a pedestrian misfire.", "I don't understand why this movie was made.

Soon, they meet another family and take them in, but things take a turn when infection occurs and tension builds. I thought this could've been better and would be more of a supernatural flick.

Another thriller filmed in low to no light making it most frustrating if not impossible to see whatever is happening in many scenes; a little bit of this is to be expected in a horror/thriller/mystery but way overused in this film like so many others; it's a poor practice in my opinion. The story wasn't bad at all; however, the story and title are not cohesive; congruent, another frustration I have with the film.On the positive side, the performances were decent, it was suspenseful even though predictable way too often for me.

I'm about to give it the Gong Show gong. Then it becomes interesting and I'm all in.

Was Travis the central character? Who was dead and who was alive? It seemed Will really knew that guy Paul shot, but we never got an explanation on that. I'm not a big fan of creator directors who get all fancy with their endings and you're left with tons of questions.", "The movie has an amazing atmosphere and tone for the first and second act, but it felt like the movie was only beginning in it's last act.

The film has many interesting and great complex moments, but all at its own expense, by not being able to truly connect them to one another and proving to be more of a artsy and flimsy mess than connecting the unique plot points it brought up in the first place. As for the performances, they are for the most part rather good, with Joel Edgerton, Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Christopher Abbott being the biggest standouts. The script can be both convincing and messy, and ultimately confusing at times, with a lack of any true conclusion and or story to truly make the film worth standing out. In the end, It Comes at Night doesn't have a entire clue what it wants to be, but it is full of plenty of good moments and good performances for it to prove to be at least a mostly entertaining watch- especially for horror fans.\nMy Rating: 6.75/10"},

{"ratings": 8, "review_text": "(Rating as a movie) It Comes At Night is a very interesting film to say the least. A lot of these A24 films defy expectations perpetuated in their advertising in a way that frustrates the general audience, which makes it all the more tragic when good movies like this get trashed by people expecting something that it's not supposed to be. Did I think this movie was scary? At some points, yes. There was always a feeling in my gut that something wasn't right, despite the sense of security that the film was trying to create. That feeling was paranoia. This film portrays paranoia in a way that I'm not used to seeing in the modern horror genre, generating fear around things that the audience can't see. The cinematography is top notch, and the main characters were pretty likable for the most part. This film also has a lot of dark, tight corridors that really feel claustrophobic. The acting was really good, which made the characters pretty believable. I'd say my biggest criticisms are with the pacing of the characters. Characters team up and become best friends literally only hours after meeting one another. They could've easily fixed this by making it so that these two families were living side by side from the beginning, that way they wouldn't have to establish trust because they'd already have been in the picture prior to the events of the movie. I'm not going to be one of those people who gripes about nothing really coming at night, because I actually liked the whole concept of this invisible force ravaging this family, and the whole fear of the unknown, it's a lot more threatening than \"oh no! Zombies!\". I'll admit that this film is very slow burn, and if you're looking for an intense horror film from beginning to end, this is definitely not the film for you. I'm gonna give this one a 6/10. It's closer to a 7 than a 5."},

And Beyond Doomsday the only thing otherwise was some sort of virus, and they never did go into any sort of explanation as to how it was transmitted what it was how it was created, what was going on in the world at Large, it was like they were completely cut off from society! This movie completely lacked any sense grounding in reality because of this. Without at least touching days on society, you don't know if this is real or not. All in all this is a very uncomfortable movie watch.", "My boyfriend and I were looking for a new horror movie to watch and chose this one. The first 45 minutes or so is interesting and seems like it may be a good movie. The end of the movie is so unnecessary and makes the whole rest of the movie pointless. It never explains the \"sickness\" that everyone is dying from. Do not waste your time with this one!!!", "Moderately predictable, but good characters and performances. Some inconsistencies, but aren't there always. Not overly scary, but some good tense moments. The ending was bleak and a little disappointing. Still not sure specifically what comes at night.", "I was cautious due to some of the bad reviews, but this is a good movie. It's suspenseful scary not horror. It's similar to The Road.", "I was going to let this one go. A \"meh\" movie that was passable at best as a slow burn suspense film, but scrolling through Netflix I see it's tagged with \"Hidden Gem\". No, not at all. This is as generic as it gets in terms of family vs post-apocalyptic scenario: X. This one being some virus/disease or whatever. It's literally 90 minutes of two separate families not really trusting each other. That's it. There's nothing horror or supernatural about this movie. I would give it at least a couple stars in so far as the acting is pretty good, however look elsewhere if you'e in the mood for horror.", "This is the first review I've ever written in IMDB. I felt conned by the 6* rating this had. The only things I can say good about this movie are the acting and cinematography. But without a story there's no point. You will not get any answers as to what is going on. The way the \"contagion\" spread is through plot device. For a title that emphasizes something coming in the night, you'd expect something to come in the night. It doesn't. What a waste of an hour and a half.", "More of simple dialog driven thriller than a horror film. Has a few suspenseful scenes and most of the time it keeps you on the edge of your seat.", "This movie is extremely well done and Edgerton gives a great performance, but it is more of a human look on what drives you to do things and what fear does to a person. Would not consider this a monster movie or horror by any stretch. More of a psychological thriller. Good movie, but very misleading advertisement.", "Wow, starts out faced paced without knowing exactly what's going, then finishes in the most boring possible way where you don't care what is going on. What exactly comes at night? Maybe Netflix streamed the wrong movie", "Saw this in Netflix. It was the lamest movie I could imagine. While I don't mind focusing on interpersonal conflict and drama with a backdrop of the apocalypse, this movie did so in the worst way possible. I can't care about drama if the characters are not explored. At times I forgot about the existence of characters and some of the characters felt more like props because of their lack of interaction with just about anything.", "Also nothing is explained and any conflict feels like it's just happening so the plot can move along.", "Interesting, provocative, and at times frightening, but ultimately lacking in plot, completion, or any true satisfaction- It Comes At Night's biggest problems come when it tries to figure out what it is trying to convey. The film has many interesting and great complex moments, but all at its own expense, by not being able to truly connect them to one another and proving to be more of a artsy and flimsy mess than connecting the unique plot points it brought up in the first place. As for the performances, they are for the most part rather good, with Joel Edgerton, Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Christopher Abbott being the biggest standouts. The script can be both convincing and messy, and ultimately confusing at times, with a lack of any true conclusion and or story to truly make the film worth standing out. In the end, It Comes at Night doesn't have a entire clue what it wants to be, but it is full of plenty of good moments and good performances for it to prove to be at least a mostly entertaining watch- especially for horror fans.\nMy Rating: 6.75/10", "...however, it's too slow. I'm not an action, adventure, bang-bang shooter up film enthusiast. In fact, I desparately search for good story lines and character development, but this one is just slow, and a bit cliche. Actors did their jobs.", "There are so many other things they could be doing other than making ridiculous horrible movies like this, the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the cinematography, other than that this movie is below 0 stars, it's so bad.", "This is not a film with zombies or gore. It still beats most horrors from recent years. This is a movie about the monster of man, about what resides within us... ready to be unleashed when fear hits.", "The suspense is hidden in what we can't see. Out of the frame. In the dark. In symbols and dreams. We are forced to make our own guesses on what is actually going on. And don't expect answers. There's a disease out there - it scares the hell out of people. We don't get to know much more than that. The soundtrack is out of this world. Despite daylight scenes where not much is actually happening the music feeds us a notion that things are about to go south. And it does.", "If you like an easy follow plot dished up on a plate, with a conclusive ending or a clever twist, then this film has none of it. But it is good. It is scary. It is well worth a watch. Great performances from the whole cast. 92minutes flies by.", "Where nothing actually happens. It's slow and has lots of build up but it leads you to a bad ending. Don't even know why it's titled \"It Comes at Night\" unless half this film is missing and I just saw the first part of it. I also can't stand the acting of that one guy whose characters always act like they got dropped on the head as a baby or something. This movie is just really odd.", "If you've seen advertising for It Comes At Night, you might be tricked into thinking this is an \"afraid of the dark\" horror film. The title of the movie, posters, trailers, and promotional images all hint that this is a movie about fear of the dark and what lies within it.", "What you get instead is a drama about surviving a recent apocalyptic event that is making people sick. There's no resolution in this movie, and while it may be implied that there's something out there to be afraid of, it isn't the main focus of the movie, and that premise is quickly forgotten and replaced with a boring \"who's infected\" plague plot.", "Halfway through the film I started to think I was watching a different movie, and by the end I was left feeling like I wasted my time. The title and synopsis lure you in, and if you take the bait, you'll be left disappointed.", "The movie was very slow especially for the first half. But it did get more interesting in the second half, but then you're left with nothing but unanswered questions and confusion. I usually don't leave reviews for movies, but this one just doesn't deserve any more than a 1 star. What a waste of time. Probably shouldn't have watched this on Christmas Day. lol", "(Rating as a movie) It Comes At Night is a very interesting film to say the least. A lot of these A24 films defy expectations perpetuated in their advertising in a way that frustrates the general audience, which makes it all the more tragic when good movies like this get trashed by people expecting something that it's not supposed to be. Did I think this movie was scary? At some points, yes. There was always a feeling in my gut that something wasn't right, despite the sense of security that the film was trying to create. That feeling was paranoia. This film portrays paranoia in a way that I'm not used to seeing in the modern horror genre, generating fear around things that the audience can't see. The cinematography is top notch, and the main characters were pretty likable for the most part. This film also has a lot of dark, tight corridors that really feel claustrophobic. The acting was really good, which made the characters pretty believable. I'd say my biggest criticisms are with the pacing of the characters. Characters team up and become best friends literally only hours after meeting one another. They could've easily fixed this by making it so that these two families were living side by side from the beginning, that way they wouldn't have to establish trust because they'd already have been in the picture prior to the events of the movie. I'm not going to be one of those people who gripes about nothing really coming at night, because I actually liked the whole concept of this invisible force ravaging this family, and the whole fear of the unknown, it's a lot more threatening than \"oh no! Zombies!\". I'll admit that this film is very slow burn, and if you're looking for an intense horror film from beginning to end, this is definitely not the film for you. I'm gonna give this one a 6/10. It's closer to a 7 than a 5.", "Firstly, nothing ever came at night. The plot is confusing. Was there a plague? Are there zombies? Nobody knows. There was so much build up that it kept me interested and then it abruptly ends with no explanation on the assumptions you're left to make.", "I was very disappointed in this film, mostly due to the fact to SO much more could have been done here. The concept was great, the location cool and scary, but I just got lost and stayed lost through the entire film. The ending answered absolutely no questions and just left me with a completely confused look on my face. I don't normally review movies but I felt compelled to review this one. The actors did the best they could with what they had, but honestly it could have been done way better. There were so many opportunities to do something really scary but instead it just seemed the the scary parts were all contained in Travis' dreams...or were they dreams? Yeah - confusing, disappointing, and a waste of time in my opinion.", "It was cinematic, there was a story there. It just wasn't told well", "When the trailers were just being released for this movie, everyone and I included thought the \"it\" was going to be some sort of supernatural being that kills indiscriminately. In other words, it seemed like it was going to be like Bird Box or A Quiet Place, even though neither of those movies were made yet. When the truth came out that there's nothing supernatural about it, or there doesn't appear to be, then that inevitably left people annoyed which is why there are so many low ratings.", "However, I reckon this movie will stand the test of time better than Bird Box and even better than A Quiet Place. This movie I believe was shot with more auteur intent than either of those films, as the way Travis's lantern penetrates the thick darkness is an image that will stick with me.", "Sure, this movie is a slow burn, but at one hour and twenty five minutes there isn't a single wasted moment. Yeah, there are some questions left unanswered, but there isn't a single unanswered question that can't be potentially answered if one were to closely look at the film.", "I gave this film a 9 to offset the ill informed low reviews. It's still really about an 8. I believe the people who hated this film expected a cheap action thriller instead of the glorious post apocalyptic drama we got. For example, nearly every review says \"nothing comes at night\", but that is just not true. Something does come at night. It's just not what one would think.", "I found a lot of the low reviews to be childish. If you want to watch A Quiet Place, watch A Quiet Place. If you want to watch something more psychological but still as visceral, watch this film. In this landscape of reboot and remake after reboot and remake, this film delivers deep visceral original horror in under 90 minutes.", "OK: This film is different from many horror films you may know. There are few \"jump scares. There are no severed limbs. There is little blood.But the film succeeds in horrifying viewers because it does what horror is supposed to do-scare us.", "How does this film scare us? One way is the low key lighting. A time tested strategy and it works here. Why does it work? Because we-as viewers don't know and can't see what might be there.", "Secondly, this film scares us because we know that nothing is more scarey than human beings, particularly strangers that we might marginally trust and that trust seems violated.", "What else works: the pacing is slow which ratchets up our anxiety. There is little music to underscore how we SHOULD feel. The director uses lots of close shots which limits our vision field which also creates anxiety.", "I know some where disappointed. But give this film a chance to work for you and on you. Let it happen and you will be fine!", "I understand what the director was going for with this film. He was going for a psychological horror, and the movie performed decently, though not as well as some critics are raving, but the title, which I read came to the director early upon writing it as a metaphor meaning fear, paranoia, distrust...that's what comes at night..was a horrible decision.", "The title implies something of actual substance will arrive in the night, but nothing does. The movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where some unknown disease has ravaged the human race. Very little information is given in the movie was to about the origins of the virus, or how many people are left in the world. We are also left to guess at most of the symptoms and how long the virus takes to kill a person.", "I believe many directors like this feel less is more, that leaving questions unanswered makes their film more mysterious as thought provoking, but I feel it's a cheap way out of telling your audience you really haven't thought of the plot that well as a writer.", "The tension builds in the movie after a very long and slow build up, as the two families begin to worry over a situation where the door was left open. But the director decides never to explain it, only hinting that Travis' dreams or visions could perhaps have been a memory and maybe he left the door open. This honestly ruins the movie for me. I don't want to think about how it happened, I want to KNOW how it happened.", "This movie tries hard to be a think outside the box psychological thriller, but it fails flat due to a slow script and way too many unanswered questions.", "Good atmosphere, decent acting. Minimal background. Minimal point.\nIt thinks it's being clever, but it's too obvious. Trailers made me want to see it. Watch the trailers, they are more involved than the movie."]},

But then you start thinking about all the mistakes, all the issues, all the questions, all the \"plot-holes\" and everything. And you start reading theories online, discussions, and interviews with the makers. And then slowly the movie opens up to you with all its multiple layers, all its depth and all its miracles. And you realize there is much more to it, than what you thought in the first place.\nSure thing, the movie is far from the best dramas ever made. But I think it is most probably due to the senseless choice of genre. This movie is as far away from horrors as one could be, yet the director insists on forcing all the clich\u00e9s, all the boring suspenses, darkness and jump-scares down in your throught. And they do not add value to the story. They are admittedly secondary, merely the set to envelop the real story. But then why bothering to put purposeless cheap horror ingredients in a perfectly shaped drama soup? I believe if all the efforts of making the \"horror\" of this movie were, instead, converted back into the real focus, the drama of this film, it could have easily been one of the best drama pictures of the decade, with truly deep messages to humanity.

About seeing the ending coming, who cares?? Does every thriller need a twist ending? Every movie doesn't have to end like Usual Suspects and Sixth Sense.", "I don't mind an existential film that doesn't explain the heck out every action and reaction. \nThe intent here is great. It's not a traditional horror film, or rather, it's that film with all the horror taken out. \nThe nature of the apocalypse isn't explained because the apocalypse isn't the point. This film strips away all the detail about how and why and when a family of three end up holed up in a cabin in the woods trying to survive a thoroughly, swiftly, definitively lethal threat. All that's left is the desperation and struggle of a dysfunctional team trying to beat the odds. \nBut to enter a world where we aren't handed answers, where we're asked to simply feel the growing fear and dread we need to be truly immersed. We need to believe that the 'red door' truly is the borderline between safety and peril. \nFor me, none of the actors had the gravitas to carry off that kind of immersion. The direction, editing and score all worked well but the performances (and script) needed some heavier weight behind them. The development of friction between the characters was too slow, and then too fast with a resolution that felt rushed. \nAnd the devil in the details don't do the film any favours. That red door should loom large in the narrative. It should be iconic and awesome. They should be slaves to it. They talk it up. It stays closed. There's only one key. But it's apparently a key they never use, trusting a couple of bolt locks that'd be good for the chook shed but no so much for keeping the end of the world out. And the gas mask thing is maddening. Apparently this deadly virus can be avoided by sometimes wearing a gas mask inside...and sometimes outside. So in other words, just wear it whenever.\nI love where this film aimed. It should have been a tense, ratcheting up of fear and paranoia, but it really failed to find its groove for me. \nAs for what comes at night? Fear is what comes at night. It's that simple.", "This movie is so pointless, it's hard to say anything about it. It's one of those nihilistic movies whose purpose is just to annoy and anger the audience with meaningless tragedy. I don't mind the unanswered questions, but I do mind that there's no plot and no character development. Maybe the audience is supposed to imagine the movie has substance, like how you can see patterns in random chaos if you look hard enough.", "As far as the horror aspects are concerned, there was only one creepy scene.

Well thank God for pirates, I say. I'd pay NOT to have watched this.\nOh, and I love that I have to click to whether or not this contains spoilers. I don't care. You won't either. There's nothing to spoil. Nothing happens. Literally.", "The film looks okay and is well acted, but nothing really happens to constitute a film release.....even at just 92mins. I mean, nothing really happens and the tension and atmosphere isn't strong enough to compensate for this.", "From the opening scene nothing happens. This is by far the most boring movie I have ever watched I could not wait for it to finish. I'm not sure what was meant to come at night but Nothing happens in this move. I not only want my money back but my life during the torture of a movie. Looking below it asks if there are any spoilers in my review. I can say with out question there is nothing to spoil !!!", "This movie was reasonably good. If you want tons of zombies and stuff, sucking guts and boobs galore and mindless violence, don't watch this. It was a very good psychological thriller and kept my interest through the whole movie. It was reasonably violent at times, so I wouldn't let young ones watch it.", "First time ever I've felt compelled to add a film review.", "Can't understand the negative reviews. All I can surmise is that they wanted World War Z special effects or similar. ", "This film is bare bones. It's raw. Raw in a sense that it doesn't try to be something it's not. ", "It's a very enjoyable film that 100% doesn't deserve the absolutely awful reviews.", "Good acting with a decent cast, just a shame they forgot to make it interesting.", "The title is misleading. Nothing really comes at night of any sinister nature as such. Nothing sinister happens. Not a lot happens. Overall for a 5 million budget it's pretty unimpressive. No real content or direction. It's predictable and not hugely original. Nothing is properly explained, yet due to the lack of content it's not thought provoking either. It sounded intriguing but was overall a slow and unexciting watch.", "The only possible thing that could be coming at night is a better plot... this film disappoints on so many levels, no real questions are answered, and it crawls to a mediocre ending. There are small glimmers of tense hope during the forest scenes making the viewer question what is out there, and what has happened to the world but then slips back to a tired and testing storyline. This is a bleak and unforgiving film in a genre that offers better examples of the 'post-apocalyptic\" plot.", "This is probably the most boring movie ive ever seen. Seriously so many things in this movie that \"unexplained\". seems like it has no meaning at all. I understand the message from it but they are certainly fail to make it interesting to watch. Im sorry", "I want to preface this review by saying that I don't have a problem with horror movies that don't scare me. My general expectation is that if something is in the movie, then it has to 'work' and make a point. That's it.", "What we have here is definitely not a horror movie in the traditional sense of the word. It mostly consists of drama that is *enhanced* by horror. There is some frightening imagery, but no jump scares - thankfully. Sometimes intense music played during sequences that didn't contain any horror, which was confusing. Horror elements in general are very subdued here, the focus is on uneasing the audience as opposed to outright scaring it.", "Horror can be used to tell a story in a different way, from a different perspective, to hint at what the characters are feeling without explicitly showing it, and so on. The makers of the movie do this to great effect, but the core elements of the story are not very good, so the effort is wasted.", "The opening arc is actually done well, it sets up the world and the characters perfectly. We are shown how dire the situation is, and that it brings out the brutality in people. The general tone of the movie is rather grim.", "There were very few actors, and the sets were also few, bare, and claustrophobic. This instilled the feeling of isolation, further enhancing the horror aspect.", "About halfway through I started to get a feeling that something wasn't quite right, that something really bad was going to happen. As trite as that may have sounded, it actually goes in line with what I explained previously: it's what the characters are feeling. Unfortunately, plot development got slower and slower as the movie progressed, and when it finally reached the climax it turned out predictable and underwhelming.", "And then the credits rolled, leaving me confused and disappointed. It genuinely seemed as if I only watched half of the movie, since many of the critical plot points were not explained by the end. Some movies try to purposefully confuse the audience as a mean to unnerve it. Here it works on a basic level, but since the plot doesn't go anywhere, it actually makes the general impression worse. The drama aspect wasn't good enough to carry the entirety of the movie on its own. As a result, plot holes significantly detracted from the experience.", "Overall, the movie was definitely not boring to watch. In fact, I'd say it's pretty good, if only the buildup wasn't wasted by the lack of payoff. I can recommend this movie is you've got some time to kill, if you're interested in unconventional movies, or if you want to see what works and what doesn't in a movie. Otherwise - skip it.", "This movie was bad. It started off good, but then dragged on, kept teasing with lucid dream shots, but never went anywhere. When it ended, I thought it was a joke.", "What a letdown. I can't say it was a huge letdown because that would imply that I expected it to be great, but it is a let down which means I expected it to be decent.", "The movie starts with a family burying the grandfather who'd succumbed to and illness. Judging by how the family made sure to wear masks to do the job they were afraid of this illness and wanted to take every precaution. This contagion tale focuses solely on this family but then broadens its focus to include another family. It's a strange dynamic because two families are trying to coexist in a post-apocalyptic era in which distrust is far more common than trust. ", "That's the setup. Where do they take it from there? I'll answer that. Nowhere. This movie goes no-where. It was a total farce, a total bait and switch. Scary movies in general are pretty lousy (although I keep coming back) but at least most of them have a definite aim, a definite goal. This seemed to be aimless and goal-less. I waited for something to materialize that I could sink my teeth into. Even if it tasted bitter or sour at least it would be something of substance. This movie had no substance just appetizer after appetizer to keep you seated. In the end this movie offered nothing but a grand dead end.", "I went into this movie semi-blind: I read bits and pieces of critics' reviews and watched the teaser trailer. I was sold on the teaser trailer plus the rave reviews was icing on the cake. With that said, I unhinged my own expectations as I had a feeling that this movie was going to be more of a mood-piece as opposed to another monster movie. I'm so glad it didn't go in the direction of monsters. In regards to the polarization this movie caused with its viewers, I am a little confused as to why people thought this movie implied the presence of zombies in its trailers. The movie obviously implies a 'plague': a virus so contagious that survivors must do everything they can to protect themselves from any potential carriers. The theme of fear and paranoia are expertly interpreted with eerie visuals, sounds, and a stellar performance by every actor in the film. We have all been in situations where we were apprehensive about the presence of certain people. It Comes at Night takes that idea and amplifies it to levels that certifies it to be labelled as horror. When the film ends, there is a horror that's felt; not one of being startled, but one of realization. The paranoia and fear that you carry is brought to light and the reasons are more sobering and grounding than what had been stirring in your imagination; arguably making them even more horrifying. Disheartening, bleak and tense.", "I'm going to put about as much effort into this review as they put into the story line of this movie, not much! I just lost 1.5 hours of my life I will never get back! I think I would rather sit in silence then watch this movie again. Not a horror, poor drama maybe, poor ending, nothing explained at all, at any time during the movie. Just don't do it, don't watch this movie, go for a walk do anything else.", "I got sucked in by the title but I don't know what it has to do with the film. Expecting something evil haunting the woods? Psycho killers? Supernatural whatnots, but nothing. Nada. Zip. ", "The storyline was the run of the mill mass illness wipes out population saga, but the addition of the other characters and continuation of the story has absolutely no connection to the title whatsoever. If you're looking for horror - don't waste your time.", "What comes at night? WHAT????", "This is one of my favorite films from 2017, though judging by its rating I can see that quite a lot of people would not understand why. I completely get why it has been so polarizing, with one of the largest reasons being its incredibly misleading marketing.", "This is NOT a standard modern horror film \u00e0 la \"The Conjuring,\" \"Sinister,\" or \"Insidious.\" This movie is slower than your typical horror or thriller, though not to say that it is boring by any measure. I think your experience of this film will be at least partially influenced by the expectations you have when watching it. Even though I tend to think of this movie as more of a psychological drama/thriller, it has many horror elements and I think if you can appreciate slow-burn horror films like \"Rosemary's Baby,\" \"The VVitch,\" and \"It Follows\" then I'd say you should definitely check this one out.", "This film plays as a very creepy character study that explores themes of paranoia and perspective in a morally ambiguous way. You will walk away from this movie after it's over, but your experience with it will not end for several days after watching it."]},

In an age of remakes, sequels and franchises it completely irritates me when people can't appreciate good cinema just because it's ambiguous and isn't constantly spoon feeding you everything. This was absolutely outstanding. Right from the starting scene, which has enough horrible imagery for any other film, I was transfixed. My eyes did not leave that screen. This thematic piece of cinema is extremely subtle, it's ambiguous and contains hardly any exposition. The themes of the afterlife, family and death in itself are well explored; I could analyse this all day! The plot of a family surviving a global pandemic of some sort, is fuelled on paranoia. The constant shift in the narrative from being able to trust someone to then completely reverse and grow suspicious of them, it's so realistic! We hold on to every word that these characters say because of how crucial one lie consequently could result in life or death. Again, subtle performances all round where Joel Edgerton yet again shines and plays the most cautious father ever. Very precocious yet is able to convey a loving sentiment beneath the emotionless exterior. He has that authority, if he says \"don't go outside\" my God listen to the man and don't go outside! But then are his motives always clear? That's the beauty of the narrative! Incredibly directed as well, the camera constantly moves at a slow pace to create the tension. The lighting is appropriately atmospheric, particularly as the son wanders around the house holding a lantern. His dream sequences are also unnerving, some seriously creepy imagery. Some may say this is too slow, but it's intentional in order to create the dark mood and for our characters to be fleshed out. It was just hypnotising cinema and, I have no doubt, it deserves the second perfect rating of the year.", "In the end I felt like I wasted another couple hours on another movie that tries to be dark. Just dark. I don't get this trend but it is out there. This one did not do it for me at all. I'm going to cut this short and repeat: This movie is depressing - find another. Acting okay and some style points (deliberately keeping it dark -- no sunshine whatsoever)but overall not worth investing the time unless you want to feel lousy about a dismal future.", "I do not believe that I managed to see this movie... one of the worst movies. Absolutely nothing... No scenario No explanations Nothing. Still waiting to see what it comes at night. A movie that have no scenario and and try with poor dialogues to fill the time up to 90 minutes.", "After reading the reviews I was moved to say something positive as I loved this film! The tension and acting was very good, and the story was one with which many people could identify with - how you would feel and act in a similar situation. It's a horror film because of the subject but doesn't contain any hardcore content. I was gripped throughout and can highly recommend this to any horror and drama fans.", "I will admit this film is not what I had expected from the previews. But that's what makes this film a gem. It's not your typical horror or thriller film. It is done in such a way that only the essential information is given, but by doing so it still creates this incredible tension and suspense. I think this is one reason his film has gotten unsavory reviews. Some viewers will want questions to be answered. Once you accept that this film is about what happens in the house not outside of it, you may enjoy the simplicity of this film. Some even have issues with the title and critic the fact that they think nothing comes at night. It's not true...nightmares, fear, bad events...those all come at night. Anywho... I enjoyed this film. It was shot well, the score was excellent and so was the acting. Don't expect monsters and tons of gore or jump scares. This movie is all about the art of subtlety.", "The movie is not really a zombie movie, but runs in the same vein. The characters, the story, and the setting of the film are all too similar to so many movies before it. That does NOT mean it isn't worth watching, because it is.", "I particularly enjoyed the slow-paced, tense dramatic scenes. It fits the story well; each scene manages to shed some light into what each character is feeling at that moment. The music was well done and helped add to the suspense.", "The characters are thrown into a position where the audience is constantly asking itself, what would I do? What is the choice I would make? It is not hard to empathize with all the characters, because each character has a relevant side and position to consider. The first hour of the film is setting up for the last 30 minutes, when the most tension and suspense is displayed followed by a conclusion that leaves you wondering.", "One thing I kept asking myself is, what comes at night? There was obviously no monsters or villains that came at night in the movie although the title implies it. I think perhaps what comes at night is the sickness described throughout the movie. Perhaps it manifests at night. The other conclusion I considered was perhaps regret, or grief, and the characters experience these emotions most keenly in the twilight hours when all should be calm.", "No matter what conclusion you come to, you won't regret watching this film.", "First off the title of this movie is very misleading. The first thing I said after watching this was, \"So what comes at night??\" I will tell you now, nothing comes at night.There were so many questions left unanswered. We are lead to believe that the guy they let into the house is lying about not knowing there was anyone in the home and by saying he was with his brother when later he reveals that he is an only child. Do we ever find out if he was really lying? Is he a bad guy? Who knows!! Why were they all supposed to wear gas masks but then are all outside chopping wood without them? Not very consistent. Who was the dog barking at? Who brought the dog back in the house? Who unlocked the red door? How did the little boy get sick? The most annoying part for me is that we watched this on our firestick and had to keep waiting for it to reboot. Waisted so much time trying to watch a movie that has no freaking point!", "I really don't get why people would make movies like this, for a solid hour you are bored out of your mind hoping that something will happen, and then. It never does! Perfectly wasted 90min of my life. I cannot believe the reviews of the critics praising this movie, did they even watch it or someone paid them to do it!", "If you want to waste your 90 minutes of your life, do not read this review, just go and see this movie. If your 90 minutes of your life is valuable for you avoid this movie.", "This writer and director Trey Edward Shults should die next year, this way he can not continue making such empty movies and make people waste their precious minutes and money.", "These Animal Kingdom and A24 film companies fool the audience with the trailer and movie poster. When you watch the trailer you think it is a cool horror movie but unfortunately it is not even close. But there are a lot of irrelevant dialogues, no explanation for anything, no details and there is no It. All you get is dark woods, some noises and a boy's meaningless dreams. Even the dreams of the boy scarier than the movie itself. There a lot of unexplained and unanswered questions and events. Obviously, stupid writer of the film could end it in 20 minutes but instead he extends the time of the movie with silly conversations, silly dreams, silly sounds and silly images so he can glorify himself: \"Oh, I made a movie. Now, I can go and suck my boyfriend's member.\" I even can not believe how Joel Edgerton is part of this mess.", "Overall, this is an empty movie. As audience you expect something to happen in the movie but you never get what the trailer offers. This is a kind of movie that, director and product companies set a trap to get your money. Do not fall into their trap. If you do, they get rich and you will feel stupid.", "Last advice: Avoid this rubbish.", "I never planned on writing a review about any movie(I am to lazy to do so), but I decided it was worth it, so that I could help others not to waste 2 hours of their life watching the worst movie ever made. First of all the trailer is very misleading and *spoiler* nothing comes at night(only boredom from watching the movie). Its a movie where nothing happens, nothing is explained, it has no beginning or end or even a plot. It has no special effects(its a 5 million dollar movie, supposedly), it has no suspense, it has no story, it has nothing special about the way its directed. Its a movie that you have no reason to watch. I was watching it hopping that something would happen at some point, but guess what, NOTHING happened. Please for the love of god, don't watch it.", "It had a lot to be a great movie but everything its ruined by the night. What comes at night? Sleepy eyes. Terror? None. Suspense? Forget It? Action? Some... but they get tired very fast. Its a never ending of lost ends. We understand there some kind of disease spreading but than we get lost in a weird story telling. Nothing ever really comes at night. Booorinng!", "This film should never have been marketed as a horror which, I'm only assuming, is why it has had so many bad reviews. It is a post apocalyptic drama with some tense moments. Basically, nothing is really spelt out for you but it would seem some kind of disease has ravaged the country and the film is about two families trying to survive. I would say it's really a study in how, when the s**t hits the fan, humans revert back to their most basic instincts. Don't go into this expecting a lot to happen as it is very slow but in saying that, I felt compelled to see it through to the end and it was worth it if only for the acting. I would compare it to The Road in terms of pace and style."]},

Simply look through the review section and you will see what people actually think of it. It's not horror or entertaining, just boring.", "Avoid this movie.", "I would argue that we are living in the golden age of horror. In recent years, filmmakers have began to really understand what Alfred Hitchcock knew all along; \"There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.\" The Conjuring, It Follows, The Babadook, The Witch, Don't Breathe and most recently Get Out, are just some of today's horror films that have proved that just because a film is a horror film, it doesn't mean it has to be loaded with jump scares and have a poor quality overall. 2017 especially looks to be a very good year for horror fans, yes The Mummy wasn't good and Saw is set to return, but with Get Out being one of, if not THE best film of the year, as well as, the rave reviews Annabelle Creation has gotten, and the hype the new IT adaptation, this year is shaping up to be one of horror's finest.", "The most recent horror film to get the big thumbs up by critics is none other than It Comes At Night, the film has been praised for its bare bones story and fear of what isn't on screen, and has been considered, like Get Out, as one of 2017's best films\u0085. Everyone else however, begs to differ. What is perhaps most interesting about It Comes At Night is the drastic disagreement between critics and audiences and that the films marketing is said to be misleading. Having now seen It Comes At Night I can see both why people love, as well as, hate this film. It Comes At Night is a hard film to review and one I'm still not really sure how to feel about, but what I do know is that film is extremely well made, even if it mislead its audience and went for an preferred reading that is widely not taken and is a bit of a stretch.", "Firstly I'd like to address the argument that this film is falsely advertised, as this is where i believe a lot of the negative responses from audiences came from. Having seen the posters and the trailers, I completely understand why people will feel cheated and tricked when actually seeing It Comes At Night, as the film is not the one implied in its marketing. I attribute this to the fact Universal are involved with this film, and so have to market to attract an audience. Thus what is advertised is a mysteriously unnerving, Joel Edgerton starring, 'Don't-open-the-red-door-at night,-or the-unknown-night-monster-will-kill-you' movie. The film is not the same film that is advertised, but to be honest, I don't think Universal could've sold the film that It Comes At Night is, or at least not in a way resulting in successful box office returns. For me the big issue with the films mislead marketing is the films title. It Comes At Night is a cookie cutter horror movie name, that if you look back at every horror film ever, would allude to an unknown creature that comes out and kills at night\u0085 That is not the case with this title. Director Trey Edward Shults has stated that it is a metaphor, but no one really seems to know what metaphor that is. Is the 'it' in the title meant to be paranoia, fear and distrust of others? That's the only thing I can think that 'It' is. But then again IS 'It' an unknown creature that kills at night? Because, SPOILER ALERT, who killed the dog? And who brought the dog back to the house and opened the red door?", "This all being said, the film is well crafted even if it lies and teases the audience. The suspense was excellently crafted in this film as you are left to feel on edge for the films entire run time. Part of this suspense is due to the lack of answers, and so in a way that is successful in making you feel the suspense and paranoia of the characters. As well as the suspense, the theme of paranoia was explored brilliantly mainly due to the fact that it is the smallest details that characters question, such as; the door being open, Andrew sleepwalking, Andrew keeping his eyes closed, Will's brother etc. To an extent, the lack of answers helps fuel the paranoia, not only in the characters, but in us the audience. But it's only the little things and minor questions that work by being unanswered. Also, say what you will about the film, but the acting is definitely brilliant. The film's small cast do a great job and Joel Edgerton once again proves a brilliant actor, having shone as writer, director and actor with The Gift in 2015, Edgerton pulls off another great horror film performance, this time the exact opposite of the calm and calculated Gordo.", "To conclude, It Comes At Night is a confusing movie, one that is hard to put my finger on, but also one where I can see every person's argument. It's essentially the Blurred Lines music video (except not offensive), the director has stated that the text is one thing, while the audience collect evidence to say otherwise, rejecting and hating what the director has made. The films cookie cutter title and mysteriously gripping marketing clash with the directors overall goal and have left audiences disappointed in Trey Edward Shults because of this. This isn't Shults fault, however his efforts have not helped to extinguish the blaze of negative responses from the average movie goer. Marketing aside, It Comes At Night is a well crafted film, that excellently creates suspense and paranoia in the audience, unfortunately a bit too well for some audiences. The film offers far more than it delivers as it simply wants to be minimal, which I can appreciate, but it's just a shame that the marketing team did such a good job at the expense of Trey Edwards Shults vision.", "This film was very...", "... meh. I mean it wasn't a bad film. It had some great acting in it, but it felt very predictable. So yea, a walking dead, annabelle hybrid. The film is about a Dad trying to protect his wife and teenage son from what appears to be some sort of zombie apocolyspe. The first 20 mins of the film is basically them trying to cope thhough this apposed apocolyse. I don't want to give too much away without spoiling it, but I still felt 'The Girl with all the gifts' did the zombie genre justice than this film. It isn't really a zombie film. You don't see them, it is just they# way the film is built up, if that makes sense. Overall, if you like zomnbie and psychological horror films, you may ,ove this. But I hate zombie flicks. Just way too predicitble and bland.", "Good acting, good story, outstanding film techniques, good suspense...but what the hell, where is the climax, where is the \"IT\" so: what have I been waiting for. It feels like there will have to be a sequel because there was not enough time. I am all for well done arty movies but this does not feel arty enough to be one. It feels more like the director forgot all about the title (IT comes at night) and got lost in the drama.", "Well that was completely pointless. The trailers sell it as a paranoid mystery, but really it's just a drama of disconnected interactions set in a never-explained crisis. There's no reason to call the film by that title.", "Good cinematography and engaging score, tho.", "The acting was good, filming was done professionally, there was no real story, however, except futility. Nothing was explained about the \"disease\" that was \"out there\" and no reasons were given for the title of the movie. This was NOT A HORROR FILM, it was a film about fear and violence, none properly explained. No one had any redeeming qualities. There was initially friendship between two families caught in some \"vague\" danger, but it quickly broke down to hatred and murder. I suggest you don't waste your time and money on this one. Probably the worst movie I have seen this decade. It didn't follow any Hollywood film standards of a three act structure, had no hero, no bad guy, or any resolution. It did have tension at times, but it was hollow and proved artificial and ultimately meaningless. There was a real opportunity to turn the movie around toward the end, but the writer missed it completely, instead falling back on keeping the audience in total ignorance. Don't go unless you are a psychology student trying to impress a SJW professor.", "Some of the obvious things that come at night in this film are listed above. This film is a fantastic study of paranoia, isolation, and an utter lack of hope.", "It clearly went over quite a few heads, and that's okay. Some people need film to be constantly linear, with undeveloped characters taking one action after another in a drudging serialism until an ending is reached that answers all of their questions real tidy. If you are one of those, don't bother with this film, the next quarter billion dollar Avengers movie is just around the corner.", "However, if you can appreciate pacing, subtlety, and a filmmaker who respects you enough to allow you to dwell on the ending and maybe even come up with your own answers, dig in. This is a great movie for non-idiots.", "This is so filled metaphors and there is nothing I love more then a good metaphor! The red door being shown every time the boy closes his eyes! Telling us that at night when we close our eyes our dreams and our doubts and our paranoia can get to us! Then we become the monsters we think we are protecting our family from! Then we are only left with ourselves at the end and there is nothing easier then destroying yourself! I feel bad for people who can't reach down inside themselves and see something under the surface! If u want a mindless movie then watch transformers!!", "Let's be clear about it: this is not a straight horror movie. It is a movie that builds on mood and characters. Especially the former, because a lot of things will go on in your head. If you get into it (and the movie dares you too, so no pun intended), there is a lot to discover. There are a lot of metaphors, there are a lot of interpretations of certain things.", "And there is the superb acting. Even when a character does something that easily qualifies as \"stupid\" (and I would call that out in any other movie too), there are reasons behind the behaviour ... or you can think of some without the movie losing any of its touch or it powerful impact. This does not answer many questions, which may make it a no go for some viewers from the start. If you like a challenge though and a movie that is smart and scary and confident in what it portrays, this is a must watch! It was one of my highlights of 2017. Watch it and cherish the slow paced burning and all the revelations that come in hand ...", "It was not what I was expecting, enjoyed it though. The trailer, the posters hints something else. So I thought it could be a horror, but it was even a terror or a thriller flick. Well, there were a few occasions where it was edgy, though in the most of the film nothing really happened. Slow but not boring. A simple storyline, limited cast and a apocalyptic theme. Surely you would have seen hundreds of this kind, so when you watch it, you won't find anything new out of it. Then remains the question, is it any worth!", "I liked a simple take. Just like the film 'The Survivalist'. A small family living in an isolated place, but very precautious about any outside threat. The world is infected with an unknown disease and people are dying everywhere. Recently they had buried one of their family members. So they are not taking any chances with anyone. But now after a terrifying encounter, another family joins them and how things go on from there are the rest of the tale to tell us with a small twist.", "Well, you won't see Joel Edgerton doing a solo film often. But this was a different, because of a small budget and the kind of narration. He did good and so the rest his co-stars. Firstly, it was not a horror film. Then there were a few intentional scenes to scare the viewers, but it wasn't anywhere near to scary. I've watched the whole film and I still don't know what comes at night. Dreams? Nightmares? Looks that's what it implies. Other than that it is a drama film with a little thrill. It can be watched nothing more than once.", "6/10", "A movie that tells a lot without saying much and delivers a claustrophobic environment even when characters are outdoors.", "Right from the start the movie shows what it is all about. Killing the sick and burning their bodies while wearing gas masks. Sadness, panic and paranoia increase every minute. When an unexpected visitor appears things do not get any better and it leads to torture due to fear and an intention to protect loved ones. ", "Nightmares sequences are just as paranoid as reality. When finally reality seems to be toned down a bit for a little while, there are some laughs and tenderness between some characters, a lie can destroy hard earned confidence.", "In the end, unexplained events cause the nightmare to become real and violence finishes off innocents as well as the guilty. ", "A wonderfully directed film.", "!MINOR SPOILERS IN PARAGRAPH 3! To be honest this film is waaay better than the reviews got. This is a great psychogical thriller between 2 families and their safe haven from a plague that had ruined the world.", "Why did people hate this film? The trailer mislead even me to thinking this was a creature feature. In the reviews there are questions on what IT in It Comes At Night really is.", "How I see it, The IT in the title is the paranoia and fear caused by this newly developed black plague. This, through a series of nightmares, shows the main characters fear of whatever's happening beyond the house. This provides many scenes unexplained events in the dream and real world giving this film nightmare fuel.", "I give this a 7/10 for it's well crafted plot and storyline and it's acting. This truly deserves more credit.", "Those 1:31 hours of my life indeed went down the drain..", "Camera was Okay yet, no plot, you will feel you will get old before anything interesting happens in this movie, boring ", "I have been watching post-apocalyptic movies since I can remember and this is the WORST ONE EVER !", "With that Movie name, I was expecting something will happen, but since they never go out of the house at night, nothing happened indeed.", "Nothing can be connected in the story. How grandpa got sick? Why were Paul and Will attacked? By who? Why the red door opened while Paul has the only key? How the kid or the dog opens the door? How the disease spread? from the dog to the kid? from the kid to Travis?", "There are holes everywhere throughout the story, nothing exciting, slow. It is worse than a dumb zombie movie that you could have a stupid laugh.", "Even if you have loads of money, save your time on something else!", "I'd never written a review before, but this time I will because I can't understand why people rate this film so low. Maybe they were expecting a horror movie, with scare jumps and monsters or zombies, I'm not sure. However, this film goes beyond that. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) It's a normal family,trying to survive, and, even though we can't see the real disease (maybe that's why people hated this film so much) we can have an idea. The film is very well done, the acting, everything is on point. It has a lot of suspense, and some scary parts too. You should watch it, give it a try, but remember, don't expect ghosts, monsters, zombies or whatever... just enjoy being for a while in the real word, where you can't trust people anymore, and where you will do anything to survive.", "I'll start by saying what \"It Comes At Night\" does well: It creates a spooky atmosphere. Here's the problem, though: The film also has absolutely no context or base, rendering that atmosphere moot and any plot/character development non-existent.", "For a basic plot summary, this movie sees a husband (Joel Edgerton), wife (Carmen Ejogo), and son (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) living like hermits in their home that is all boarded up. They were gas masks, supposedly because of some sort of epidemic that is sweeping the nation. One day, another family (Christopher Abbott, Riley Keough, & Griffin Faulkner) shows up at their doorstep. The main family decides to harbor them...but will that turn out to be a good decision in the end?", "This was a very, very disappointing experience for me, especially considered A24's usual recipe for success. The main problem is that the movie explains nothing and has no context...not a good mix. It isn't \"about\" anything, and very little actually happens from start to finish. I've watched a lot of these types of films (especially ones recently made by A24 itself), and I can honestly say I have no idea what the goal of \"It Comes At Night\" was supposed to be. It doesn't really develop characters, you never really find out what is happening, and while the atmosphere can be a bit spooky, it doesn't really matter because the rest of the proceedings are such a mess.", "Bottom line: This is the first A24 film I think I've ever seen that I'd tell people to stay away from. Looks good, a bit spooky at times, but utterly pointless and nothing to remember from the experience."]},

This movie is completely mis-marketed because he knows the general audience doesn't care about his father and wouldn't want to watch a 90 minute complaint. For 90 minutes, it is another pretentious and clich\u00e9d drama with racist stereotypes all around. All the black people in this movie have the worst acting compared to the whites. Clearly, the director intentionally did that so he can start controversy about white power and whites being better than blacks. The movie ends abrupt with no questions answered. The truth is, this movie is about the illness of paranoia and what it leads to. The message that there is just bad and good in the world has been done over thousands of times in other movies. There is nothing original about this film, it just copy cats sources from other scripts. The direction was shoddy, especially the inconsistent lighting and continuity errors. At one point, the director forgot to even use the 180 degree rule. The cinematography was pretty bad. A lot of repetitive camera movement and every framed look like a bad student film.

This seems to be the main criticism from those who dislike it, but I think they are missing the point of what the film is actually about. In fact I think the film's lack of exploration of the disease itself is its greatest strength. Far from being some zombie pandemic horror film, 'It Comes at Night' is more interested in the tension that builds between the two central families as they struggle to survive each other, as well as the world they live in. The film is much more of an exploration of the internal ideas of fear, suspicion and paranoia, than a paranormal scream fest.

But, it was sold as a horror film. This thing is - at best - a thriller, and would be best classified as a drama. You keep waiting for that ominous threat out there to crest the top of the hill for the climax, but it literally never comes; it's barely even implied. And once you figure out the script's point of view, it's not really all that hard to see what the ending will be - I figured it out (much to my great disappointment) about 10 minutes into the film. About halfway through I was hoping that this is one of those films where all of the action and \"good stuff\" happens in the last twenty minutes. You know, one of those films where the monster is always offstage until the very end? Well...uh...nope. The monster is off stage, stays offstage, and was probably eating bon bons in it's dressing room throughout the entire film. I actually heard people in the theater complaining about the ending.

And it is not for exploration in depth, it is not for a new eye that examines in new ways and warrants the run-time. It is a rehash of everything I have ever seen, the standard conflict of trust vs survival, as surface as you can get.

There were moments of quiet that really set the atmosphere. While there were a few lulls, it was for the most part paced well. I will note, however, that part about the pacing is from my partner.

You know when the danger comes, wherever it comes from, that door is how it will get in.\u00a0", "I felt like this movie was set up to fail, though. From the misleading marketing of It Comes at Night, clear to the fact that it was only receiving extremely limited screenings at the theaters. Our local theaters only showed it once a day at 4:55 pm.

We had to arrange our schedule specially just to go see it!", "If you watch the trailer (or read the title) you will think that this is a horror movie but it really is at most a low-suspense thriller.

The script was a bit amateurish and just had nothing to grab the attention. The story line was a let down as it didn't have any cohesion to it and it was very weak.

So far it has been the most disappointing and boring movie of this year. I am being generous by rating it 2/10.

With this movie, Shults shows a lot of promise as a director. He has a strong command of the screen, and delivers on excellent visuals. However, I can't say the same for him as a writer. Most my problems with this movie do stem from the screenplay. Not every movie needs to explain everything that happens in it. I take issue with giant exposition dumps, such as in The Mummy. What fun is there in a film like Inception if every little thing is spelled out for you, not leaving any room to question or contemplate. But there is such a thing as explaining too little, and being elusive to a fault, which is what It Comes at Night does. It throws a whole bunch of stuff at you, and doesn't explain anything. It was so elusive that I had no idea what this was supposed to be at all. Shults has said he wants the audience to draw their own conclusions, but I'm not able to draw a conclusion on anything because there's nothing established to conclude.

As people who have hearts, we have the desire to love and help others, but the film shows us that during an apocalypse, any sense of morality is gone. There is no love or kindness. There is no sense of being a Good Samaritan. There is pure selfishness and feeling obligated to protect only yourself and your family. The sense of dread in this film was so phenomenal. The themes of guilt, isolation, and tension were so excellent.", "I cannot even explain how much this film means to me. The acting was extraordinary, the characters were believable (the most realistic I have ever seen in a horror film), the music was emotional, and the story was harrowing and depressing.

It refers to the family that occupies their home, it represents the terrible nightmares that the son was having, it represents the disease lurking at every corner. It does not have to represent a stupid zombie or monster, people,", "All in all, this film wants you to be smart and if you are able to do that, this may have had a deep emotional impact on you.

Very slow and methodical. I was actually pretty irritated about wasting my time on it, but then did a Youtube search and watched a couple videos dissecting the movie and its themes.

The isolated setting is used to good effect and the mistrust that exists between the families is a fairly solid base in terms of creating paranoia. Unfortunately, this is really where the praise for this film ends...", "I think it's fair to say that Shults does a much better job as a director than he does as a writer; not a lot is explained here and much of the dialogue is either uninteresting or does very little to drive anything forward. There is no explanation of how this plague began or how people get infected? What you're left with then is a bit of atmosphere, a bit of tension and paranoia, but nothing to glue everything together and with very little in the way of a story it does make it difficult to become involved with this film - it also doesn't help that the film feels a tad repetitive at times as well.", "Shults is a fairly new director and I can see some potential here; as I say some of the technical aspects are quite good and he also gets some good performances out of his actors. However, if he chooses to write and direct on his next project he could do with putting a bit more thought into his next script.", "I love the way this film builds paranoia, telling the story from the view of only the main characters, really emphasizing the lack of trust between the families, building the tension even higher. You only know as much as the main family does, and it really adds an extra layer of fear that most modern horror/thrillers fail to capture.", "Watched this with my Mrs. last night and thoroughly enjoyed it---tense, dark and kept us engaged throughout.

I didn't. Yet, you're surprised none of that was present here? Before you call this movie 'stupid,' just take a quick look in the mirror.

More importantly, it exposes the nature of human beings and their selfish machinations in a very real and probable setting. Looking forward to more from this director, Bravo.", "Literally the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have a knack for picking bad movies. Just wasted 2 hours of my life I will never get back.", "This is quite a heavy film, definitely not meant for pure entertainment purposes. I am still a bit perplexed by the title, but perhaps it is meant to conjure up a number of common superstitions of mythical things that come out at night (aliens, monsters, zombies, etc). I admit that I am pretty uneducated when it comes to art, so I had to do a quick bit of research about the paintings in the film mentioned by another reviewer (by the artist named Bruegel). A quick search reveals that, like many of his time, he was a humanist (but in a different sense from the current definition). But, it leads me to believe that the producers are trying to convey a humanist message through horror, making it kind of an artsy horror movie (being open to interpretation more than your average horror about a murderous bad guy, evil aliens / monsters, or supernatural phenomena). ", "Humanism today is a secular idea, which in simplest terms, is basically the Golden Rule. It also emphasizes rational thought and science over dogma and superstition - basically a moral philosophy not based on religion, but on reason. It's certainly done in a roundabout way, though, as there is no mention of religion in the movie, although the father does stress the importance of having rituals (eating together and staying busy). There are numerous examples of superstition, however. The dog barks and runs at something mysterious. They don't go out at night. They always stay in groups of two, even to the outdoor bathroom. We the viewer don't think much about this. After all, there is a mysterious illness and desperate people on the loose trying to survive. So, we think they are just being safe. ", "***Warning: Big time spoilers***", "As a pacifist, I found myself very critical of this movie from the beginning. Why must the father be killed, rather than allowed to die naturally? And in such a cruel way? Must they have wheeled him out to his grave before they executed him? Again, we can justify it in our minds without thinking too much. He is ill and they don't want to spread the infection. He is suffering, so they are killing him out of mercy. But, for me personally, I found the whole thing quite cruel, and was not at all on board with this plot. In the final horrifying scene, when the father murders the innocent woman and child, the morality is probably not an issue for most, I'm guessing. At that point, all would agree that his actions were immoral and unjustified, no matter the intention of protecting his family. Ultimately, the parents are still alive, but at a terrible cost. The son dies anyway. The question of morality over mortality is one that man has been grappling with since the beginning of our existence, and is the basis of all religion. It is what makes us human. At what moral cost are you willing to pay to keep you and / or your offspring alive? And, what is that line which we as a culture can agree is not mutually beneficial for society as a whole? At what point do we protect ourselves over humanity? These are the basic questions I believe this film was trying to address.", "A24 film production yet with another film, after Room, The Witch and A Ghost Story films which are the best films by A24 in my opinion, I have finally watched \"It Comes At Night\", after seeing and reading many reviews of the film on how it was misleading, how it looked different in the trailer and mainly I was a disappointed by the ratings and reviews on IMDb which is my main source where I see most of the film reviews from, but instead of all the negatives I was going to watch the film because I waited so long for it and I'm glad that I did !", "Mrblog review: This review comes from a guy who liked \"The Witch\" film which is was also made by A24 film production and I think the two films are kinda similar. \"It Comes At Night\" starts with a family in their house looking for safety with a spread of a Harmful disease with no cure for It, \"Paul\" the father \"Sarah\" the mother and \"Travis\" their son with his dog all are locking themselves in their house to stay away from the disease, when suddenly they hear someone trying to break into the house, they catch him later and tie him, the guy is \"Will\" and \"Paul\" asks him some questions of why he's here, he said that he wants to get water for his family but \"Paul\" was very carefull and very protected of his family.", "The cinematography of the film was really good with some good shots, the soundtrack I think were a very good fit for this film, it makes you concentrate more in the film and it was terrifying, there's not many scary scenes in the film which I think is the reason why many people didn't enjoy the film, actually I only remember one scene that really scared me. The performances were not great but very good for a horror film.", "Advantages: 1- The cinematography 2- The soundtrack Some scenes were really well made and it had a really special feeling to it and not only jump scares like most of horror films.", "Disadvantages: I really don't know what's the director thinking, there's really no problem with not showing \"IT\" or that thing the monster but the question is there actually a monster in the film or not !!!

First: the title. The title clearly makes it seem like it will be a straight horror/monster movie. 2: The trailer. The trailer makes it seem like a downright scary horror movie. 3: The first scene. In the opening scene we are shown a father and son having to kill a grandparent who is very clearly sick with some unknown disease.", "All these things together make one think the movie is going to be something it's not. The movie is in fact a drama played out over how to survive in a post apocalyptic world. Do you trust anyone? How much can you trust? How do you handle a situation. It's then given horror and thriller elements that go with it.", "While watching the movie I was upset by what it wasn't. Thinking about it after, I'm more OK with what it was, but it was still somewhat disappointing in its ambiguity.", "I can understand why people hate the movie and give low rating.

{"ratings": 10, "review_text": "The title and the genre classification of this movie are completely unrelated to its actual content. So much so that it is totally missing the correct audience for it. I sat tonight in a theatre full of people expecting horror and/or mystery and saw them start to get restless halfway in and crack out their phones out of boredom. This movie is about a family that has isolated themselves in a remote area to try and survive a bubonic plague like illness. They meet another survivor with a family and their humanity is tested as they decide whether to help him or protect themselves. It then explores their changing behavior as they think at first they have done the right thing, then later begin to doubt it. It's about how ordinary people behave in a claustrophobic, high stress environment. Violence is minimal, there are no monsters, the plague isn't anything supernatural, there is no psycho, nothing at all to warrant a horror category. There is also no mystery at all. Nothing unexplained happens and the story is linear and takes place over a few days. There is less than ten minutes of suspense in the entire movie. Once could argue it is a drama, but honestly that is stretching it as well. A study in the psychology of people under stress is what it is. It is extremely well acted. It is interesting, but it is completely mislabeled and misleading and the people that would actually love it are going to miss it."},

I am so tired of movies nowadays leaving everything up for interpretation. It's not art or mysterious or whatever else modern day horror buffs want to call it... it is complete and utter garbage. This movie was not scary. It was boring. A demon girl stabbing herself with a crucifix is scary...a burned man that comes to you in your dreams is scary.

I sat tonight in a theatre full of people expecting horror and/or mystery and saw them start to get restless halfway in and crack out their phones out of boredom. This movie is about a family that has isolated themselves in a remote area to try and survive a bubonic plague like illness. They meet another survivor with a family and their humanity is tested as they decide whether to help him or protect themselves. It then explores their changing behavior as they think at first they have done the right thing, then later begin to doubt it. It's about how ordinary people behave in a claustrophobic, high stress environment. Violence is minimal, there are no monsters, the plague isn't anything supernatural, there is no psycho, nothing at all to warrant a horror category. There is also no mystery at all. Nothing unexplained happens and the story is linear and takes place over a few days. There is less than ten minutes of suspense in the entire movie. Once could argue it is a drama, but honestly that is stretching it as well. A study in the psychology of people under stress is what it is. It is extremely well acted.

There is nothing to make the characters relatable to the audience in the dramaturgical sense. Therefore, their plight is moot. And none of them have any developmental arc because when nothing happens, nothing changes. ", "Plus, for the stylistic choices this movie made in avoiding conventional horror, there needed to be a strong underlying metaphor. There is not. Is it ultimately about race? Or sexuality? Animal rights? The socio-economic pratfalls in a post-Tito Yugoslavia? Nope. In fact, I can't tell you what the movie was trying to say about anything that The Walking Dead doesn't say on a weekly basis. Case in point: The Witch (2015) had a similarly stark atmosphere. But ultimately it was a story about feminist teenage rebellion. And Satan. This movie's sole purpose was to lead up to a baby being shot as a really cheap \"climax\".

I would also not recommend it cause it leaves you feeling depressed and sad.

I spent 2/3 of the movie's run time waiting for \"It\" to show up until I finally realized that it never would. So, this isn't the movie I thought it would be. Is that any reason to hate it? No, absolutely not. I have to judge the movie for what it is and what it is is a jumbled mess.", "The film takes place, as previously stated, on a post apocalyptic Earth where many people have been killed by a rapidly spreading disease. A father, a mother, and a son have taken shelter in an abandoned cabin in the woods to escape the chaos, but eventually, they're persuaded to invite another family into their home. Things start off well, but tensions begin to rise and everyone is left with the question of who to trust.", "One thing I have to say is that on a technical scale, this film is wonderful. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is amazing, and the pacing (for the most part) fits the movie nicely. It's clear that the writer and director, Trey Edward Schults, has immense talent and is putting so much effort into making this film. If I were just judging the craft of the movie, then I would give it a 10/10. ", "However, I must take the plot into account. This film's plot is really nothing new. Everything that happens is pretty much by the numbers for any post apocalyptic movie or TV show. As Doug Walker said, \"It's The Walking Dead without the walking dead.\" If I had known that this would be the movie's plot, I could probably tell you everything that happened before I even saw it. The family comes into the house, they start off friendly, then they don't trust each other, and bodies start dropping. We've seen this done a million times, and with the glowing reviews this movie has been getting you'd expect it to try something new but it never does.", "As I said before, the acting is good, but the characters are nothing special. There isn't anything really distinct about them. They're just people living in a house. But that's kind of what I expected for this film.", "A huge problem with this movie is the number of unanswered questions. Who left the door open? What injured the dog? What do Travis' nightmares mean? Was he dreaming at the end? Who were those guys who attacked Paul and Will? Why did they attack Paul and Will? Is Will's brother dead? If so, then why would he lie? Why was Andrew in a different room? Did he open the door? Why is this movie called It Comes At Night when there is no It? Many important questions are brought up during the film and none of them are answered. It's fine to leave some things ambiguous to the audience, but it seemed like these questions were building up to something that never happened.", "One scene that really bothers me is when Will and his family are killed. Not because of how disturbing it is, but the amount of things that just don't make sense. First off, the filmmakers are trying to make it debatable as to whether Andrew is sick or not, when he clearly is. Why else would Will want to leave the house? And why does Paul opt for killing Will's family when they're pretty much already dead? He says he's afraid that they'll come back and steal from them, but they're going to die! Nothing they do will change that. But even when Travis reveals that if they're sick, then he's sick too, Paul doesn't even bat an eye. And guess what? Travis gets sick and everybody dies. The End. The ending is a convoluted mess only because they wanted to make it a really depressing ending, no matter how many problems it had.", "In conclusion, It Comes At Night is a wonderfully crafted film, but doesn't deliver in the sense of its plot. The characters are boring, the story is clich\u00e9, and it doesn't deliver what it's posters, trailers, and even the title promise.", "Keeps you riveted to your seat most of the time, but leads you to believe there is \"something\" out there; therefore, you keep waiting in anticipation. Believe me, there is no \"there, there.\" The ending is, well, there is no ending. Movie is truncated before it would otherwise end had someone put more thought into it. Poor editing, or poor directing, or poor script--maybe all of the above. Would NOT recommend this movie.", "this review doesn't really contain any spoilers, i just checked it to be safe.", "you know the urban legend/horror stories you hear of some guy who gets lucky with a girl than finds out that she's a tranny? Yeah, it was kind of like that at the end of this movie. I had big hope and dreams for this movie, but it went to hell very quickly at the end. I guess i might've had an inkling that it might happen from the director's first movie: Krisha. Just like in Krisha, the director has an eye for cinematography, and Kubrick- esque pan/zoom shots of horror but it ended aimlessly. And this movie had a nice scene or two that gets your hair standing(one is where a person was caught lying, another has to do with a dream) And it started out so well, there was a big storm coming behind us as we were just about to take off, thunder and lightning, and perhaps even a twister or two off in the distance perhaps? But in the end, just like in Krisha, it was much ado about nothing, no twists or turns, not even a bend, just a slightly curvy and bumpy road drive home to end another boring day. and then looking down to see that they actually messed up your order and gave you a whopper instead of the double whopper that you ordered. tsk, tsk, i had big high hopes and dreams for this director, i thought i saw me in him at one time, but it was all for naught, all for naught i say. ", "did you know: i saw parts of The Professional in a dollar cinema in 1994?", "I wish the earlier ratings were honest and true. First of all it was not a horror movie. Since IMDb is one of most trusted sources, people look at the reviews before making the decision to buy or not buy the tickets and watch or not watch the movie. This really takes away from the credibility of IMDb. I will never ever look at IMDb in the future. It was meant to be a joke, it was not funny. Lets get some things right, the movie was horrible. There was no point to it. The movie name had nothing to do with the movie or the senseless events in it. If the reviews and ratings were meant for cheating people, then rest assured, you succeeded. I wasted an hour and a half of my life. The money I paid for it is a different story all together. I think the earlier fraudulent reviews should be taken down and the movie should be flagged. Ridiculous.", "Went to see this tonight on its release date at our local cinema with the actors that are in it we expected so much more certain scene in the film should not of been so dramatic and over the top made me and my wife wanted to leave when this happened the ending was pathetic to say the least never found out what comes at night never find out what the whole story line other than them taking people in and helping them actually concludes you don't no if some of it is a vision or actually real in general was very disappointed", "This was perhaps of the most profound and disturbing horror movies I've seen. Even if you don't appreciate the loose ends (which were clearly deliberate), or how dismal it was (it became... VERY.. uncomfortable to watch) it was incredibly well acted and shot. Even if you disagree, I'd argue that it's definitely not a 'bad' movie. I'd never heard of it or the director but thought it seemed interesting. After watching it, I looked it up to see what people were saying because I was so impressed.", "And it IS horrific. It builds up some very intriguing and relatable characters and then tears them apart in front of your eyes. The loose ends make it even more unsettling, which might be part of what accounts for something this movie did very well: you felt like they were real people who you were along side, experiencing things as they would, without even the comfort of answers or understanding- so not as an observer, but as prey. It was also brimming with subtleties, which is a just plain smart story telling. It had an extremely modern, boundary pushing feel, yet nothing about it was hokey.", "One thing they did that might account for the bitter taste left in a lot of reviewer's mouths, was focus the story around people who turned out to be appallingly antagonistic, while the ones you liked and rooted for were more supportive. The one connecting character was the final tragedy. For the most part, you never saw the ones you wanted to see get what was coming to them while instead everyone you felt something for went down in flames. This is not common as it can be a turn off in terms of entertainment and, particularly in this instance, leave you feeling somewhat assaulted, unsatisfied, and stripped of your humanity.. it could in that sense be compared to movies like Funny Games, Hostile, or Irreversible, which in turn could be thought to cross a line that separates art from offense. This kind of harsh realism can come at the cost of stylistic expression as well, including comic relief and dramatics, which are fun and engaging aspects of great movies. But it was also interesting.", "I didn't have to dig for the reasons to like it, though. They only came in hindsight. While watching it, I was simply intrigued (albeit morbidly. If you don't like extremely dark movies, you certainly won't like this.)", "They come at night; no they don't.", "A film about an outbreak of an fatal disease.

Utter tripe.", "This is a fantastic movie to watch. The clues they place, the scenes it has, and many more features make this make this movie great. The story is very ominous in nature which adds to the scare factor. It makes the viewer already scared of what's going outside so when the paranoia sets in, that scare factor is shot up to a million. The nightmare aspect in this movie is very strong and made me jump a little. The characters are not that complex and simple enough to understand their purpose. The immersivness of this movie is also very strong and can suck you into a world also like the TV show \"The Walking Dead\". They're a lot of different elements that do make this feel like \"The Walking Dead\", such as a sickness, quarantine percautions, and other things like that. All in all, this is a great survival horror movie to watch. It's done amazingly well and I give this a 10/10.", "Finished the psychological horror film It Comes at Night. I was looking forward to this film and I must say I was not disappointed. This movie it's not for everyone. If you walk into it expecting a traditional horror film you will be very disappointed. The movies greatest strength is its ability to manipulate the viewers expectations. In many ways this film riffs off horror cliches and turns them upside down. ", "The movie was very well shot and directed! The post apocalyptic story had a simple set up, but worked well to slowly build suspense. Entire film you slowly wonder what is happening and what is to come. The film's main draw was it's depiction of psychological trauma and the extremes people will go to when civilization crumbles. This may not sound like traditional horror material, but the film constantly creates a feeling of dread that keeps you on the edge of your seat.", "The film is by no means a traditional horror film, but it brought up so many questions it demands multiple viewings.

It's just an average movie with a tiny bit of suspense but not that much to keep you really interested. The actors are not bad but they are not Oscars winners either.

{"ratings": 5, "review_text": "Let me start off by saying that I completely understand why this film got so much backlash & received the kind of negative reaction that it did upon release. I'm not the first reviewer to bring up the film's marketing & how It Comes At Night was promoted. Editing trailers is a dream job / passion of mine & I'd love to edit/cut a trailer for this film. The problem is how the studio sold this film. This is a film that was presented & made to look like a post apocalyptic monster horror/thriller that is actually a psychological drama/thriller that's an intense character study in human nature. This is a spoiler that I think most people that are viewing this piece for the first time will benefit from knowing; No, nothing comes at night. At least not physically. In reality, there is no monster. Nothing is out in the woods that wasn't there before this unexplained virus surfaces. What really DOES come at night is fear, nightmares, and paranoia. While pretty much every character experiences these psychological demons in some way, the male character are plagued by it the most. These are all good people who were good people before this apocalypse struck. They are people with families and who only want to protect their family and do what is right by then and what is necessary in order to survive. Everything falls apart when accusations are made, certain comments are read way into, and guns are pulled on one another that stuff really starts to go south. Despite the circumstances that our characters are facing aka the apocalypse and a deadly plague like virus everything and folds in an extremely grounded and realistic way there is nothing even remotely unrealistic about the film or what happens to the characters what we are seeing is exactly what would happen to any individual who found themselves in this situation so anybody who's looking to find scary monsters or outrageous action scenes of horror and violence this is not the movie for you even if it potentially was made to look like it was. the entire cast give gut-wrenching performances and the film is quite Bleak and end on a very dark and depressing tone. so if you want to watch a film that will unsettle you that has captivating performances and an amazing setting go watch this film just know that the only monsters in the film are human."},

The story is quite simple with not much or even no explanation why suddenly people are getting sick. So the mystery element in the movie will never be revealed and that's always a bummer. It's just an average movie with a tiny bit of suspense but not that much to keep you really interested. The actors are not bad but they are not Oscars winners either.

They try to save themselves from the deadly pathogen by isolating themselves, but one day a man comes through the door, causing much havoc in their lives.", "\"It Comes At Night\" is actually quite slow paced. It takes an hour for any real danger to kick in, and the build up is very slow. There is much walking around and chatting, and the characters do rather mundane things in the isolated house.

I'm not the first reviewer to bring up the film's marketing & how It Comes At Night was promoted. Editing trailers is a dream job / passion of mine & I'd love to edit/cut a trailer for this film. The problem is how the studio sold this film. This is a film that was presented & made to look like a post apocalyptic monster horror/thriller that is actually a psychological drama/thriller that's an intense character study in human nature. This is a spoiler that I think most people that are viewing this piece for the first time will benefit from knowing; No, nothing comes at night. At least not physically. In reality, there is no monster. Nothing is out in the woods that wasn't there before this unexplained virus surfaces. What really DOES come at night is fear, nightmares, and paranoia. While pretty much every character experiences these psychological demons in some way, the male character are plagued by it the most. These are all good people who were good people before this apocalypse struck. They are people with families and who only want to protect their family and do what is right by then and what is necessary in order to survive. Everything falls apart when accusations are made, certain comments are read way into, and guns are pulled on one another that stuff really starts to go south. Despite the circumstances that our characters are facing aka the apocalypse and a deadly plague like virus everything and folds in an extremely grounded and realistic way there is nothing even remotely unrealistic about the film or what happens to the characters what we are seeing is exactly what would happen to any individual who found themselves in this situation so anybody who's looking to find scary monsters or outrageous action scenes of horror and violence this is not the movie for you even if it potentially was made to look like it was. the entire cast give gut-wrenching performances and the film is quite Bleak and end on a very dark and depressing tone. so if you want to watch a film that will unsettle you that has captivating performances and an amazing setting go watch this film just know that the only monsters in the film are human.", "I watched a matin\u00e9e showing of this at a cinema in the middle of summer and it cast such a shadow over the day that it took the rest of the weekend to recover from it.

There is a real sense of the characters being torn by the need for survival and the futile boredom of being locked away in a shelter.", "The only downside to this film is the sense of inevitability. When life looks like it is going well you know you are only one sneeze away from things going to hell. This is standard to the genre but it felt a bit forced, like things didn't need to be as dramatic as they turn out. ", "I didn't really feel the sense of paranoia that is building in the shelter. I think it is because the main character is trying to act so logically that when things get irrational it doesn't sit straight.", "I think this s very good film that just didn't work for me. If you like small scale post apocalyptic films I would give this a shot.", "I'm not sure if the message of the film is nihilism or what. The characters don't grow or change, the struggles exploited in the film are left clinging to life by the end and you wonder what the director was really trying to say. If the purpose was to make you feel the hopelessness that the characters felt in their difficult situation, then fine, that's a great message. But the development of the characters is so lacking that in the end you actually don't get to experience that. They make poor choices and you don't understand why. The motives are very weakly executed. Fatal flaw. There is no intimacy with their actions, no empathy, at all. They are just strangers that you don't know. So while you are watching something with fantastic cinematography, tackling an important topic with touches on the darkest, furthest borders of human experience, you're left just watching it from the outside, not ever getting the sense of what the characters are feeling or thinking. There is no lesson. You don't learn from them. You don't want to because there is nothing special about them. It's like watching a stranger make mistakes but not caring because its none of your business. Except that in my opinion, a well crafted film should make you feel like it IS your business. I love the stark, hopeless theme, but it's poorly executed. Check out the Road if that's what you're looking for.", "Capitalising on our fear of the unknown & gradually escalating with a sense of eeriness, It Comes at Night is a gripping, suspenseful & brilliantly performed psychological horror that begins on a very promising note, makes effective use of its surroundings to create tension, yet doesn't leave a strong impression when the veil is finally lifted.", "The story mainly concerns a family of three who live a secluded life in the woods. One night, they find an intruder in their house and overpower & tie him up. On interrogation, they learn about his family and after much deliberation, decide to bring them into their home. Their arrival is welcomed at first but soon enough, paranoia & mistrust tears the two families apart.", "Written & directed by Trey Edward Shults, It Comes at Night is his sophomore effort after Krisha, and is a much improved picture. When it comes to establishing the mystery, creating a feeling of something sinister brewing outside & keeping the viewers in dark, Shults does an excellent job at these but there are also some creative choices that don't work out in the film's favour.", "The scares are mainly derived from what's left unseen, for those moments prey on the audience's primal instinct and brings them into the narrative but it doesn't reward such investment in the end, which is infuriating to an extent. Those hallucination sequences were more or less unnecessary to the plot as they don't contribute anything significant to the final outcome and only slows the story down.", "The remote location & isolated setting do help amplify the mysterious vibe, plus all of it is further enhanced by the smooth, smart & sharp operation of the camera. Editing is another highlight that gradually unfolds the narrative, and allows the atmosphere to set up naturally. Sound is utilised just as well while the brooding soundtrack adds more intensity whenever the occasion calls for it.", "Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbot, Riley Keough, Carmen Ejogo & Kelvin Harrison Jr., and all chip in with solid inputs. Edgerton, Ejogo & Harrison Jr. are convincing as a family and play their part expertly while Abbot & Keough are in as a desperate family seeking refuge and are no slouch in their given roles. The dynamic between the two families is what drives this tale, and Shults handles it well.", "On an overall scale, It Comes at Night is a dark, fascinating & unnerving example of psychological horror that's engaging from the get-go but fails to wrap things up on a satisfying note. Its ending may leave some viewers frustrated while others will accept it for what it is. Nevertheless, apart from that and a couple more shortcomings, It Comes at Night succeeds in keeping a solid grip on the viewers' attention for the majority portion of its runtime. Definitely worth a shot.", "*Spoiler alert*", "As many, many reviewers have noted, nothing scary actually comes at night, despite the title and trailers that suggest otherwise. So as a horror movie, this one is right up there with the original Blair Witch Project for being a complete let down.", "As a psychological thriller, it wasn't all that bad. It kept me on edge until the very end and left me with many unanswered questions. For example, were the teenage boy's dreams an indication that he was infected? If so, maybe the dreams are what came at night.", "And was the teenage boy was already infected when he touched the little boy? If so, he infected the little boy, rather than the other way around, which would be an interesting twist.", "The acting was very good all around. You really had a sense of this small isolated family struggling to balance self protection with the desire to connect with and help others. There was plenty of suspense throughout the flick. ", "If the title wasn't so misleading, I think people would have liked the movie better.", "Just to set things straight: a little bit of blood and a deadly virus don't mean that the the movie should be categorized as \"horror\". 'Cause this one is definitely not in the horror genre. Plus, the trailer is quite misleading.", "The only reason I rated the movie kinda positively - considering what I just watched - is Joel Edgerton's acting and because some at some points the direction actually made me believe that even in the last minute of the movie I'll understand what's that thing that comes at night.", "Well, for your info, nothing, no one, EVER came at night.", "\"What comes at night\"? Well nothing came at night, maybe the urge to switch off, roll in stinging nettles, testing if the live rail on the train tracks or letting some air out of your car Tyre and try blowing it up with my mouth. The film could have been condensed into less than 5 mins, credit to the director for managing somehow to fill the other 85 mins with waffle, dreams, in-consequent scenes while skilfully managing to miss relaying any back story and avoiding any character attachment and story-line. If boredom does not send you to sleep then you find yourself quickly wishing for the virus to kill everyone immediately so the film can end however it plods onto an inconclusive end that leave you all a WTF look that will bound you and all that watched with you for life. 5 million budgets on a wooded house in the woods, a pickup truck, 9 actors and a dog, 3 of which die early on along with the dog soon after. If the rest had died as quick then at least we would have been saved some time. :)", "The journey from the beginning to the middle of the story is a satisfying one. However the end doesn't exist, we're left with an unfinished movie and way too many unanswered questions. It seems writers/directors these days, confuse unfinished stories with intelligent writing, pushing the responsibility of connecting the dots to the viewers instead of the movie itself.", "This is not a Horror movie. The closest thing to scary is visuals from the son's nightmares. There is never an explanation for the plague-like sickness that everyone is so paranoid about and whatever the \"It\" was, is never explained and never comes at night or any other time of day that I could see. In view of its billing, the film was totally disappointing.", "This movie is, admittedly....slow. There is very little action, no zombies, very little blood and gore, and very little to the story.", "Yet I did watch the whole thing AND was interested thru-out AND enjoyed it. (The end was heartbreaking). Id like to give it 7.5 if I had that choice but went with an 8 since I do believe there is a fan base out there for this movie. We are just in a minority.", "I was impressed with the acting. It was so very natural. That in itself, could be another turn off for many movie goers. And I enjoyed the old fashioned darkness and shadows, eerie sounds, scary music and the ATMOSPHERE that was created!! I suppose it is a lost art and an even more of a lost art of appreciation for leaving things up to the imagination. I also enjoy movies with characters realistic. With the capability of both good/bad. ", "So yeah, I cant argue with the people who reviewed this movie badly and did not enjoy it....I understand why. I believe it is just the type of movie that a particular and perhaps older group could enjoy.", "On a side note, this story is sorta similar to a VERY VERY REEEEEAAAALLY (times a hundred), watered down version of another movie where human beings spiral out of control titled \"The Divide\" what \"It Comes At Night\" didn't provide, \"The Divide\" makes up for in spades. It doesn't hold back! It is a VRY dark and disturbing view of what we as humans are capable of in difficult situations.

We are not explicitly informed on the source of the terror, instead we're experience as the characters experience, we know as much as they know. This benefits the film, by placing us in the same situation as the characters.", "The music was very beneficial towards the atmosphere and development, conveying the emotion and gravity audibly.", "I don't have anything varied to state other than praise, so I'll simply state that every other aspect complemented the film, ensuring an emotional and tragic experience.", "If I had to list any problem I have with this film, that would be the response. If there's one film I've seen in my life where I can't for the life of me understand the criticism, that's for this film.", "SPOILERS BELOW", "People need to perceive the film for what it is, rather than the schlocky monster movie I anticipated from the title. By first glance, the title and poster definitely conveys that, although they're not misleading, in-context with the film the poster and title make perfect sense. The 'It' in 'It Comes at Night' refers to the conflict, much of the conflict in the film occurs at night. The 'It' also refers to the dreams, the dreams seem to predict the conflict. Characters in the film refer to one becoming ill as 'them coming', which could emphasize that Travis became ill from the dreams.", "Do you recognize how varied these potential meanings are? That's part of the intrigue with this film, the film's answers are very varied, they have multiple conclusions. They may be more than one, although there is a conclusion.", "My advice to those who don't understand the appeal of the film is to watch the film again.", "8.5/10", "8-", "Behind the mask of a survival flick lies even more, as this \"It comes at night\" is basically a visceral and accurate analysis of human nature. No one is safe in determined situations, and thin trust between individuals can easily leave space to paranoia and suspicion all of a sudden. We fear others will try to deceive us, steal our goods, kill us if necessary to survive, and this threat looks so real that it spreads like a disease. This \"disease\" relates a lot to the one shown in the movie, and for this reason the ending can be interpreted in two ways.It could be that the child was really sick, and so he infected Travis who then ended up infecting his parents, or maybe he just wasn't. He was crying, his parents decided it was not safe to stay there anymore ( the child crying would sound suspicious to the other family ), Travis and Travis' family misinterpreted the situation and ended up killing all of them. Then the disease spreading on their body meant nothing more that the blooming of their paranoia and distorted way of seeing things", "The trailer is totally misinterpreting! (the trailer clearly prepares you for a horror movie. This is not since there is no scary parts or something. NOTHING at all happens in this movie. So if you are for a horror movie you will waste your money If you are for a drama... you will also waste your money and time since this is a sum of RANDOM reactions from the characters. They react controversial and even though the movie spends so many time(almost all the movie) to present the characters in the end you don't seem to know anything about them. DO NOT listen to good reviews.. this movie delivers Nothing to yo", "You wonder what comes at night, right? NOTHING! No monster, no demon, nothing. Night in this movie is not more significant than the day. People are just sick for no reason, they don't say what causes it, why they are doing what they doing, whole movie is like this.

{"ratings": 1, "review_text": "This is the very first movie I've ever given a 1 star review to out of the hundreds of movies I've rated on IMDb. SPOILER: The director tried to pull off a \"make your own ending\" type of movie like Inception but failed miserably. You never find out what \"comes at night\" or if there even is any lurking evil. You never see any monsters, any plague, or anything at all to explain what this movie is even about. Sure, it can be fun to explore the human psych in desperate scenarios like they do in The Mist or Lost Boys but this film fails to give us an actual foundation to explore this psych. There is no plot, no antagonist, and an unsolved mystery.

{"text": ["This is the very first movie I've ever given a 1 star review to out of the hundreds of movies I've rated on IMDb. SPOILER: The director tried to pull off a \"make your own ending\" type of movie like Inception but failed miserably. You never find out what \"comes at night\" or if there even is any lurking evil. You never see any monsters, any plague, or anything at all to explain what this movie is even about. Sure, it can be fun to explore the human psych in desperate scenarios like they do in The Mist or Lost Boys but this film fails to give us an actual foundation to explore this psych. There is no plot, no antagonist, and an unsolved mystery. Leaving an opened ending is fun but making a movie with half a story and dragging it out over two hours is meaningless, especially when there isn't a single scary scene in a \"horror\" movie. Acting was great but no actor could have saved this failure.", "Had high hopes for this movie. Not horror. Not even a good thriller. Just insulting to anyone with a shred of intelligence. Human connection leads to trusting relationships. And this movie wants you to believe that trust can't happen, even when more than enough proof to the contrary has occurred. Perhaps the \"horror\" (really just disappointing) was the discovery (spoiler!!) that some paranoid assholes just can't trust, even when more than ample demonstration has been made that trust is warranted and indeed--- deserved. What a horrible film about human frailties, when frailty in this case is completely and utterly unbelievable. Waste of time.", "This movie was so bad I had to come and register on IMDb as soon as I finished watching it just to warn people. I've never really been salty about a movie before and I've never written a bad review before about anything.

Just my honest opinion, please don't waste your time watching.", "The film was absolutely awful.

His son is shown to have some seriously deranged but not entirely unexpected dreams and participates in voyeuristic tendencies. A guy breaks into their house and they beat the hell out of him and tie him to a tree, three days later they go pick up his family to move in. Inevitably this doesn't work out, the dog gets messed up by something, which is unspecified, and then conveniently brought back to the house for the family to find. In the end, everybody dies due to either infection or gunshot. ", "The fact I can accurately relate the entire plot with such a vague write-up should be sign enough that the writer didn't want to put in the work of an actual story. The excuse he wanted everybody to interpret the film differently and fill in the gaps with their experiences is ridiculous as 99% of the hipsters positively rating the film find the hardest thing in life is opening their organic, all natural, vegan friendly, non-gmo, 0 fat tofu frappe without exerting more effort than absolutely necessary. The false marketing was also tasteless and was sadly done better by the more recent movie Mother!, which actually had a plot, leaves room for interpretation, and even closed up all the nagging little questions one may have all on it's own without a poor excuse of basically \"imagine your own movie plot and call it mine\".", "I just saw that movie and then i found that, it was just a waste of time watching it.

So, in front of everyone, the protagonist shoots the father in the back for trying to protect his family, then the baby in front of the mother, then kills the mother while shes screaming over her dead baby and husband.. The movie fades out with the protagonist crying into his crazy beard next to the one person he has left in the world, a wife who is too passive for her own good. He's not crying because he just slaughtered a family without even blinking, he's crying because he's about to kill his step-son while the wife (the kid's mother) says nothing.

We never know or learn whether there are monsters, aliens, terrorists or just one sick raccoon (to be clear there is not a raccoon that we know of or anything else). There isn't even a hint. In fact, the one time they broach the subject near the beginning \"Did you see anything?\" the main character asks and the other guy says no. Alrighty then. We never know and never find out. We learn for some reason that one guy seemed to be lying about having a brother. Maybe that is the plot. We never find out why he lied and its just bizarre but in a stupid way not creepy.

I've been trying for hours now after the movie ended to come to a conclusion on what the purpose of this movie is, but there just isn't any. Things just happened without anything REALLY happening. Things went down, things went down, and it felt like we didn't move forward in the story at all and then that's it. The movies ends.

They reach back at least as far back as Oboler's FIVE and Corman's THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED, and then on to ON THE BEACH, THE DAY AFTER and up to the recent 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE and TV's The Walking Dead. It's decently acted and some suspense is built, but, in the end, it contributes nothing new to the sub-genre and wastes the good cast with a negligible payoff. Odd too, that for a movie set in modern times, there is no attempt to show an outside world, nor any visible effort by our characters to use technology to get info. Even in the Corman cheapie, there was at least a radio. Now in a world with smart phones and all kinds of non-electric gadgets we are to believe that the entire planet has been silenced all at once except for our core characters? As with his overpraised debut movie KRISHA, Writer-Director Trey Shults seems more interested in stringing together a bunch of bravura scenes, than telling a complete story. At least KRISHA had a scene-chewing lead performance by Krisha Fairchild to galvanize the proceedings; Here the cast are left to competently, but, glumly, get on with the business. "},

One might be tempted to say that IT COMES AT NIGHT is a post-apocalyptic drama with all the good parts cut out, especially during a time where you can flick on a TV or internet connection and tune into a Walking Dead (not to mention all the far superior films on the subject). Perhaps the most interesting thing about the release of IT is the disconnect between Critics and Audiences. Inexplicably, IT has (as of this writing) an 88% Positive score on Rotten Tomatoes among their Top Critics. On the more level-headed Metacritic it still has a very good 79 (higher than WONDER WOMAN!). Yet, on Cinemascore, audiences gave it a dreadful \"D\". The box office was also weak, and will almost certainly crater as the wretched word of mouth spreads. I'm usually one to side with the critics, but, audiences have it right this time. It sounds like a case where too many critics have been wowed by Shults' tricks and 'potential' (as they were with KRISHA)."},

Movie is intense. Atmosphere is brilliant. Sure movie leaves you with some questions, but this is what director wanted from people, to figure out some things themselves, which makes this movie more interesting. If you want good, psychological thriller movie, don't hesitate and watch it. But if you're expecting from it something like \"28 Weeks Later\" or \"World War Z\", then don't bother with it.", "This movie was a total waste of time, nothing scary happens. What happened to society? Who knows. What comes in the dark? Who knows. There are no monsters or evil creatures to speak of, just a bunch of delusional bumps in the night.", "My theory, there was no doomsday and and the only few people in the movie (a cast of like 9 people, a dog, 6 chickens and supposedly 2 goats we never see) are just a bunch of paranoid preppers who are hiding in the woods drinking their own pee and pulling guns on each other.", "There is some sort of mild \"sickness\" that is probably treatable in this new thing called a hospital. But it's never understood what the sickness is or what happens to those afflicted because the very minute someone is thought to be \"sick\", they are shot in the head and burned with gasoline by the protagonist.", "At the end, we're led to believe that the \"protagonist\" is totally justified in the heartless murder of the family who just wanted help because they are suspected to be \"sick\" but showed no signs. What did the family really do wrong? They just wanted to leave after they realize the protagonist is crazy in the coconut. So, in front of everyone, the protagonist shoots the father in the back for trying to protect his family, then the baby in front of the mother, then kills the mother while shes screaming over her dead baby and husband.. The movie fades out with the protagonist crying into his crazy beard next to the one person he has left in the world, a wife who is too passive for her own good. He's not crying because he just slaughtered a family without even blinking, he's crying because he's about to kill his step-son while the wife (the kid's mother) says nothing. He probably kills her too after she exhibits a sniffle from cutting onions. Some hero.", "Why the hell are critics giving this movie such a high score? I'm reading USER reviews from now on, they're like night and day compared to the critics'.", "After watching this movie, I feel like I've been pranked. HAHA very funny, you tricked me into wasting 90 minutes of my life. Good job.", "However, if this movie has one message it's that if you have a gun you are always right no matter how crazy you are.", "If the title and the trailer didn't make it appear like something would \"come at night\", this film would be worth a 6 for being artfully suspenseful with decent acting.", "It could have been so much more. The viewers could have been given at least a little of what they expected. But no... viewers were made to believe that it was going to a mystery horror, just to be smacked in the face by a drama instead. ", "This angered me so much so that I was tempted to give it a 1 star too, but to be fair, this would have been great as the first 2 episodes of a series. It did build up plenty of suspense, but all the build-ups led to nowhere: Who murdered the dog? Who were those guys shooting at them? Why was the boy in Travis's grandpa's room? Who opened the door?", "It baffles me why someone would write a script which aim is to apparently mislead the viewers all the way till the end...", "The movie had a great cast and it was written very well. However my family and I left the theater disappointed. I get what they were going for with regards to the unknown or the unseen sometimes being more scary than what you see and know, but in the end I felt the movie was just missing something to make it actually entertaining. The best way I can describe it is that you will be tense for about 90 minutes or so waiting for something to happen that never really occurs.", "The movie has almost nothing except: Dark Shadowy scenes, violence and no climax. 'NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL, NOTHING COMES AT NIGHT...!' There are no Government notifications about the virus breakouts. Nothing about any origins of the virus. The end is very disheartening.", "Guess what?!? Don't watch it. Save your time.", "Bad title. Interesting concept that leads nowhere. There is no imagery to decipher, it's just a bad movie and waste of 90 minutes. There is very little suspense. There is zero horror. Nothing comes out at night but dream sequences. The cinematography and soundtrack are worth mentioning as above average, but 1 star is all this deserves.", "This reminds me of the movie The Happening with Mark Wahlberg where nothing happens although It Comes at Night makes that movie look exciting. Spoiler: Nothing Comes at Night! I'm not sure why it's even called that. We learn essentially nothing about the characters, not much interesting dialog, there isn't a plot, we don't know what they're afraid of. We never know or learn whether there are monsters, aliens, terrorists or just one sick raccoon (to be clear there is not a raccoon that we know of or anything else). There isn't even a hint. In fact, the one time they broach the subject near the beginning \"Did you see anything?\" the main character asks and the other guy says no. Alrighty then. We never know and never find out. We learn for some reason that one guy seemed to be lying about having a brother. Maybe that is the plot. We never find out why he lied and its just bizarre but in a stupid way not creepy. It really is just a poorly made movie. I could've made this movie with friends without a script. It's just people in a house 90% of the movie and a dog gets sick but we don't know how or why it mattered.", "My feelings about this movie is very blend, but let me explain it without giving away any spoilers.", "First off, I will say that you should know that this is as much an apocalypse movie and psychological thriller as a horror movie. I do not think that the part of the ad campaign I had seen before watching the movie had made the apocalypse thing that clear to me. However, did this not affect any of my feelings about this movie as I love those genres as well \u2013 I just don't want anyone to go into this thinking it's something it's not.", "Visually the movie is STUNNING. The actors and characters are great. The scores and all the sounds were well played. Actually everything was really, really good until like, the last 15 minutes. Without giving anything away \u2013 of course \u2013 I will say that the movie really closes in on itself and in those last 15 minutes you just wait hopelessly for something meaningful to happen that will bring any reason for you to watch it, but it doesn't happen. I've been trying for hours now after the movie ended to come to a conclusion on what the purpose of this movie is, but there just isn't any. Things just happened without anything REALLY happening. Things went down, things went down, and it felt like we didn't move forward in the story at all and then that's it. The movies ends. It left you feel empty and disappointed, which is so sad because a proper ending could have made the overall movie amazing. So close to being there, yet so far away.", "Truly sad to say it, but I do not recommend it. At least don't waste the extra money to see it in the cinema if you're absolutely going to see it, because It Comes At Night does not have the payoff.", "IT COMES AT NIGHT is another in a long, long line of 'survivors struggling after an apocalypse' tales. They reach back at least as far back as Oboler's FIVE and Corman's THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED, and then on to ON THE BEACH, THE DAY AFTER and up to the recent 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE and TV's The Walking Dead. It's decently acted and some suspense is built, but, in the end, it contributes nothing new to the sub-genre and wastes the good cast with a negligible payoff. Odd too, that for a movie set in modern times, there is no attempt to show an outside world, nor any visible effort by our characters to use technology to get info. Even in the Corman cheapie, there was at least a radio. Now in a world with smart phones and all kinds of non-electric gadgets we are to believe that the entire planet has been silenced all at once except for our core characters? As with his overpraised debut movie KRISHA, Writer-Director Trey Shults seems more interested in stringing together a bunch of bravura scenes, than telling a complete story. At least KRISHA had a scene-chewing lead performance by Krisha Fairchild to galvanize the proceedings; Here the cast are left to competently, but, glumly, get on with the business. ", "With no explanation given as to what is going on, and with only the most minimal contact with anybody outside the 9 people in the cast (but, hey, there's a dog!), we are left to bide our time waiting for the minimalist drama to play out. One might be tempted to say that IT COMES AT NIGHT is a post-apocalyptic drama with all the good parts cut out, especially during a time where you can flick on a TV or internet connection and tune into a Walking Dead (not to mention all the far superior films on the subject). Perhaps the most interesting thing about the release of IT is the disconnect between Critics and Audiences. Inexplicably, IT has (as of this writing) an 88% Positive score on Rotten Tomatoes among their Top Critics. On the more level-headed Metacritic it still has a very good 79 (higher than WONDER WOMAN!). Yet, on Cinemascore, audiences gave it a dreadful \"D\". The box office was also weak, and will almost certainly crater as the wretched word of mouth spreads. I'm usually one to side with the critics, but, audiences have it right this time. It sounds like a case where too many critics have been wowed by Shults' tricks and 'potential' (as they were with KRISHA).", "IT COMES AT NIGHT isn't awful. As I noted, the acting is good and there is some drama, but with precious little else to recommend. You're much better off watching one of the dozens of earlier examples.", "The acting was good..., the rest is all negatives.", "What the hell happened, it was as if someone lost the last 15 pages of the script and said, that'll do.", "So many questions are left unanswered; where are they, how did it all come to start, is it a virus, what happens next, what's wrong with the kid, how did the kid get the way he is, it comes at night-what?????... And the list goes on and on.", "Were the produces trying to get the viewer to use their imaginations as to what happened before, during and after? If so, not watching the movie and simply thinking about it all would be it's equivalent.", "What comes at night; a virus with a curfew?!", "If anyone says its scary, punch them in the di?K.", "Avoid the 'nothing' coming at night.", "Had some promise and some buildup.. but in the end, nothing really happens. So not much to review.. Pass on this \"horror\" movie.", "Tons Money was spent to make this boring nonsensical travesty labeled as entertainment there are SO many plot holes that nothing makes any sense there is a virus in this movie and the rules are never explained so there is no point to it. things that are explained contradict each other saying that thing won't work but then we see that thing happen all the interesting stuff is all a Dream minus the pitiful jump scare we get at the start. I guess they figured showing and/or telling the plot is to much to be asked. I will be sure avoid this writer cause he simply has no idea what he is doing.", "One of the best horror movies I have ever seen\nJust watch it\n10/10", "1. 5 h ill never never get back of my life. Worst movie e I've ever watched. It's slow and nothing comes at night.", "Christopher Abbott is single handedly the WORST actor I have EVER witnessed. I swear I thought the whole movie was just a running of lines, no one in their right mind would believe his robotic pleas and fake story. The whole movie was a joke but Abbott's flat delivery and complete lack of emotion or human features just emphasized this to be nothing more than Hollywood's attempt to show how stupid they think the public really is.", "There are at least a dozen plot holes in this movie.", "One of my new favorite movies, this is cinema, this is art.", "Nothing happend in 99% of the movie. Only the End was good. I would not recommend this!", "90 minutes of nothing.\nWhat comes at night?\nWhat is even going on?\n90 minutes of nothing happening did not give an explanation to any of those questions.", "What a waste of time\nWhat a waste of time\nWhat a waste of time", "Nothing comes at night, nor at day. This is a terrible movie, no plot, no nothing. A complete crap.", "So dull, boring, uninteresting, weird, odd, boring again, bad bad movie!", "If it's apocalypse, you really shouldn't waste any food like they did in the beginning. A hint for screenwriters!", "One of the worst films I have seen for a long time. No tension, no horror and no story. Ive never known a 90 minute film drag so much.\nJust like in A Girls Walks Home Alone At Night the only character worth caring about was the pet.", "Nothing comes at night.\nThe door gets opened apparently by a sleep walking kid however everyone has forgetton the dad is the only one with a key.\nAnd did I mention nothing comes at night? And nothing they eventful happens in the film.", "Any 10 star review I am convinced is fake.", "An unnamed apocalyptic event forces two families to survive together in Trey Edward Shults' It Comes At Night. The rules are simple. The front door remains bolted shut. Only go outside in pairs. And never at night. Naturally, all three commandments are blatantly dismissed yet none of those transgressions lead to a building of a frightful drama.", "Beautifully shot with horrific claustrophobia, unfortunately the narrative is more snoozefest than thriller.", "It Comes At Night crawls at a zombie pace yet unlike the unstoppable undead there is no face to this fear and in this film's case, the imagined threat is lacking.", "Joel Edgerton stars as the father figure of a small family barricaded in a large house on a seemingly larger property. He slowly accepts Will (Christopher Abbott) and his equally-small family into the house in order for both to survive on their meager-yet-sustainable resources. As with any tight-knit thriller, paranoia grows as the threat outside encroaches. Yet neither truly happen. The perceived external threat is as solid as vaporware; the interior a masochistic misunderstanding that is more laughable than despondent.", "Shults has all the ingredients of a successful genre-breaker lined up in his editing suite. Tightly-wound characters. Internal and external threats. Fear of the unknown. And a cute dog. His photography is on-the-mark creepy and the Bernard Hermann-esque score by Brian McOmber is truly fitting. What got lost in the process was a moving script. The characters do nothing. The perceived threat is no more menacing than a New England garden party. And too many unanswered questions resulting in a shoulder shrug rather than a what's next zinger. More Lucy; Less The Thing.", "What comes at night? Perhaps the realization of mankind's fallacy with the reliance of late-night pizza delivery. Other than that, only Shults knows. And clearly he ain't telling."]},

Still, there were within certainly elements of promise for Shults's filmmaking future. \n \nPromise fulfilled. \"It Comes at Night\" deserves inclusion among the best films of the past year. Or any other.", "One of the biggest things I see with other reviews of this movies is that people seem upset that there is no payoff to the title of the film. The title It Comes At Night makes it seem almost as if there is some grand greater monster or enemy that comes in the night. In reality the title is about the creeping fear of paranoia that comes in the night and not some scary monsters or zombies or anything like that. This movie is very slow moving at times, it is an incredible slow burn about a family that is stuck in some kind of disease driven apocalypse. It is never expressed how it started, how it is transferred, or what it exactly does. This will either be something you like or hate, personally I love the feeling of putting us right in the story of the end of the world, in a world that already far beyond hope of saving.", "It Comes At Night isn't a movie about saving the world or being brought back from the brink of death, in fact it cements itself hard in the other direction. We never know anything about this virus or if there is a cute, we spend the movie with a family that is just trying to survive instead. Where other films in the genre might focus on hope and finding a cute It Comes At Night stands out as not trying to tell that story. Rather it focuses on the intense paranoia of a single family just doing their best. ", "I thought the performances were great, as it is a very slow character driven movie, the acting really is what holds everything together. You're able to relate and really understand this feeling of being anxious and paranoid, especially with the son. I appreciate that this movie doesn't sit down and explain every little thing to you, it shows you character through actions instead of just telling you. ", "Overall I would absolutely recommend this if you are looking for something with a tense, slow build. If you want a zombie or action flick with a monster, this is most likely not the choice for you.", "Horror movies more often than not are easily defined by having a monster that sets out to kill the protagonist of the movie. Whether it's ghosts, zombies, demons, murderers or simply a natural disaster. Often we know very little of these monsters - we don't know what they are, how they can exist, how they came here or why they want to kill us. We can't argue with them and seldomly can we escape. The reason we fear these things so much is because humans fear death itself. Death is intangible, unidentifiable and uncanny. We can't stop it, we can't argue with it and it lurks around every corner, threatening to consume us relentlessly.", "To me, that is what makes this movie so utterly horrifying. There IS a monster in this movie - we just can't see it. We know absolutely nothing about what is trying to kill this family. We don't know how to stop it, we don't know what it is, what it wants - we can't even see it! The disease seeps into the very foundation of their existance and neither we nor they even so much as notice, much like any other disease. It Comes At Night lures you in with a genre-typical theme, but then makes a diversion by making a controversial, trope-breaking and honestly refreshing take on horror. ", "In modern horror cinema, we have been conditioned into expecting shocks, sudden jumps and overstimulation of the senses. They are like roller coasters, filling us with adrenaline and huge rushes of emotion. But in reality, it's not really the pit fall of the roller coaster that truly comes to terrify us in the night. It's the knowledge of our own mortality and fragility. ", "The bleak, empty dread of this movie stuck with me for days. Few movies that I have seen have ever captured that sick, hollow feeling of realising that you will die one day. In this movie, death breathes these characters in the neck and turns them into paranoid, vile creatures.", "This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but with a wimper. ", "With that said, this is not a particularly exciting movie and I do understand the criticism of those claiming to be disappointed and feeling tricked. I recommend going in with a clean slate, not watching any trailers and don't watch it on a movie night with friends.", "This film was very good and at the time I thought this is perfectly paced. Then I was ready to see what was coming at night then the credits came up. I was felt robbed. Such an anti climax!!!", "From the description of the movie on Netflix - and the title of the movie itself - I was expecting \"It Comes at Night\" to be a full blooded horror movie. But in actual fact, it really isn't. Though there are a few creepy sequences, the movie is more of a straight drama, a kind of post-apocalypse movie that spends most of its time running at a fairly sober level. Actually, the movie being different than what I expected didn't bother me at all. What did bother me was that there are some key features of the movie that don't have enough explanation at all. For example, the part where the dog goes crazy and runs off, and a later scene about a door being open mysteriously. The movie definitely has some strengths - it does not spoon-feed its audience about the plot setup, instead making you learn little by little what happened. There are some tense moments, dramatic and/or creepy. And I wasn't bored at any moment. But the many unexplained questions that come up ultimately make this a (near) miss. Still, if the filmmakers attempt to make another movie, I will give it a look, since there were some good things in this film, and they may have learned from their mistakes here.", "...but I was surprised. Got the same feeling from this movie as I got with The Bunker (2001),", "It doesn't focus to much on the horror aspect but lets call it psychological horror.\nSo for all your slasher horror fans this movie is a waste of time. This movie focus more on the human aspect when a disaster (in this case an illness) is decimating the human population. The distrust for other people (families) and the loyalty to your own.", "I had to watch this movie with subtitles and periodically doubling my TV volume because the dialog volume would go up & down during every conversation.\nIf your goal is to let the audience know what your writers wrote & actors spoke, try to not mumble and whisper every other word, and perhaps have the sound mixed properly.\nOther movies sound just fine on my tv. This one was just done poorly as far as the sound quality."]},

The film could better be named \"Trolls 3\" in which we realize we've been trolled yet again.", "Whats worst is how we made a review system to avoid piece o crud films and even that has been abused by the industry which has caught on and now posts fake positive reviews to abuse our honest rating systems. ", "So where as the film has no sound conclusion, let me give you a meaningful one: the film industry doesnt care about us and would rather us go broke being force fed vomit than listen to us and take us seriously. How many talented scripts get rejected to make way for crud like this? One too many. i quit.", "I went to a sneak peek yesterday so I had no idea this movie was going to be shown.", "I expected this to be a horrormovie but instead it was just a boring movie and in my opinion a waste of time.", "The movie begins quite interesting but the longer the movie goes, the more lame it gets. The whole movie is filmed in and around a house in the woods. The acting is okay but not overwhelming. Many questions are not answered. 5 Million Dollars for what?! In the end I was just laughing because it was so bad. ", "I would not recommend this movie at all!", "Rating :- 6+ (for this kind of movie... Really users ? OMG)\nGenre :- Horror, Mystery (Horror hahaha lol HHOORRRROORR el-oO-el and Mystery ... yes why you made this movie is a real mystery )", "Users please don't give unusual ratings to movies as it spoils the mood of the viewers", "The movie started well and there were some suspenseful spots. Towards the middle it starts to slow down and you start to wonder is this a virus outbreak or Zombie apocalypse? Towards the end it escalates and you're hoping to find the origin of the terror THEN IT ENDS!!! This was worse than the Sopranos cutting to black. NOTHING was answered!!!", "You will feel well rested after watching this snoozefest.", "There has been an onslaught of post-apocalyptic films in the past decade, with some garnering more success and viewers than others. This trend has transcended budgets of all sizes, from gargantuan studio efforts like 'World War Z' to indies like 'It Comes at Night.'", "The latter of which was made for a minuscule $5M yet stars some acclaimed actors in Joel Edgerton and Carmen Ejogo. The setting - a boarded up house in the woods that is removed from inferred death and destruction that is ravaging the globe in the form of a sickness that infects and ultimately kills its hosts. While this is not the most original premise, it certainly shows promise.", "With such a small budget and cast, it's imperative that the story and acting are strong enough to carry the entire film. 'Night' hits on a few solid points, from its filming style to its use not just of sound, but silence, as well. The Edgerton and Ejogo do respectable jobs, but it is perhaps their on-screen son Travis (played by Kelvin Harrison, Jr.) who has the biggest impact. The 17-year-old is a typical teenager who wants to prove his worth but is consistently held back by his father out of fear of injury or infection. When a young family comes into their safe house, it's clear Travis' innocence is juxtaposed with his father's skepticism, and age is clearly a driving force between this.", "There is also a fair amount of symbolism in 'Night.' The use of the red door - the only way in or out of the boarded up house - as seen in dream sequences is one element that is recurring throughout the film. The relationships between the families are also very important to the overall progression of the film, but something just doesn't add up. As seen in the climax of 'Night,' it's as if there was a missing link in the chain - and what results is pretty underwhelming to viewers.", "'It Comes at Night' is not a horror film. It's a psychological drama, and the mis-marketing of the movie is likely what left many dissatisfied. But even putting that aside, the film is only mediocre when viewed as a whole - a disappointment considering it had many elements that are needed for a solid product in this genre.", "Worst ever movie ever watched. damn !ruined my day", "What a gorgeously shot, well-acted, but totally stupid movie. I want my time back. I could have watched a test pattern. Not as big a waste of time as Darren Aronofsky's piece of crap, \"Mother!\" But it is in the same ballpark. Do not waste your time. Please!", "I watched the first 5 minutes of it and I honestly want that 5 minutes of my life back.", "Such a pathetically slow moving movie with annoyingly melodramatic dialogue that I just couldn't handle.", "I scanned through the rest of the movie and saw it was pretty much just a bunch of scenes where the actors were pulling faces the whole time.", "Boring!", "A film with no real need to be made. People living in the wood shooting people at night. No Horror , no story, no point watching till the end but I had to watch it thinking it may get better- but no its crap.", "I first thought that the title sounded very juvenile. Reminds me of amateurs who put up a billboard that says, \"IT is COMING.\" They smile to themselves but give only consternation to their target audience. ", "But of course, this year Stephen King's movie AND this movie have proven me wrong because you apparently don't have to be very creative with your title to reach the masses.", "Still...", "THE PRODUCERS HAVE BETRAYED MY TRUST AND I WILL NEVER WATCH ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR MOVIES!", "As other's have said, nothing lives up to the title. Nothing comes at night. \nAside from the deceptive marketing by the greedy producers, there actually are some good qualities. Basically, they pulled off a very good, low-budget depressing drama.", "It is good for what it is. I am old enough to remember all the hype with The Blair Witch Project. My friends and I were having lunch when a reviewer on the radio said, \"This is an amazing movie and to think it was made my college students!\"\nWe all said, \"Enough! We give in. We will go see it right now.\"\nWell, when the house lights came back on we just sat and stared at each other and the others around the theater and said, \"You're kidding. We've been had!\" This isn't an amazing film for being produced by a bunch of college students. This is EXACTLY what a very good college film looks like! Are the critics so out of touch with reality that they don't know what a college student film looks like?", "The same thing with The Evil Dead. It is not an amazing film on it's own rights. It is just a very good indie film by a young Sam Raimi college student. Or take the movie Open Water where the scuba divers are stranded. It is not an amazing film. It is just a very good low-budget indie film", "All of these films had no real story and no satisfying ending.\nAnother example with a bigger budget and an excellent writer and director is Frank Darabont's The Mist. Just proves that those of us who want a climactic, heroic ending can be victims of advertising. All of these movies failed to live up to my expectations because of the false hype and unsatisfying endings.", "Now, if you changed the title from IT COMES AT NIGHT to IT COMES FOR EVERYONE that would have been a little more truthful.\nNot that the title change alone could save this movie. There were too many unfulfilled expectations.", "SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS.", "The boy sees something in the woods and it is never resolved.", "The dog comes back-- a mystery that is never answered.", "We are invested in the characters, and receive no reward for our investment.", "To be fair, there are clues as to what the director was trying to tell us.\nApparently we are supposed to deduce that the boy opened the door and therefore got infected by the dog. Which ultimately leads us to the depressing ending of the infection spreading to everyone and the last couple sitting at the table waiting to die. But there is a fine line between telling the audience too much and not telling them enough. ", "This is a good character piece, but not a movie for people who enjoy a good story. ", "A case in point: I was amazed that the Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy movies Before Sunrise and the sequels got such high reviews. I realized that for some people there doesn't need to be a story so much as vicarious involvement in engaging characters. ", "Personally, I prefer a good story. ", "There was a lot of buzz about The Sixth Sense. It had a new writer and director (Night Shyamalan) and an excellent performance by Haley Joel Osment. But the reason people went back to see it a second time was because of the fulfilling story with a satisfying pay off. ", "The same thing is true of The Orphanage. ", "And more recently, the movie Get Out. Which arguably also has an unimpressive title until you actually watch the movie. ", "These movies have stories that give you a payoff. ", "Yes we should as a culture be mature enough to watch a Greek Tragedy once in awhile. ", "But you should not be set up to expect a creature thriller.", "This cover (and indeed trailer) makes a promise the book just can't keep in this case. ", "The first part of the movie builds up your expectations to the maximum, I mean you are ready to fall off your seat and bite through your fingernails, and the second part makes you say: \"Wait, that's it?! Then what was that earlier set up for? And that other set up... and that other set up... and so on. What was the point?\"", "Exactly what most of us are asking by the end of the movie: What was the point?", "First of all, it really isn't a horror movie. It's supposed to be a suspense movie. It really doesn't have a plot so the fact it doesn't have a 3rd Act is not surprising. I actually was taken by surprise by the ending because the movie just stops. There are no character arcs because there is no character development. Joel Edgerton is one of my least favorite actors. He pretty much bombs every movies he's in with his heavy-handed attempts at being a character actor. This movie hints at some things that may be lurking under the surface but those things never emerge because the writer doesn't know what they are. The young black kid, Kelvin Harrison Jr. is good but he's not given much to do. We never find out how or why the world is the way is. Basically you know nothing more by the film's end than you did in the beginning. Not even why you sat through the whole thing. You can miss this movie without missing it, if you get my drift. The good reviews must be paid bots. No human being could enjoy this. Don't waste your time."]},

As a precaution they keep the doors and windows nailed-locked, avoid getting out at night, and use gas masks and gloves to protect themselves.

It Comes at Night tries to explore the human nature and survivalism and succeeds a bit, but that does not mean it stops being unexciting. The teen in the film is desperate to explore sexuality but the only available option is out of bounds. A situation like the one in the film can limit life's possibilities and remind us of our primal forbearers, and Shults may have wanted to express that.

This is thanks largely to a degree of mystery and ambiguity surrounding the context of the 'outbreak' and its origins. Not knowing what exactly is happening, or why, helps to distinguish the piece from other films with similarly small scale gritty takes on the end of the world.

He turns in another one of his put-upon everyman characters - something he has become an expert in portraying - and the intensity of his performance keeps the disappointingly pedestrian story alive. The rest of the cast lack his fervent energy and their characters feel flat by comparison, but that is mostly due to how they have been written. Consequentially, it is difficult to fully invest in their plight and fight to survive. You don't want anything bad to happen to them but you're not desperately rooting for them to live happily ever after either.

Way too many previews before the movie began is ridiculous. (That should have been a clue) This by far is the worst movie I've seen. Still wondering what \"it\" is. Moral of the story, I wasted $1.59 renting this. I should have been paid to watch it.", "I enjoyed it to some extent. The setting was pretty good and the whole slow burn approach was enjoyable, but it suffered from trying to be needlessly clever. Some examples:", "How does a dog get through a locked door? How do people hugging and kissing their kid not get infected when he got infected simply by holding a kids hand? How long has this been going on? How many people have the killed already because they are far too ruthless to be new at it? Is the kid slow or do they just treat him like he is?", "Yeah it's nice to have somethings left ambiguous, but dogs getting through locked doors isn't a mystery you can dwell on and come up with multiple plausible answers. There are no plausible answers. ", "The other part of the problem is I didn't like the characters at all. Which is fine if they are well developed, but just unlikable, but that isn't the case here. They are just figures to execute the plot and nothing more.", "In my opinion it was a good idea that was just very poorly executed with a director who was trying to be a little too cute.", "This movie could have been so good but literally nothing cool happened, except when Edgerton slipped and fell in the woods. It was suspenseful which is what kept us watching but we were left waiting for something to happen :/ was the family sick? Were they not sick? They just were murdered for the son to die? Ugh! Nobody even turned into a zombie!!!!! I know I'm not the only one who was waiting for some post apocalyptic zombie action", "Two families are forced to share a home in an uneasy alliance to keep the outside evil at bay only to discover that the true horror comes from within.", "Director Trey Edward Shults' It Comes at Night is a taught effective horror drama, its strength lay in the audience using their imagination proving again that what's left unseen can be just as horrifying as anything on the screen. Reminiscent in tone of Into the Forest (2015), The Thing (1982) (echoing its paranoia) it's ambiguity, natural setting and Brian McOmber's subtle score all add up to something quite engaging. ", "The cast are effective, the child actor is natural, also Kelvin Harrison Jr. playing Travis, a 17 year old suffering from gory nightmares feels believable but it's edgy Joel Edgerton's Paul and convincing Christopher Abbott's Will that are the glue and shine here. Both roles have an intensity and both men ooze tension. Shults offers a well shot horror, drama that's brilliantly paced, with an eerie atmosphere aided by Drew Daniels immaculate cinematography. ", "Shults never plays his cards and as a viewer you're fed little bits of information, not really knowing the scale of what's going on. With characters with welts, checking teeth, nails and burning bodies, the interesting thing is that you also don't know if what they're afraid of changes you into a monster or rabid zombie or something else. Refreshingly the viewer doesn't see what they fear, and you shouldn't need to either. There are a few shoot outs and stand offs but it works more on a psychological level, less is more here and with rife paranoia this offering excels. Recommended.", "I am losing more and more respect for the authenticity of IMDb ratings.", "This is one of the worst rated films I've seen on this site.", "Completely horrible movie with no plot.", "Read what all the other posters wrote with one star ratings.", "There is absolutely nothing horrific about this movie except the rating that IMDb gave to it.", "Spoiler Alert: if you hate open endings, that is the least of this movies issues. Like other reviews, nothing comes at night. I was really looking forward to this movie as I read good things and I am starting to really doubt the ratings on IMDb. In the past year I have not seen so many movies that had a good rating on this site that were actually terrible. Save yourself the time and skip this movie. It is incredibly bad and at the end you will find yourself saying \"WTF?!\" just as I did."]},

", "I expected this movie to be a horror film but it just turned out to be a mediocre drama.", "If you want to watch a horror film, skip this one.", "This movie is a well-shot, well-acted low-budget paranoid psychological thriller with horror elements. Had it have been entitled something less misleading than 'It Comes at Night', I would have given it 8, possibly 9 stars out of 10. So why can't I give it 8, or 9 stars out of 10? Well, because absolutely NOTHING comes at night.", "Oh I'm sure the director has a million clever little excuses to explain the fact that they lied to get people to watch this movie, by selling it as something it wasn't. I am equally sure that they are all disingenuous justifications, and that they deliberately gave their slow, but very well-made film a misleading title in order to trick people through the doors of the cinema into watching it.", "I like films like this, I have plenty of patience with films that are slow-paced, but well-acted, as this one is. I like ambiguous films where the motivations of characters are unsure, and their situation not clear. I would have liked this movie so much more if I hadn't been sitting through it waiting for 'it' to come at night.", "I cannot overstate how much this misleading title ruined my enjoyment of the film, or how annoyed I am that an otherwise enjoyable, slow-paced indie thriller, was ruined by money-men who didn't have enough confidence in their own film to let it stand on its own merits.", "Good film, as long a you don't get fooled by the title.", "that was about the dumbest, most pointless movie I've seen in a long time and I try to avoid those as much as possible. They never explained what the \"sickness\" was, where it originated, where they were, they didn't even show their food supply and how they intended to just survive in the house forever out in the middle of nowhere smh, avoid", "Don't let the title fool you this movie is an absolute waste of time, if you have nothing to do and want something to put you to sleep this will do the job,their is nothing coming at night nor at day time this was supposed to be a horror, mystery,not a drama please don't waste your time,rather take a nap.", "I went into the movie with no background, just saw the title, the rating, the genre, and thought it was worth a watch.", "I think this helped. It kept the suspense up until the very last minute, but then disappointment sunk in.", "As every other review has said, nothing comes at night. The title itself is, in my opinion, to keep the suspense up as you're waiting for the thing that never arrives.", "It's alright as a mind game movie I guess. Although if you read these reviews it'll probably all be lost on you, because you know the title is frivolous.", "Anyway, 4/10 because it kept the suspense up, but feel like it was a waste of time in the end. I wish they at least explored the characters a bit deeper. I mean Wills \"my brother did this\" \"I'm an only child.. oh I mean.. my brother.. is my wives brother.. because we're close\" was obviously leading you to think Will was dodgy, but they never touched anywhere near that ever again.", "I'm pretty sure the whole point of the movie was to build up suspense. They definitely achieved that, but never getting any kind of relief isn't my cup of tea.", "It is painfully evident after watching a boat load of post apocalyptic movies and TV shows that humanity is done for.", "Whatever causes our way of life to end, be it war, disease, the walking dead; or some natural disaster that wipes out our infrastructure, power grid, and well just about everything we depend on these days; we're screwed.", "We are not going to come together as one and work for the common good. We are not going to reach out and lend helping hands. True, groups will form (more like packs I predict) and those who are survivalists who have been preparing for some kind of end -of-it-all will have their enclaves with \"shoot on sight\" rules to keep anyone else from coming in. They'll outlast everyone but eventually, maybe years after the cataclysm, inbreeding or short supplies will waste them away, too.", "I suppose the government bunkers (which I have no doubt exist and have since the cold war) where the elite of our government and scientists will seek shelter in might save the human race from extinction. Yet, spend too much time underground, and people become Trogalytes!", "This film shines a light on a small group of people, two families, who band together in a good sized cabin in the woods to make due as best they can while the outside world succumbs to a nameless plague. Yet even with small numbers, fear and mistrust raise their ugly heads.", "The message is we are our own enemies. All it takes is a little push to get us all fighting each other instead of working with each other.", "I gave this film a five for the good acting. As far as a horror movie? Not by today's expectations."]}
